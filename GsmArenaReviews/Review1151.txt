			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony was the talk of town during CES 2012 back in January and the Xperia ion for AT&amp;T was among the main reasons why. Launched alongside the Xperia S, the Sony Xperia ion took the great honor of being the company's first LTE smartphone. To make the matters even more epic, the smartphone marked Sony Mobile's grand return to the most lucrative segment of the US smartphone market - that of the high-end, tricked out handsets with spec sheets as long as a daily newspaper. In a nutshell, the Sony Xperia ion was a big deal anyway you looked at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arriving to the market six months after its announcement, the Sony Xperia ion has a different smartphone landscape to face. Samsung and HTC have already released their heavy hitters in the United States, packing better internals, and offering more up-to-date software experience. To put it mildly - arriving late to the party, the Sony Xperia ion now finds itself outgunned by the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What makes this occurrence particularly frustrating is the fact that this wasn't the case at the smartphone's announcement six months ago. Back in January, the Xperia ion for AT&amp;T could go have a go at any top-of-the-line Android smartphone on the market and emerge victorious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To offset the massive delay, the Sony Xperia ion is priced quite aggressively. AT&amp;T asks only $99.99 for the smartphone. Should you choose to pick one up directly from Sony though, you will only have to shell out $49.99 with a two-year contract. Cutting edge it might be not, but the Sony Xperia ion still offers you a lot of smartphone for the money. Here goes the list of its full talents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you have probably noticed above, the Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T is rather closely related to the Xperia S, which came to be quite popular. In order to be more appealing to the US users however, the handset has seen its screen stretch up a bit. The microSD card slot is also a nice addition to the spec sheet - after all, the handset is made for consuming multimedia and playing videogames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest letdown about the Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T is undoubtedly the lack of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box. Sony's customization of Android 2.3 Gingerbread is quite polished but still - it simply does not befit a mid-2012 high-end device. The battery life could have also been much better, given the handset's knack for multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we are going to kick things off with an unboxing of the Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A retail box to match the price tag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like with the case of other $99 smartphones, the Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T won't blow you away with its retail package. Inside the orange/white colored box, you will find a charger and a microUSB cable, along with the usual set of booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite frankly, a set of headphones would have been much appreciated here, especially given Sony's own lineup of accessories. In the case of the AT&amp;T flavored Xperia ion however, you will have to get one on your own dime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion is a well-designed piece of hardware. The handset recently won a Red Dot award for its pleasantly understated looks. However, for every person who thinks that the Xperia ion is a looker, there's probably another who would brand the device as being dull. On our end, we can't help but note, that the transparent strip, found in the Xperia S would have added a welcome touch of character to the Xperia ion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is superb. The Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T is a blend of high-quality plastic and metal, while the handset's screen is scratch proof - even the pickiest user will have a hard time finding something to frown about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Sony Xperia ion are fairly acceptable for a device with such a massive screen. They are 133 x 68 x 10.8 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 144 grams. The only negative worth noting here is the handset's thickness, which is far from great. In any case, the Xperia ion won't tear a hole in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.55" screen of the device is truly great. Backed by Sony's BRAVIA engine, the display is sharp, offers great color reproduction, and good contrast. Its pixel density of 323ppi is not as high as the 342ppi found in the Sony Xperia S's unit, but it's well on par with a the latest iPhone Retina screens offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot going on above the display. There, you will find the ambient light and proximity sensors, the earpiece, an indicator light, as well as the 1.3MP front-facing camera. Below the screen is where the four capacitive buttons for navigating Android reside. Their sensitivity is far from the greatest we've encountered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB and microHDMI ports are neatly located under a cover on the left side of the phone. There is nothing else to be found there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things get busier on the right side as it is the home of the power/lock key, the volume rocker, as well as the dedicated button for the 12MP snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the device, you will find the lonely 3.5mm audio jack sitting at the center. There's nothing but a mouthpiece at the bottom of the Xperia ion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 12MP camera and its LED flash light are located on the back. The loudspeaker grille can be found immediately below them. The green logo and Xperia letters at the bottom hark back to the Sony Ericsson heritage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card slot and the microSD card slot are stealthily tucked in under a small cover, located right above the camera sensor. Removing it takes place by pressing with your thumbs on its sides and sliding up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1900mAh non-removable battery of the Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T achieved an endurance rating of 31 hours in our traditional battery test. This means that you can expect the Xperia ion to last you just a bit over a full day, should you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback every daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out all about the battery performance of the handset in this post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Sony Xperia ion is relatively easy for its size. Even one handed operation is possible on most occasions. The curved back allows the device to fit comfortably in hand, and reduces the risk of drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we'll give excellent marks for build quality of the Sony Xperia ion. Design on the other hand is strictly a matter of personal perception. Battery life could have been much better, but we are not surprised by the Xperia ion's showing on this instance - the combination of Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 with HD screen and LTE is a well recorded energy hog by now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the (ageing) software of the Sony Xperia ion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread for now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T, like the rest of the NXT series, runs Android Gingerbread 2.3.7 with an ICS update coming up later on. We've seen the same UI combo on the Xperia S, the sola, the Xperia P, and Xperia U, so we'll cut straight to the demo video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion has the usual five-pane homescreen (you can't add or delete panes), with four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). These are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All active widgets gather there for easy viewing and selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion has some custom-made Sony widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows notifications for Facebook events too. A cool new addition to the lockscreen, unseen in the old Xperia line, is the music player widget, which lets you control music playback without unlocking the phone - we'll get back to this further on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for - no custom touches to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color themes are also part of the Sony Xperia ion's user interface. There are several of them preinstalled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T is powered by a dual-core Scorpion CPU clocked at 1.5 GHz and 1GB of RAM. Back at the time of the smartphone's announcement, those were as good as it could possibly get. These days however, they are considered mid-range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual round of benchmarks and compared the Xperia ion to a selection of popular upper-midrange competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start with Benchmark Pi, which measures the CPU computing power of the Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 chipset. The Xperia ion could have done much better here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Linpack the Xperia ion does slightly better than its sibling, the Sony Xperia S. It is however, far from the heavy hitters in the dual-core Android realm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider favors the superior JavaScript performance of Ice Cream Sandwich, so the Xperia ion is at a disadvantage here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion scores quite low at the BrowserMark HTML5 test. Once again the smartphone is hampered by its Android version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 is where the GPU gets to show its worth. Sony's Xperia ion scored 37.3 fps, which is right in line with the Xperia S's accomplishment, but worse than the latest crop of Android top dogs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion is well-equipped to tackle routine tasks. It fails to match the speed and capacity of some of the competition, but that's something for the most demanding of power users to worry about. Android Ice Cream Sandwich would have surely bumped up some of the benchmark results, so hopefully the wait for it would not be too long.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The visually customized phonebook of the Xperia ion can store extensive information about all your contacts. A tabbed interface presents contact details, recent calls and info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (you can fine-sift specific groups from an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "join" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the + and x buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. In each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has no smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had no problems making and receiving calls on the Xperia ion. Calls were loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the Xperia ion does not offer smart dialing. We can't help but wonder why, as the feature is present on other Sony smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. You can also access detailed log information by tapping the arrow next to a number. Once you start typing though, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Favorite tab that displays starred contacts, but you can add other contacts to the list too. The tab displays a grid of contact photos with their first name underneath.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All texts and MMS are organized into threads. Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual messages can be starred and you can find all of them in the Starred folder available in the context menu. This is a nice way to mark important messages that you'll need to find quickly later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email app can do that however. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A preview pane splits the screen in half - one side lists the emails, while the other shows the currently selected email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works both in portrait and landscape and you can easily drag the separator between the two areas to make one bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia ion offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Even the portrait keyboard allows fairly precise two-thumb typing. The stock Gingerbread keyboard is at your disposal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, comfortably spaced buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of customizations, the Xperia ion keyboard features the so-called Gesture input. It works the same as Swype.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plain vanilla gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn't really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, and shows full resolution images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should have noticed the two switches at the top by now. The first opens a different gallery section that stores your 3D panorama sshots, while the second opens the Sweep Multi Angle sshots section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the 3D panoramas in 3D, you need to connect your phone to a compatible 3DTV. Multi Angle sshots are harder to view outside the device as you need something with an accelerometer and the proper app - you best bet is another Xperia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Picasa albums are distinguished by the small logo of the corresponding service. Facebook pictures can be "liked" with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use pinch zoom or the old-fashioned +/- buttons. If you pan past the edge of a photo, the gallery will load up the next (or previous) image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps would normally lead to artefacts, but you'll have to look from really up close to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player with good codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia ion as in most of the droids out there. DivX, XviD and MKV videos are supported but the Xperia ion has a rather selective filtering and not all videos got through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion managed to play every MP4 file we threw at it, even the 1080p videos. Most of the high-res DivX/XviD/MKV files did run too. Unfortunately, the Xperia ion has rather patchy audio codec support, most notably AC-3 is not on the list. So, some videos played without audio and some with unsupported bitrate didn't pass at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no subtitle support and there is no way you can see video information (file name, codec, size, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich music experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion has the same music player that we liked on the Xperia S. You're welcomed to a Cover Flow-like interface and you can swipe left and right to skip tracks (complete with a smooth 3D effect).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the Playing tab, the second tab available is called My Music and it's where your music library is organized. Tracks are sorted by album, artist, playlist, all tracks, SensMe channel, and favorites. There's also a link to Sony's Music Unlimited service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Now playing interface, there's the familiar Infinite button - it gives you quick options to find the music or karaoke videos on YouTube for the current song, look for more tracks on PlayNow, search Wikipedia for info on the artist or look for lyrics on Google. New features can be added to this menu with extensions available in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SensMe should be familiar from those old Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. In case you've missed it, SensMe filters songs by mood. By default, there are nine "channels" - daytime, energetic, relax, upbeat, mellow, lounge, emotional, dance and extreme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to download SensMe data before you can use this feature. Luckily, you no longer have to use a PC Suite to tag songs - you just need an Internet connection, the phone will handle the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audiophiles will appreciate the rich selection of equalizer presets. There's a custom preset too - it lets you adjust five frequency bands and there's a Clear Bass slider too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The More tab offers a Headphone surround option, which can be set to Studio, Club or Concert hall. If you're not using the headphones, you can turn the xLOUD feature on, which optimizes the sound for the Xperia ion loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature is the track info and playback controls available on the lockscreen, which let you control the player without having to unlock the phone. The music controls replace the clock, which might be annoying if you just want to check the time. Still, the clock slides out of view, so you have about a second to see what time it is (or just look at the small clock in the upper right corner).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion is equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places "notches" on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. There's a Force mono option to use in case of poor reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is also available and works within the radio app. You can even like a song on Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor stereo crosstalk damages the audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion LTE audio quality turned out decent for the most part, but its high stereo crosstalk reading came as a huge surprise to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Sony flagship has faultless frequency response and very good signal-to-noise ration and dynamic range, but there seems to be a lot of leakage between the two channels. The distortion levels are kept well under control, too. Still, we wouldn't expect anything but faultless output from a flagship smartphone like this and the Xperia ion LTE falls a bit short of the mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 12MP camera could have done much better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion has a 12 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED light. It's capable of producing images with resolution of 4000 x 3000 pixels, and packs Sony's usual panorama and 3D photo mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia ion are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. On the left you get four shortcuts to various settings, while the still camera/camcorder toggle, the virtual shutter key and a thumbnail of the last photo taken are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings up two pages of extra settings: scenes, resolution, smile detection, geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode, among others. You can customize three of the shortcuts on the left (the shooting mode shortcut is fixed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're five capture modes to choose from: Normal, Scene recognition, Sweep Panorama, Sweep Multi Angle and 3D Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia S take a guess (it's fairly good at it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Sweep Panorama is business as usual - you press the shutter key and pan the phone across the scene. The resulting panoramic photo can be viewed in both 2D and 3D (on a compatible TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sweep Multi Angle is much more impressive - you take a photo in the exact same way, but the result is very different. It produces something like a lenticular card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting the phone lets you look at the object from different sides. A shot of a moving object looks like an animated GIF or creates interesting distortions, which can be pretty funny too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion features a Quick launch option, which lets you customize the phone's behavior upon a press of the camera key when the phone is locked. The default option is Launch and capture - it unlocks the phone, starts the camera and instantly snaps a photo - a rather uncomfortable choice because it's nearly impossible to correctly frame a picture before the screen is on. This usually produces images with motion blur. The other option is to just unlock the phone and start the camera, or you can disable the feature completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware shutter key on the Xperia ion does a good job. The phone itself is comfortable to hold. Still, pressing the shutter key all the way down requires too much effort for shake-free shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion may have a 12MP sensor, but from where we see it, it's more of a marketing gimmick than a real-world advantage. The image quality is actually nice, but only when you view the photos without any zooming. In fit-to-screen mode on our 1080p monitor, the photos looked nice and lively, perhaps just a bit oversaturated, but generally pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in to 100%, at pixel-per-pixel level, we see a different story. The photos produced by the Xperia ion have above the average noise levels even in broad daylight. The resolved detail is not more than the one offered by the better 8MP cameraphones (well, perhaps the macro shot of the wrist watch being the only exception).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, on all photos the foliage in the trees have an unnatural watercolor look, which most of the 8MP competitors get right even at 100% magnification. It's the result of the Xperia ion's uneven struggle with the noise. Noise reduction algorithms take their toll on the fine detail and grass and foliage is usually where it gets hit first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, though it may seem that the Xperia ion is an imaging-centric device, the reality is it only has an average camera and it looks Sony engineers have not put much effort into it either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video recording is not much better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion camera offers 1080p video capture @ 30fps, matching what we saw in the Xperia S. The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera, including focus mode, metering, exposure value, image stabilization and so on. The layout of the shortcuts can be customized here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video is probably a department where the Xperia ion can redeem itself of the average still performance. Unfortunately, most of the video we shot with it came out focused at a closer distance than we would have liked, eventually rendering slightly out of focus everything further than 5-10m. As a result videos from the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S III have stunningly more detail than those of the ion. The good thing is you can only tell the difference when you compare those head to head. On their own, the Xperia ion videos look as good as any other recent cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the videos by the Xperia ion turn out slightly better than average but nothing to write home about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the video samples we captured with the Xperia ion below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched 1080p@30fps sample, taken straight off the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>NFC-enabled connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion has quad-band 2G and tri-band 3G. The latter is decently fast with 21Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, being an LTE device, the real 4G is among the phone's greatest talents. We have to tip our hat to AT&amp;T for offering a great LTE experience where available, with speeds often exceeding 40Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA TV or music player. This is handled through the Connected Devices app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard microHDMI port is the other way to put multimedia on the big screen. Its functionality holds no surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion also supports NFC, so you can read NFC tags and make the phone act as a tag itself. You can create multiple tags and choose which one you want to share. A tag can be anything from contact info (usually yours so you can send it as a sort of wireless business card), a URL or just plain text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion saves NFC tags you've scanned with it and you can even star some of them for easier access later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the Sony Smart Tag accessories (since none came in the box, you have to get some separately). They can be set to trigger different actions - there's a long list of options available and multiple actions can be triggered at once by one tag. To streamline the process, you can use the Smart Tags widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can give names to tags to help you remember where you placed each one. Here are some of the actions available: control Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi hotspot, Bluetooth, GPS, sound mode, you can have the phone open a URL, play a track, send a text, enable text to speech, change the wallpaper or launch an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With this functionality at your fingertips, you can automate a lot of things. For example, a tag in your car can switch on Bluetooth so the phone pairs up with the car audio, enable GPS and launch the SatNav app and enable text to speech, which will read incoming texts out loud.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web Browsing the Gingerbread way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is a simple, familiar Gingerbread affair. It has almost no visible chrome by default, but once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring out the browser controls you hit the menu key and six keys pop up. They offer options like opening a new tab, switching tabs, refreshing the page, going forward, and opening bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons. There's text reflow, which reformats text so that it best fits on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing performance is excellent - panning, zooming and the text reflow are very fluid thanks to the dual-core processor. The 4.55" HD screen also offers enough room for elaborate web pages, and the 323ppi pixel density means that text doesn't start getting blurry until the size is almost too small to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important features in the web browser is the full Flash 11 support. YouTube videos worked in the browser and so did flash games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is fine and dandy, but we quite like the experimental Quick controls in Ice Cream Sandwich, the new tab switching interface (same as the app switcher) and the ability to install Google Chrome for Android, which are just some of the things you miss out on with Gingerbread.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ion comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app. Reading documents is quite comfortable and panning is blazing fast. Files don't need to be stored locally - the app offers cloud integration (Google, Dropbox, Box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a built-in file browser too, but it only works with Office docs, so it's not a replacement for a real file browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries but you can't edit them on the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can expand advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) by turning the phone landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a World clock, along with stopwatch and timer functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver app helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three presets in total. The other two are a manual power saver and a timed saver. The latter can, say, keep all those power-hungry features off for the night and turn them back on in the morning.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ion comes with a GPS receiver, which took a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.) and you shouldn't have a problem running most apps (though the ones that require ICS are still out of the Xperia ion's reach).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's be honest here - Sony missed a great opportunity with the Xperia ion for AT&amp;T. Had the device hit the shelves shortly after its announcement, it would have enjoyed a flagship status and a higher price tag, along with the potential for selling in significant numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T still offers great value for its price tag, despite not being a top dog anymore. Solid build, gorgeous screen, and award winning looks are likely to attract buyers. Having AT&amp;T's blazing LTE network speeds on board doesn't hurt either. The power for Sony as a premium brand would help the Xperia ion's cause as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, if you really want to grab a Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T, you will have to make do with Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread. This is absolutely inexcusable for a smartphone with a spec sheet as the Xperia ion's, coming to the market this far into 2012. We are not sure who's to blame for this - we know that the HSPA version of the device ships with Ice Cream Sandwich, so AT&amp;T's approval process might have something to do with the presence of the ageing Google OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the capacitive buttons below the phone's display could have also been better. Not to mention the performance of the 12MP snapper - we really had high hopes for it, but it simply didn't deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned to you that AT&amp;T is asking $99.99 for the Sony Xperia ion. On this instance, we would highly recommend that you go ahead and grab one directly from Sony, as it will cost you half as much with a two-year commitment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For $49.99, the Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T is really a smartphone deal to consider. Here are some other options too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will begin with two Samsung Galaxy S II versions, which are part of AT&amp;T's smartphone lineup. The I777 is the closest relative to the already legendary I9100. It will entice you with a polished ICS experience and better performance for $99.99. For the same price, the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket is also a great option. It shares most internals as the Xperia ion, LTE included, but comes with a more energy-efficient Super AMOLED Plus screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy S II I777 &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket i727</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Vivid and Amaze 4G are also viable options. Both will offer Android ICS and better camera performance. The AT&amp;T exclusive HTC Vivid packs LTE, while the T-Mobile flavored Amaze 4G has 42Mbps HSPA+ on tap. The Vivid will cost you $49.99 from AT&amp;T, while the Amaze 4G is currently offered for free with a two-year commitment to T-Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Vivid &#x2022; HTC Amaze 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If money is not an issue, the best thing you can do is opt for the latest crop of high-end Android devices. A budget of $199.99 will get you the likes of Samsung Galaxy S III, HTC One X, or HTC Evo 4G LTE. Each of those three is a mighty better alternative to the Sony Xperia ion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S III I747 &#x2022; HTC One X AT&amp;T &#x2022; HTC Evo 4G LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there are plenty of options out there. The Sony Xperia ion for AT&amp;T has plenty of charm on its own and will surely find its fans out there, as long as they are willing to make a few compromises. We can't however, shake off the feeling of a missed opportunity on Sony's behalf - the handset would have done much better a few months ago.</paragraph>
