			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the Compact family, Sony has quite a reputation to live up to. The Z3 Compact is arguably one of the company's most-successful models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amidst an industry increasingly pushing toward more and more screen real estate, sometimes to absurd levels, as much as 6.0-inches in a handheld device, there is an ever-growing niche for high-end devices on the sub 5.0-inch scale. The Z5 Compact embodies that same concept - flagship-grade specs in a compact body with a 4.6-inch display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the kind of horsepower the Z5 Compact has, it can definitely handle anything you throw its way. The high-end Qualcomm 810 chipset also comes with a powerful Adreno 430 GPU, just like the one in the Z5. Coupled with an HD resolution should equal some impressive pixel-pushing performance. Gaming should be a fluent experience all around, given you don't mind some eye-strain on the 4.6 inch display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the new chipset, there is also the new 23MP camera on the back and 5.1MP one on the front, both borrowed from the Z5. Also, the fingerprint reader, conveniently embedded inside the power button, which is arguable one of the most convenient approaches to date. Throw in a slightly bigger battery, some slight hardware upgrades such as Bluetooth 4.1, faster Cat.6 LTE and software improvements and you get about pretty much all improvements the Z5 Compact has to offer over its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't help but feel that phone could have delivered bigger upgrades than that. The resolution is still the same at 720p, so is the amount of RAM at 2GB, combine that with the inevitable price difference and you are in a situation where the already popular Z3 Compact could remain a better deal for a lot of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the price difference between the pair is significant at around ?150, making life a bit hard for the Z5 Compact, especially if it aspires to be as successful as its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The most important thing is that the Z5 Compact looks and feels like a genuinely new product and not just some slightly updated version of its precursor. That's alone is enough to warrant a full length review. So jump on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z5 Compact 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact boasts a slick and clean exterior. It is styled entirely following Sony's new minimalistic design language.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One thing is definitely changed on the Z5 Compact and that is the design. With the Z5 series Sony is making a significant revision of its signature design language. It is the biggest such undertaking since the Xperia Z1 and all members of the Z5 family, including the Compact, share a common new exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that Sony's vision was to go a step beyond the symmetry of its previous devices. The new design language takes the concept of uniformity to a whole new level. The Z5 Compact is not only symmetrical, it looks almost identical from every angle - no more accents on curves or groves, no more obvious grills, everything is tucked away to create a minimalistic exterior as if the phone has been machined out of a single uniform block.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some people are sure to find the new understated looks boring, but it is quite charming in its simplicity. Perhaps even more so when looking at the small, by today's standards, Z5 Compact - packing a lot of power in a quaint and simple shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z5 Compact measures 127 x 65 x 8.9 mm, which is just a tad thicker than the Z3 Compact, but we could hardly tell the difference, which was perhaps the desired effect. In terms of weight, however, the new Compact tips the scale at 138 grams, which is a good 10 grams more than the Z3 Compact, bringing it closer to the ranks of its full-sized sibling - the Z5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This difference might be noticeable, but it is far from problematic. The Z3 Compact handles great and its small size allows for a tight grip and excellent one hand control. As already mentioned, the Z5 Compact is more or less a scaled-down version of the Z5 in every sense of the word - design and hardware. However, despite being part of the premium lineup, the Z5 Compact doesn't use metal for the frame, but rather a polycarbonate plastic. This could be the reason for one of the subtle differences in appearance, namely that the Z5 looks to has differently coated corners, while its little sibling offers a seamless finish across the edges. The former might have some durability advantages, but the latter is arguably far better looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the back on the Z5 Compact is also made of frosted glass (another way of saying matte glass) and Sony has really got the most out of the available materials. The body feels nice to the touch and the finish does not look cheap in any way. The handset comes in two classic colors - white and black, as well as two additional more vibrant options - yellow and red.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z5 Compact is undoubtedly based on the bigger Z5, but perhaps the most notable change in hardware it brings is the smaller 4.6-inch display. The slightly disappointing part, however, is that Sony has retained the same 720p resolution from the Z3 Compact. A 1080p panel would have definitely provided a bigger upgrade incentive over its predecessor, but there still seem to be at least some changes to the panel, as it now has slightly higher pixel density of 323 ppi (even higher than the iPhone 6 and 6s for all that matters).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly enough, bezels have also gotten bigger and the Z5 Compact now has a screen to body ratio of 68.9%, instead of the 70.6% of the Z3 Compact. But, once again, the difference is barely noticeable, especially in black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the front of the Z5 Compact has gotten a lot cleaner and decluttered. The 5.1MP front camera is off to the far left and is void of any rings or color accents, so it can blend in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can really tell that Sony is making an extra effort to bring a new minimalistic feel to the Z5 Compact. This design language also extends to the earpiece grill, which is now almost invisible. So is the symmetrical bottom speaker grill and it is actually the only thing found beneath the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going around the device, we find the left side almost empty. The SIM card and MicroSD slot are hidden under a tightly sealed flap. It does a splendid job of water-sealing the sensitive components, but does have a grove near the bottom that stands out on the otherwise flush side. It does, however, aid greatly in opening the cover, which is at least some conciliation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only two other details on the left frame of the Z5 Compact. First, there is a machined premium looking Xperia insignia near the top - definitely a nice accent. The second, however is a quite obvious lanyard eyelet. It is a major eye-sore, as for some reason Sony has decided to make it a deep cavern that extends well inside the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side is a little bit more crowded. It houses the silver power button, which also tends to stick out, especially on dark grey review unit we received a bit later (not pictured).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the lanyard eyelet on the opposite side, however, this looks to be intentional and it does make quite a lot of sense to leave at least one instantly-recognizable detail on a device that can otherwise be instinctively grabbed in any orientation. The embedded fingerprint reader might also have something to do with the color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it is quite a lot harder to justify the volume rocker position. Instead of being above the power button, Sony has decided to place the control underneath it. This is a common trait for the entire Z5 family and is arguably quite inconvenient. And before you flame us in the comment section, we are aware that the Z3 Compact has a similar layout, but the rocker was positioned a bit higher, making it easier to press with your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Near the bottom, there is a very thin and almost unnoticeable shutter button. It makes taking photos all that more convenient, especially underwater where the capacitive touchscreen might play tricks on you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed on the top of the device, in the right corner. Next to it is the secondary noise-canceling microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side of the Z5 Compact is relatively bare as well. It houses the microUSB port, which thanks to Sony's additional waterproof coating no longer needs a cover flap. The only other thing on the bottom is the main microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back of the Z5 Compact, we find a matte glass panel, complete with an exquisite frosted finish and thankfully not the type that would be easily covered in fingerprints. The only controls found here are the new 23MP camera, just like the one on the Z5 and a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, on the back there is both Sony and Xperia branding, as well as the traditional tiny NFC logo as this is where the NFC contact area is located.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Display size has always been a big part of the Compact series and its allure, but definitely not in the conventional "the bigger, the better" way. As already mentioned, loyal fans of the Compact line and especially the Z3 Compact value it as a representative of a rare breed of small and pocket-friendly devices with powerful hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As such, it is great that Sony has realized the need to retain the phone's small footprint and consequently, its sub 5-inch display, though we gotta tell you that we would say the perceptions have been on the move this past year and now a 5-incher can easily pass as a compact device in a flagship duo. Then again, that may have put it way too close to the Xperia Z5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Xperia Z5 Compact is 4.6 inches in diagonal and with the same 720 x 1280 pixel resolution as a year ago. It is also the same IPS LCD variety, but that is not necessarily a bad thing, especially considering the name length of all the tech Sony has reportedly put inside - things such as Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2, Triluminos technology and X-Reality engine for mobile come to mind (and being able to quote those on the top of our heads can't be a healthy thing for sure).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, we would have appreciated a higher resolution screen, especially considering that more budget-friendly phones are rocking FullHD panels nowadays. The size of the screen could have also used some improvement, or rather its proportions relative to the bezels, which seem to be bigger compared to those of the Z3 Compact (68.9% screen to body ratio, instead of 70.65). But that may be us just nitpicking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact's IPS LCD has an ordinary RGB matrix and our tests revealed that it is a pretty nice panel. The maximum display brightness is spectacularly high at 680 nits. Unlike some other Xperia phones we've seen, this brightness level is available in both auto and manual brightness modes. The display contrast ratio in both modes is very good but not excellent mostly due to the comparatively grayish blacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering without image enhancements is off to a higher extent than we're used to seeing lately (Avg deltaE 6.3 for the primary colors plus black and white). It's the whites to blame as they have a relatively high purplish tint (deltaE 14.5). Still, you would certainly have a hard time noticing the color cast without some sort of a reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color accuracy of course takes an extra hit when you turn on the screen image enhancements such as the X Reality for mobile mode. The maximum brightness however is reduced in these modes down to about 630-640 nits but the overall contrast is improved (blacks get deeper) as long as you're checking out photos or watching videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, display colors are a matter of personal taste and perception so if you don't need calibrated color output, you will probably be quite happy with the default settings of the Xperia Z5 Compact display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fine tune the display color rendering to an extent as Sony gives you fine grain sliders for adjusting the Red, Green and Blue channel, but the UI is far from user friendly and unlikely to produce any serious results without a reference point sitting side by side with the display. Even worse, as soon as you start fiddling with those sliders, the maximum brightness will take a hit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z5 Compact battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is powered by a 2700 mAh battery, sealed-in, as expected. That is just a tad less than the Z5 at 2900 mAh, but still poses an upgrade over the Z3 Compact, with its 2600 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the phone offers excellent battery performance with a total endurance rating of 86 hours, but sadly, if we measure it by the high standards set by its predecessor and its whopping 101 hours, it is not nearly as impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it is a nice and solid performance and well above average too. It means that the Z5 Compact should be more than happy to facilitate two days of average use, or at least our understanding of it - one hour of browsing, video playback and calls a day, respectively and the rest - standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Such usage pattern is of course entirely artificial, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were particularly impressed with the 28 hours of talk time the Z5 Compact managed to score. The web browsing and video playback performance are also solid, but if you are a heavy talker, it is worth noting that the small phone excels in this department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if the aforementioned usage scenario, just doesn't fit your bill, you can easily hop on to our battery life chart and adjust the pattern to your liking for an even more comprehensive comparison.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact comes only in a single SIM variant, which was also the case with its predecessor. Perhaps, Sony could have spiced things up in this generation with a dual-SIM offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE/HSDPA support. LTE is enabled and Sony has multiple regional models to make sure the Xperia Z5 Compact will work with the most widespread 4G networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity features dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.1 with A2DP. Satellite navigation is also a given, with additional A-GPS and GLONASS or Beidou (market dependent) support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Compact also has an FM radio with RDS. The phone doesn't offer an IR port, but it does come with NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections and now, thanks to special coating, it no longer needs to be covered by a flap. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over the USB cable. USB host functionality is present, but requires a little more work than simply plugging in a device. There is a special menu under Xperia Connectivity in the setting that allows you to "discover" a plugged USB device. It still works as expected, but it requires some extra legwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being part of the premium "Z" line has a few other benefits, like MHL 3 TV-out support. You can also output your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol or Sony's Xperia Connectivity Throw option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also lets you share your media over DLNA by creating a media server, as well as connect to a PlayStation DUALSHOCK 3 (or 4) wireless controller</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Lollipop with a pinch of Xperia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After a slightly hesitant transition into Android Lollipop, Sony is now fairly comfortable with the new platform and is spreading it across as many devices possible. We are happy to report that the Z5 Compact comes with Android Lollipop right out-of-the-box and, even better, it is running the up to date 5.1.1 version. It is mostly identical to its predecessor in terms of user interface, but there are a few notable changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the launcher goes, Sony has gone to great lengths to preserve its signature look and feel. If you are transitioning from a KitKat Xperia, you will instantly feel that almost everything is right where you remember, just with a fresher material-design look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This even extends to the bundled applications. Most of them are also practically untouched as far as navigation and UX goes, but now employ all the extra visual eye-candy of Android Lollipop. This kind of transition really takes effort and is definitely worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has undergone some changes with Android 5.0. There are no more lockscreen widgets available, apart, of course, from a selection of clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multiple panes have been removed as well. There are still quick shortcuts to launch the dialer and camera, which are now at the bottom left and right corners, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock and in the Z5 Compact even finger print, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five homescreen panels by default and you can set any of them as your primary one. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme. You can also choose which icons will be visible on the status bar, and which should remain hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area uses the standard Lollipop-style pull-down effect with multiple levels. Quick settings are on the top and notifications on the bottom. The aforementioned can be accessed by swiping from the top twice, but Sony has also preserved its two-finger swipe gesture, which extends the full shade in one stroke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles are customizable and you can choose between a total of 13 and have up to 9 of them visible. Their order can be adjusted manually, or you can leave that to Lollipop, which will automatically rearrange them according to frequency of use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps in various ways. However, in this new version of the launcher the signature left swipe-out menu is gone. Instead it is replaced by a small drop-down menu on the right and the search bar is at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Compact uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between the recently opened apps, as well as terminate any of them with a side-swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia Z5 Compact and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of small apps really tends to differ from one Sony to another for some reason and on our unit we found a default set of eight of those available: Active Clip, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Timer, Touch Block, Music, Bookmarks, Gmail. The latter two seem to come courtesy of the Chrome and Gmail apps presumably through implementing some special interface, but oddly enough they don't appear on all Xperia's with the corresponding apps installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, you can't disable the small apps entirely and will always have them cramming your recent apps whether you use them or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Don't get fooled by the Z5 Compact's small size. It might be compact, but it is part of the prestigious "Z" family nonetheless. Consequently, it packs some beastly silicon under the hood, namely, the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810, backed up with 2GB of RAM. That means a total of eight cores, four Cortex-A53 units clocked at 1.5 GHz and the other four Cortex-A57 at 2.0 GHz. Graphics are also well taken care of by the Adreno 430. Furthermore, given its native resolution of only 720p, the Z5 Compact should offer some serious pixel-pushing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we already mentioned, the Z5 Compact is more or less in a league of its own. Digging through the phone finder we were really hard-pressed to find many other offers with such powerful hardware and a display smaller than 5.0 inches. Of course, we can't fail to mention the iPhone 6 and 6s but if you are looking for a good Android phone that doesn't adhere to today's huge-display fads, you aren't exactly spoiled for choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, it seems that Sony currently has somewhat of a monopoly on the niche, as the closest viable candidates we could find include the Xperia Z3 Compact, which we already mentioned on several occasions and, interestingly enough, the new Xperia M5. Don't be fooled by the latter's "M"-line affiliation. The M5 is actually more of a toned-down flagship than anything else and runs on the impressive MediaTek Helio X10. However, Sony is still having some issues with this new MediaTek adoption and the Xperia M5 seems to have a lot of untapped potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other candidates we picked out with roughly the same screen real estate include two offers by Huawei - the P8 lite and the Honor 6, as well as another two by Xiaomi - the Mi 4 and Mi 4c. However, they aren't nearly as powerful as the Z5 Compact, at least on paper that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just to give you a proper perspective on how well the Z5 Compact is utilizing its Snapdragon 810 SoC, we decided to pit it against a few other popular devices that use the same silicon, despite generally being quite a bit larger. These include the HTC One M9, ZTE Nubia Z9, LG G Flex 2 and the OnePlus 2. We also threw in some closely equipped candidates, like the LG G4 and the Lenovo Vibe X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, the Z5 Compact does cost a pretty penny, so we decided to compare it with other devices you can pick up at a similar price point. It so happens that the Galaxy S5 meets the bill, so do the Nexus 6, Asus Zenfone 2 and surprisingly enough, even the new Moto X Pure Edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3 and this is where the eight cores really get to shine. We can happily report that the Z5 Compact is performing up to par with other Snapdragon 810 devices. It fact, Sony seem to have done a truly terrific job in utilizing the raw CPU power to the fullest extent. The bigger Z5 does squeeze a little more power out of the chip, but it's not a major difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an interesting observation to be made here, pertaining to the Xperia M5. Like we already mentioned, despite being a mid-range phone by design, its MediaTek Helio X10 SoC definitely holds its own and scores only a couple of hundred points below the Z5 Compact. If it is raw computational power you are after, then the latter might be a perfectly viable choice and it does come with a lower price tag than the Z5 Compact. However, the weaker GPU does take its toll in most of the other tests, so there is a definite tradeoff in making the more economical choice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. Surprisingly, the Z5 Compact blew all of the competition out of the water. It seems that Sony has invested in some quicker chips and now reaps the benefits with a whopping lead over its competitors, be it Snapdragon 810-based or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did also manage to run Antutu on our pre-production Xperia Z5 unit to see how well the Z5 Compact compares to its bigger brother. Taking the smaller screen resolution into account, as expected, it actually turned out that the Compact is comes out on top, as far as synthetic benchmarks are concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the aforementioned difference between the Z5 Compact and M5 is a lot more obvious this time around. The Z5 Compact is a true flagship, no doubt about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. Once again, the Z5 Compact really shines, especially in the single-core department. Multi-tasking, however, seems to be a bit lacking, but it is nothing serious, nor is translatable to real life performance. Our experience with the unit showed fluent performance with even the most liberal usage pattern.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to pure graphics tests and namely GFX Bench. Despite its slam size, the Z5 Compact packs the very same Snapdragon 810 chip its bigger sibling has and it performs accordingly. As anticipated, the phone simply breezes through the graphics test thanks to the powerful Adreno 430 GPU. This is especially true in the on-screen tests, where the lower HD resolution puts a lot less strain on the chipset and allows for a lot higher frame rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is especially evident in the Open GL ES 3.1 test, which generally produces frame rates that are barely usable for practical purposes, such as gaming. However, with a 720p resolution things look quite different and the Z5 Compact seems to be more than happy to facilitate this new age of mobile graphics. However, the question of how enjoyable said games would be on a 4.6 inch screen is still open for debate.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In terms of browsing, the Z5 Compact offers a splendid experience, again while keeping the limitations of the 4.6-inch display in mind. BrowserMark definitely backs up our statement, but the all JavaScript Kraken benchmark isn't quite so favorable. Naturally, we would be quick to point a finger at the built-in browser, but in the case of Sony, that is Chrome, so other forces must be at play here.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Overall, the Xperia Z5 Compact is a true powerhouse and a worthy flagship in any sense of the word. Sony has kept to its original promise for a compact unit without the need for performance compromises. This all makes the Z5 Compact an excellent device worthy to fill the shoes of the Z3 Compact, but price might be a major factor in the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While undoubtedly superior to its predecessor, the Z5 Compact does cost a pretty penny. The Z3 Compact, on the other hand, is still alive and kicking, enjoying enormous popularity among fans and not really that far-behind in terms of technology, specs or performance. The real question is whether the newer one can present enough of an incentive to upgrade, especially for about ?150 more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contacts app uses a tabbed interface, consisting of Contacts, Favorites and Groups. It is no longer bundled with the phone app, but you can still quickly jump to it from the dialer. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers a very nicely animated alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is pretty straight-forward and the Xperia offers a wide variety of additional fields you can append to your acquaintances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is also available, the quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact was able to hold onto signal very well. Calls remained uninterrupted and the sound quality was okay. Voices came out loud enough. Clarity was also quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports smart dialing, so you can seamlessly search for a number or a name using the corresponding keypad buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise cancelation system is also pulling its own weight ensuring pretty good background noise suppression, as reported by the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact loudspeaker is fairly loud and scored an Average mark in our loudspeaker test. The score was achieved with Sony's Clear Audio optimization turned off, as it does take away some of the loudness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have definitely seen louder devices, but let's not forget that the Z5 Compact does have stereo speakers, ideally positioned at on the front of the device, hidden away near the top and bottom edges under almost invisible grills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This helps for a much more immersive multimedia experience, be it for watching videos, playing games or listening to music and most phones with stereo speakers are hardly chart toppers in terms of loudness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging hasn't really changed and is the same familiar Xperia experience (yeah it does sound weird), but now with a prettier Material design interface. Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can not only sync with multiple Google accounts, but now has the ability to pull messages form ant POP or IMAP server. This does render the default messenger somewhat obsolete, but it still has its place if you want to keep your work communication completely separate from Google.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia Z5 Compact offers a customizable full QWERTY keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to what Swype offers, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-hand size keyboard is available too. If enabled, it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen so it gets more comfortable for single handed text input.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Album photo gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you've read any of our previous Xperia reviews, you should be all be familiar with Sony's custom gallery Album by now. It organizes images into groups of thumbnails and sorts them by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous versions there isn't a homepage that hosts all of your albums, instead you get the same navigation drawer as the app drawer used to offer until recently. There you can find a selector of all of your online and offline albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Filters and effects are also abundant. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. The Walkman interface is based on a swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player to your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in the volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's DSEE HX, which uses an almost wizardly algorithm on compressed music files, like MP3s and restores or rather extrapolates high range sound. According to Sony, the result is near Hi-Res Audio Quality. We aren't quite sure about that, but the processing does seem to boost quality quite noticeably. Also, it only works with wired headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new entry is the media server option. When turned on it allows your phone to act like a DLNA server, presenting its multimedia (music, photos and videos) to other DLNA clients in your network - really nifty. Also, you might notice that there is now Spotify integration inside the Walkman app, it can be enabled or disabled inside the settings menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's also an FM radio tuner with RDS. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook. The interface is very intuitive and complete with stunning animations. Possibly one of the best FM radio apps out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you would need to have your headset plugged in for the FM radio to pick up any signal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Movies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast. As for individual episodes of series, the service is still dodgy, but you might get lucky and find the info you are looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Movies also minimized your current clip and leaves it in a small window in your bottom right corner when you back out into the menu, just like the YouTube app. This is really convenient and lets you quickly return back to your content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z5 Compact is more than powerful enough to breeze through 1080p videos. It had issues with the AC-3 audio codec and failed to load sound in videos carrying it but that's mostly normal for smartphones these days. MKV movies went through, but without sound because of their AC-3 audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player comes with subtitle support by default, the only requirement is both file names (video and subtitles) to be identical.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact did a very good job in the first part of our audio quality test, where it's connected to an active external amplifier. The scores it got were great top to bottom but it only matched them with an average volume level so we can't quite call it perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones harm the stereo crosstalk but it remained decent, but it also introduced a bit of frequency response deviation and brought the volume down a notch. Not too bad of a showing, but certainly not one worth bragging about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Promising 23MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No proper modern day flagship could be truly complete without a powerful camera and the Z5 Compact definitely makes no exception. As part of the new "Z" lineup the small handset has been blessed with the very same 23MP camera as the Z5 and even the Z5 Premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, since the Z5 Compact utilizes the exact same camera plus chipset and hence ISP combination, the only logical conclusion is that the tiny smartphone should be just as good in this department as its bigger brother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The said camera has very good white balance and color rendering, a good flash with pleasant white balance, good detail preservation regardless of light conditions. On the other hand, artifacts are visible in uniform areas such as the blue skies and the photos have visible corner softness. Also noise in low-light situations was a bit more than we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony might be marketing the new camera as simply a 23MP one, paired with an f/2.0 24mm-equivalent wide-angle lens, but there is actually a lot more going on behind the scenes. The sensor it uses, said to be the Sony IMX300 is actually what is known as a multi-aspect sensor and in reality has quite a bit more pixels - around 25MP to be exact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony doesn't market this officially and instead cited the 23MP (well, actually about 22.85MP) resolution or 5520 x 4140 pixels that the phone does in 4:3 mode. Meanwhile, however, the 16:9 aspect ratio mode yields images measuring 5,984 x 3,366 pixels (20.14MP). What you'll notice, is that the 16:9 shots have a higher horizontal resolution than the 4:3 ones, hence they're not cropped from 4:3 as usual, but instead use a different part of a larger sensor. This might not sound like much, but you do actually get comparable resolutions in both aspects, which is nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The impressive hardware, in combination with the capable Snapdragon 810 chip makes it possible to shoot UHD 2160p videos at 30fps with the main camera and up to 1080p@30fps with the front-facing one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a dedicated two-stage shutter button, which makes precise focus a whole lot easier. It is a shame that there is no dual-tone flash, but just a plain single LED one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera viewfinder is the usual affair, nothing has changed on Android Lollipop, although the latest app update did move a few things around, most notable HDR, which is no longer hidden away in the setting. Perhaps there are other changes under the hood, but we are yet to fully experience it in the future, as the app is not in its final state yet even though our review unit runs final firmware. Back at the announcement of the Z5 series, Sonny promised an updated camera app with a new UI, which it is yet to deliver even now that the phones have already hit the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Superior Auto mode stills and videos share the viewfinder and you can snap a photo or shoot a video without changing modes beforehand. While this is convenient, framing your videos correctly is nearly impossible as the two have different fields of view and you only get to see the actual framing only once you've started recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Manual mode you can switch between stills and video capture so that you can see the framing of your images and videos correctly (each with its own field of view) before you've pressed the shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a dedicated video mode, with a proper viewfinder with manual control, which is nice to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode is what we've already seen in other Xperia phones. There are no settings you can change, everything here is done automagically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia Z5 Compact offers several other interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama but, it's not really all that great. Stitching is not horrible, but till clearly visible. Resolve detail, on the other hand, is surprisingly poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs real-life visual cues in the scene to track your motion). Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's new 23MP sensor shows great promise. But regardless of how powerful the hardware is, the camera experience is still very dependent on software processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony does have some spotty reputation in this department with certain recurring issues like poor edge-to-edge sharpness and a lot of noise under less than favorable lighting. Looking at the samples form the Z5 Compact we sadly see many of these issues yet again - some shots came out quite blurry and a lot of detail seems to have this watercolor like look, which is usually a result of poor noise reduction algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Focusing also had its ups and downs, and at times failed to lock at our test subject so, overall, in its current state the Z5 Compact doesn't exactly live up to the promise of a glorious camera experience. The key word here, however, seems to be the current state. Like we already mentioned, Sony seems to be amidst a camera software update and we might see those changed for the better down the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are actually quite inclined to blame the software for a lot of the imperfections at this point, as it did also exhibit a few odd bugs while shooting, like endless focus hunting and absurdly short exposure times. Furthermore, we have to admit that shooting conditions were less than ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z5 Compact's camera also has a lot of redeeming factors going for it, like nice and accurate color representation, a good dynamic range and last, but not least, very fast auto-focus even if not terribly accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples form the 23MP camera:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On another positive note, the fast hardware has made the camera app nice and responsive and Sony's legendary Superior Auto mode seems to have gotten better as well. It still has its hiccups and can sometimes toggle to an odd shooting mode, but it generally manages to produce far better photos than a zero-config manual approach. Here are some samples taken with Superior Auto on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Superior Auto would occasionally activate the HDR mode, if you really want to force it, you'd have to go to Manual mode and select Backlight Correction (HDR). Sony has now moved said toggle to a more convenient location, next to the White balance controls, so you no longer need to browse setting to reach it. However, it is also worth noting that the HDR effect itself looks quite toned down, especially compared to other recent Sony models, like the Xperia M5. Shooting in manual mode with and without HDR barely makes a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few HDR samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tested how well the Z5 Compact performs up close and personal. Superior Auto does a perfectly decent job of sensing our intentions and toggling macro mode, but for some reason, focus didn't work particularly well and completely failed in as we got closer for some macro shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, we also tested out the 5.1MP front-facing camera. Photos came out with nice colors and a lot of detail, as one would expect. Here are a couple of samples at slightly different lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still camera comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've uploaded the full resolution (23MP) photos to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia Z5 Compact in our photo compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a 23MP camera and powerful Snapdragon 810, the Xperia Z5 Compact has all the required prerequisites to do 4K and should also do a pretty good job of it. It definitely lives up to those expectations, producing pretty impressive results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder shares the same UI as the still camera, unless you go into manual mode. In manual mode you can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the Xperia Z5 Compact features digital image stabilization - SteadyShot, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilization systems work). Also, it takes a toll on the quality. However, the Z5 Compact does show major improvements in this area - quality isn't severely affected and the stabilization works surprisingly well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way if the option is turned on. One notable absence in the Z5 Compact's new camera app is HDR mode in video. Hopefully, it will reappear with a future update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z5 Compact shoots truly gorgeous 4K videos with a resolution of 3840 x 2176 pixels and a steady framerate of 30 fps. The bitrate is also quite impressive at 54 to 55 Mbps, coupled with a 48 kHz audio sampling rate, captured in stereo, of course. Resolve detail is really impressive. Overall, the Z5 Compact offers 4K video fit for a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another small, but quite convenient feature worth noting. On the Z5 Compact you can toggle between the new and improved H.265 video codec or the older H.264 one. The former is undoubtedly superior in every way, but support is still spotty, YouTube, for example, still doesn't accept it, so having a compatibility option is a welcome sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto focus, however, was far from docile and in typical Sony fashion, the phone hunted for focus while video recording quite a bit. Setting the autofocus to a single focus per video remedies the issue entirely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Z5 Compact can also do 1080p videos as well and does a pretty impressive job of it. Furthermore, there is even a 60fps option that also produces impressive results, smoothing out the motion. Below are to 1080p samples at 30fps and 60fps, as well as a 4K you can check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the untouched video samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p@30fps (10s, 23MB) 1080p@60fps (10s, 37MB) 4K@30fps (10s, 69MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video camera comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact captures gorgeous 4K videos. It managed to resolve a lot of detail in our resolution chart test and under good light conditions, but there is quite a bit of noise and artefacts when shooting in low-light rooms.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z5 Compact also features the Office Suite 8, which allows for creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and File Manager apps are available on board the device by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife app comes pre-installed too. It is a service similar to Samsung's My Magazine and HTC One's Blinkfeed. The interface is clean and simple yet beautiful, and there are lots of preloaded feeds. You can add your own RSS links too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's New app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there are no known Wi-Fi networks in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't fail to mention Sony's upgraded security features, namely the fingerprint reader, ushered with the Z5 family. Embedding the hardware inside the power bottom is arguably the most convenient implementation of the technology to date and Sony's take works pretty good. It is quick and accurate, you can really simply set it up and then forget it is there, which is the ultimate goal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Lounge is a sort of custom-tailored deal and promotion aggregator. It gives users the opportunity to participate in various Sony promotions and win prizes. Another interesting little feature is the Movie Creator. Its name is pretty much says it all. It has a really nifty "Best Moments" feature that endeavors to create a highlights-only version form a given video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Compact is also fully equipped as a PlayStation sidekick with access to the PS Network, store and even remote connection to your console and access to its multimedia - movies and music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty is Sony's Lifelog app. It is an all-in-one hub for tracking your activity, daily routine, sleep cycle and more. Generally, if it involves moving, Lifelog endeavors to log it. It is a splendid addition and works pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and Navigation are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in GPS receiver (now complete with GLONASS support). Offline maps are available, again, since the last update, so you can save some data traffic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z5 Compact key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Compact has superb build-quality. The exposed microUSB port is a lot more convenient than Sony's previous covered solution, but the volume keys is somewhat oddly positioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display offers superb maximum levels of brightness and pretty good contrast. The resolution is still only 720p, same as last year's generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side-mounted fingerprint reader is really convenient, fast and reliable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is solid with a really respectable 86 hours of endurance rating. However it falls short of the 101 hour rating the Z3 Compact got in our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Based on Android 5.0, the Xperia launcher runs quite nicely on the Z5 Compact and is packed with several interesting features. The phone is definitely not lacking on the software side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance-wise, the Xperia Z5 Compact is a true powerhouse, equipped with Qualcomm's top-of-the-line Snapdragon 810 SoC. The low screen resolution combined with the high-end GPU enables one of the most impressive OpenGL ES 3.1 frame rates we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker setup on the Z5 Compact is only average in terms of loudness, but this is actually ok for a device with stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera setup on the Z5 Compact offers accurate colors and good dynamic range, but sadly samples were still plagued by typical Sony problems - poor edge to edge sharpness and a lot of low-light noise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its diminutive physical size, the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact has some big shoes to fill and a lot of expectations to live up to. Albeit a little aging now, the Z3 Compact is still a solid device, with a very select market of its own and a group of fans eager for a follow-up to their beloved small, yet powerful handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a lot of ways, the Z5 Compact meets the bill. It improves its predecessor in almost every way except perhaps battery life. Most-importantly, it has managed to conserve and carry the series core principles of providing flagship hardware inside a compact and stylish shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hence, there are really two distinct ways of evaluating the Z5 Compact. On one hand, it is a beautiful device through and through with top notch performance, design and build quality and it does fill an ever-growing void of powerful sub-5.0-inch devices. But, on the other hand, it is not alone in this niche, as the Z3 Compact is still a solid choice. Furthermore, it is now more tantalizing than even thanks to its continuously falling price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end of the day it all comes down to whether the Z5 Compact brings enough improvements to the table to justify its ?150 or so price difference and more often than not, that depends on your personal needs and opinion. Here is a quick rundown of our test findings on the device:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finding adequate competitors to the Z5 Compact is no easy task. As already mentioned, the primary allure of the device is its compact size, combined with flagship-grade hardware and performance. It might sound simple enough, but, as it turns out, there are only few smartphones nowadays that fit the bill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony seems to have somewhat of a monopoly in the compact flagship niche. We've already discussed the Z3 Compact on several occasion throughout the review and it is, indeed, a pretty natural comparison to make. When you get down to it, the Z3 Compact has the same footprint and display, hardware that is still quite capable (Snapdragon 801 plus 2GB of RAM) and a pretty comparable camera experience. Other differences between the duo are quite small, but could still be enough to sway you one way or the other. Small things, like the accessible microUSB port on the Z5 compact that is no longer hidden behind a flap cover or the fingerprint reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Longer software support might also count in favor of the newer model, but Sony has already proven quite diligent in updating its legacy flagships, so perhaps that is less of a concern in the particular case. As for the rest of the story, it is straightforward - if you opt for the shiny Z5, it will cost you about ?150 more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also another viable Sony option if you don't mind a slightly bigger 5.0-inch screen, some reductions in performance and the absence of a few "Z" series exclusive features. It is called the Xperia M5 and it brings a whole new level of power and functionality to the company's mid-range lineup. More notable features include FullHD screen resolution, a snappy MediaTek Helio X10 SoC, 3GB of RAM and an impressive camera setup of 21.2MP plus 13MP camera. Sadly, the M5 has limited international availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that can't really be your only options for a small and powerful smartphone right now, can it? Well, it is slim pickings. If we stretch the maximum size out to 5.0 inches, while still keeping in mind the requirement for a powerful chipset, there are a few other options to be mentioned. The Samsung Galaxy Alpha is a primary candidate. It is now about a year old, but it does offer a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED display, a powerful Exynos 5 Octa 5430 SoC and 2GB of RAM. Also worth checking out are the Xiaomi's Mi 4i and its variant, the Mi 4c, both sitting at 5.0-inches, with the former running on a Snapdragon 615 and the latter - using a Snapdragon 808.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite and Honor 6 are also worth mentioning. They both have 5.0-inch displays and are fairly recent, but also utilize the OEM's own custom HiSilicon Kirin chipsets, which suffer from a comparatively low graphics performance should that matter to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit that the Z5 Compact vs. Z3 Compact dilemma is definitely a tough one and it is hard to weigh in on it one way or the other. Even though this is the current market situation the phone enters in, we really need to be objective and evaluate the Z5 Compact as a 2015 flagship offer. When we look at things from this perspective, the Z5 Compact really shines as an all-around splendid smartphone and would hardly allow to be dwarfed by any of the bigger boys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Granted, it does have its small quirks, but it would undoubtedly deliver on its main promise and that is catering to those who would still appreciate a small, yet powerful Android device in the sprawling smartphone realm. It is a small phone with big ambitions and while it may be trying too hard at times, being an overachiever is not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to phone personalities.</paragraph>
