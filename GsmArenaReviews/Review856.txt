			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is official - and it's not what we expected. Rumors got a few details right, but not the whole picture, obviously. After so many updates and sequels to the S4, it's perhaps not all that surprising that the S5 feels like a small step forward.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S5 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The screen grew up only a bit and it kept the 1080p resolution rather than going to QHD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does, however, record UHD video - Samsung's initial information was for 1080p, but we can now confirm it's really 4K UHD (2160p).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung does maintain the clockspeed advantage with a rare Snapdragon 800 chipset and while the fingerprint scanner was no surprise, the heart rate monitor certainly is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz was a bit of a surprise too. We got pumped up for a brand new flat version of Samsung's custom UI, but the reality is closer to what we saw on the new Galaxy Pro tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is a new iteration of Samsung's leather-like plastic, with what looks like perforated holes. It only looks like it though, the Galaxy S5 is IP67 certified - we don't expect to see a Galaxy S5 Active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we said, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is in part what we expected and a bit of a surprise. What is it though that sets it apart from the Galaxy S4 Advance with the leather back?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S5 hands-on: hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is nearly 6mm taller and 3mm wider than the S4, it's even a tad thicker. It has also put on 15g of weight. Those values seem too high for a mere 0.1" increment in screen size, but we suspect water-proofing the device took its toll on the bezels (think of Xperia Z1's bezels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of design, the Galaxy S5 looks more rectangular - closer to the Note 3 than the Galaxy S4. Samsung kept the hardware buttons below the screen, only replacing the Menu key with the App Switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the Home button now contains a fingerprint scanner, which will be used for securing the phone but apps can also use it to provide secure verification for their services. You need to swipe your finger over the scanner (not just hold it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's really the back that has changed the most. The plastic still has a leathery texture, but goes after the perforated leather look and there's no stitching. This makes it look more like a plastic back rather than a leather imitation, but the material still feels good to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the new 16MP camera with no optical image stabilization and 2160p video capture. Samsung claims the Phase Detection Auto Focus tech is the fastest on a phone, but we'll have to test it for ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right under the camera is the flash with two odd looking sensors for heart rate monitor, which is a first on a smartphone. With the S5, Samsung is putting an even stronger emphasis on a fit lifestyle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is a 1080p Super AMOLED unit that has grown a bit since the last generation, but the difference in surface area is less than 5%. Samsung enabled dynamic adjustments to the screen based on ambient light, but the poor lighting at the event masked any difference that could have made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The silvery plastic that encircles the sides of the phone is still in place and here you can see the usual suspects, including an IR blaster at the top. Samsung has moved to microUSB 3.0, just like on the Note 3. The port is covered under a flap to prevent water damage, while the 3.5mm audio jack on top is left uncovered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is removable as usual. Below it is a 2,800mAh battery (also removable) and a microSD card slot to supplement the 16/32GB built-in storage. The slots supports the new 128GB microSD cards, so you won't run out of storage any time soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung will offer more color options out of the gate - the standard Black and White models, a Blue one (a much brighter blue than the original S4 Arctic Blue) and a Copper version (which we suspect will become better known as "gold"). Note that the color versions are region dependent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy S5 software: new TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The teasers from Samsung lead people to believe that TouchWiz on the Galaxy S5 will have a flat, Holo-like design. The reality is much closer to what TouchWiz is today - some elements have indeed gotten flatter, like the notification area, but we already saw that on the Galaxy Pro tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video demo to get a taste of TouchWiz. The Settings screen especially, with its circular icons is more what we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the Settings menu, the lock and home screens look very much like they used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has gotten a little more cluttered with S Finder and Quick Connect shortcuts, though hopefully those can be disabled just like the brightness slider. My Magazine is on board, which has become a TouchWiz staple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here's a quick look at the new camera interface - several commonly used features are now immediately accessible, so you don't have to dig in the Mode or Settings menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy S5 camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 features a 16MP camera with a 16:9 sensor. That's right, you get full resolution 16MP samples if you shoot in 16:9 (the Galaxy S4 and most other phones crop and lose resolution when making widescreen shots).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also confirmed that the sensor itself is bigger than what was in the Galaxy S4 camera, but we have no exact size yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to snap several samples with the Galaxy S5, here are three Normal mode shots. The lighting at the venue wasn't particularly favorable, but given the circumstances, the Samsung Galaxy S5 did a pretty solid job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung was particularly proud about the progress the Galaxy S5 makes when it comes to HDR photos, or as the Koreans call those - Rich tone photos. Check out how much extra dynamic range the Galaxy S5 is able to squeeze compared to the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an HDR sample we captured:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the internal memory of the S5 unit we found these photos too, they are paired Normal mode and HDR mode:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: the Galaxy S5 records 4K UHD video, despite early information to the contrary. That's 3840 x 2160 video at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've recorded a couple of short videos to demonstrate the UHD recording capabilities of the S5. Note that you'll need a relatively beefy computer to play 4K at its native resolution (YouTube will play a lower resolution by default, don't forget to change to UHD!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had time to run a few benchmarks and things went pretty much as expected - the Snapdragon 800 chipset is a great performer, especially at this clock speed. It topped most benchmarks we threw at it, though the Snapdragon 801 in the Xperia Z2 gave it a run for its money in 3D benchmarks (the 801 has a higher GPU clock speed compared to the 800).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tizen OS was thrown into the fray at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona right away as Samsung announced the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo smartwatches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo are pretty similar devices but the Neo omits the 2MP camera, for a reduced weight of 55g. The Gear 2 will weigh 68g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two Tizen-powered smartwatches were unveiled at a pretty classy presentation. The Gear 2 will come in Charcoal Black, Gold Brown and Wild Orange, while the Neo will skip the Gold Brown for Mocha Grey.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo come with exchangeable straps in varying colors - both Samsung-made wrist straps and third-party options will be available. The smartwatch bodies themselves available in a number of paint jobs, there's plenty of potential for mixing and matching. The straps have a nice rubber texture feel to them, while the watch itself fits nicely on the wrist. The wrist strap has been stripped of controls - the camera on the Gear 2 has been moved to the body, as have the IR blaster and the microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo have a 300mAh battery (as opposed to the 315mAh unit on the Galaxy Gear) and promise 2 - 3 days of standby time with regular usage, up to 6 days of if used sparingly. The touchscreen is the same 1.63" AMOLED unit while the dual-core processor has seen a slight bump in clockspeed from 800MHz to 1GHz. There's 512MB of RAM and 4 gigs of internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both watches are IP67-certified for dust and water resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year's Gear lineup will feature a heart-rate monitor and a fitness app, while the IR port will allow remote control of various appliances. There will also be a music player on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartwatches are less dependent on their smartphone counterparts. With things like a built-in music player and a stand-alone fitness app, users can go about their exercise routine without carrying a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is our hands-on video of the Gear 2 smartwatch:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartwatches will be coming this April but still no word on pricing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear Fit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In addition to the Galaxy Gear 2 duo of smartwatches, Samsung also unveiled a strictly fitness oriented wristband, called simply the Gear Fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gear Fit features a 1.84" curved Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 432 x 128 pixels. It may not sound like much, but the pixel density is quite high at 244 pixels per inch. The colors really pop, as you'd expect from a Super AMOLED display and the contrast is great. We're also happy to report that the viewing angles are also great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the Gear Fit's cornerstone features is its heart rate monitor. It is mounted on the back of the wristband and after a short adjusting displays your heart rate. It works seamlessly and will be helpful for those who want to keep an eye on their vitals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit packs a 210mAh battery, which may not sound like much, but it's capable of a maximum usage time of 7 days. With a standard usage, Samsung says the Fit's battery will manage 3-4 days, and that's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the Fit also reside an accelerometer and a gyroscope, which will undoubtedly enable developers to come up with some really nifty apps. Bluetooth 4.0 LE handles the connection with your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the heart rate monitor at the bottom of the Fit sit the pin connectors used for charging the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of the wristband is just 27 grams and it measures 23.4 x 57.4 x 11.95mm. It's also water- and dust-resistant as it is IP67 certified. The straps are changeable and Samsung offers a variety of others for you to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running Tizen, the Fit can display notifications from your smartphones such as calls, emails, SMS messages and notifications from apps. It's also capable of controlling your music and can help you schedule new appointments. Additionally, it packs a timer and a stopwatch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Tizen prototype hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tizen did have a presence at the MWC as promised, but that was in the form of the new Galaxy Gear watches. The only Tizen-running phone we saw was a prototype device that looks a lot like a Galaxy S4. Samsung made it clear it's not an S4 and is for development purposes only, it won't be selling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the actual device, this is our first look of Tizen OS on a phone (odd, considering the OS is on version 3.0 already). The interface looks very much like Samsung's latest iteration of TouchWiz running on Android 4.4 KitKat, but simplified. We found it very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some differences - for example, widgets on the homescreen feel more like Windows Phone live tiles than Android widgets. Also, the homescreen itself has two modes - Basic and Office. Both options have two separate sets of homescreen panes for good work/personal life separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some familiar TouchWiz features like the floating mini apps are available here too. There are widgets on the homescreen, but they felt more like live tiles than Android widgets. Most of them were 1x1 though, bigger widgets were rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the device Tizen was running on, it's clear the hardware was based on the Galaxy S4. Unfortunately for Bada fans, or is it Maemo and MeeGo fans (those branches merged to form Tizen), Samsung won't be selling this device. There are no official plans to sell any Tizen phone yet.</paragraph>
