			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No breaking news here. More of a developing story. The HTC Sensation XE is a shiny new release that lets you catch up on the latest from HTC Android lineup. A luxury edition for audiophiles with some extra kick squeezed out of the CPU. Old song to a new tune, if you will. But we wouldn?t frown at the sound of it. After all, it's the sound that counts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beats Audio is a big part of the deal in the new Sensation XE. HTC have teamed up with Beats by Dr. Dre to boost the phone's credentials to audio purists. There's special sound processing on the inside and a Monster iBeats headset in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other things they tinkered with are the processor and battery. The two cores are now ticking at 1.5 GHz and the battery's been beefed up to 1730 mAh. The rest is familiar but by no means boring. The HTC Sensation is a dual-core super droid with a massive 4.3 qHD touchscreen, 8MP stills and Full HD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson did it with the Xperia arc S and Samsung must've lost count of the Galaxy S sequels. Why have one flagship when you can have two seems to be the common thinking. The XE is not a replacement of the original Sensation. It's a special edition with very specific targeting. Brand spanking new - yes! Groundbreaking - no! Worth it? Well, we're about to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build and finish are nearly identical to the original model, but for the BeatsAudio logo and red color accents. Those seem to make quite a lot of difference and to us the Sensation XE is the better looking phone. And HTC did well to make it easily recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how will the two flagships get along? This isn't going to be a rivalry we think. The Sensation XE has a very specific target and the original Sensation can only benefit from a price drop - albeit a minor one. There's a six month gap between the two. Too soon for releasing a massive upgrade but enough time for the initial excitement to wane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a sensible move from HTC to try and rekindle the love. And they did well to give the new version a unique selling feature. But is it worth the extra asking price? Always a legitimate question, this one is even more pertinent given HTC's usually steep pricing. To be fair though, the Monster headset alone pretty much offsets the premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, anyone can do their own math. Now, let's do ours. The usual set of benchmarks, audio and screen tests, and image samples will help us know the Sensation XE better. As usual though, we start with the hardware.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package - Monster Beats headset outshines everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE comes in a box that's a bit bigger than usual - the first sign you are actually getting a special edition bundle. There is the usual compact charger, a microUSB cable and some user guides. A 16GB microSD card is more than welcome - plenty of storage for a respectable music collection. And it?s a Class 4 card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then comes the real treat in the shape of an iBeats headset by Monster. The red cabling matches the color accents of the Sensation XE. The supplied set is slightly different to the regular retail version: it has a set of three chrome-plated music controls instead of a single button. The middle Play/Pause button doubles as a call key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a fancy pouch too with some spare ear tips of varying size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Sensation XE 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE has the exact same measurements as the original Sensation. At 126.1 x 65.4 x 11.3 mm, it weighs just three grams more - tipping the scales at 151 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE looks better than its predecessor. We like the color accents: the earpiece, the trim of the camera lens nest and the red-backlit capacitive controls. The finish of the rear is another point in favor. While the original Sensation did look patched up from different pieces, the XE has a single color soft rubbery finish and a piece of aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's by no means a compact handset but fortunately designed to provide a good grip. The rubbery finish and curved shape of the battery cover are of much help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although we don't have any gripes with the build quality, we wouldn't call it unibody. It's certainly made to look like one - the battery cover doesn?t just attach at the top or bottom, it rather warps the phone's body in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE comes with a familiar 4.3? Gorilla glass protected S-LCD screen. It's the same unit we met in the first Sensation. Not the best display we've seen, with middling outdoor performance and disappointing viewing angles. Blacks are not as deep as AMOLED screens go, but brightness and color rendering are good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our traditional display brightness and contrast test confirm our observations. Deep blacks are not the Sensation XE's strength and while the brightness levels are OK, the contrast ratios aren?t that impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we have the proximity and ambient light sensors to the left of the earpiece and the VGA video call camera on the right. There's a tiny status LED under the earpiece grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find four capacitive keys, also painted in red. The haptic enabled controls are well spaced and very responsive. The keys (Home, Menu, back and search) have extra functionality upon a long-press (task switcher, virtual keyboard, voice search).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sensation XE features the microUSB port and the volume rocker. The volume rocker is quite thin but comfortable enough to use. The microUSB port is also used for charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not strictly speaking a microUSB port - though it looks and works like one. It enables MHL connectivity. Plug in a MHL dongle however and the MHL port transforms into HDMI out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, there's nothing - you weren?t hoping for a shutter key, were you? We've been there with the original Sensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack and the Power/Lock key, which is easy enough to press when needed but secure against accidental taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece. There's also a small latch that lets you pop the phone out of its back cover. That's right, the phone comes out of the back cover, not the other way around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sensation XE features the 8MP camera (with a red metallic trim) and the dual-LED flash right next to it. The area around the camera protrudes slightly and the camera lens is set quite deep, giving it very good protection against scratches and fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The protruding frame around the lens also helps to keep the loudspeaker from getting muffled when you place the phone on a level surface. It's not entirely successful but the sound is still pretty clear. We should note though that the Beats Audio enhancement only works with the headset, not the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back plate has gotten rid of the different patches. The two pieces or rubbery plastic either side of the aluminum strip have the same color and texture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing hasn't changed unfortunately. The back cover houses the antennas of the HTC Sensation XE - remove the cover and the phone loses all wireless signal. The handset suffers the so-called "death grip" too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, you don?t even need a grip to weaken the reception. Just place the phone flat on the palm of your hand and the phone loses a few notches of Wi-Fi signal. In fact, touching the area around the camera and loudspeaker can reduce the Wi-Fi signal to zero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cellular antenna also has death grip issues - they're not as bad but your hands around the bottom of the device will cause the signal to weaken. It's nothing to worry about if the signal is strong enough, but in areas of poor reception it can make the difference between having and dropping the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the back cover is the microSD card slot (easily how-swappable once you open the phone) and the SIM card compartment, which is blocked by the battery. The phone comes with a complimentary Class 4 16 GB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE the battery beefed up to 1730 mAh. The Li-Ion unit is quoted at a little over 12 days of standby and over 9 hours of talk time in 2G (about 7 in 3G). In reality the phone lasted a good three days constantly connected to a Wi-Fi network, but without a SIM-card inside most of the time. We shot the typical mixture of videos and stills, ran the usual benchmarks, did quite a bit of browsing and music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XE is nearly identical to the original model - from the slightly concave shape of the Gorilla-coated qHD touchscreen to the not-quite-a-unibody design. It's a well-built phone and the styling was duly refreshed with nice accents. With a 4.3" screen, this is a big phone, but one designed to offer comfortable handling. The HTC Sensation XE comes with a good set of accessories too. The Monster iBeats headset is a major point in favor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI/Gingerbread combo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE comes with Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread and version 3.0 of the HTC Sense. Gingerbread should be familiar enough to you, so are the HTC's customizations on top of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already saw this version of HTC Sense in action on the first Sensation, but don't worry if you missed it - everything is covered here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one difference we noticed throughout the whole interface is the more saturated wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well done to HTC for the new lockscreen. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC Sensation XE comes with six different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen just shows the ring, four shortcuts, the time and the homescreen wallpaper. Then there's the Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Friend Stream widget which shows SNS updates from your friends and the Weather widget which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations. There's Stocks too - with quotes flying up or down, again, in eye-pleasing 3D. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 11 clock widgets you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you can't download new lockscreens from HTC Hub. Not yet anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the Sense homescreen. There, we meet a scroll arc at the bottom that is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with HTC proprietary Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but the customization goes deep ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and use different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetically, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There's a list layout, where two-finger alphabet scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are thirteen different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold of the Home button works too. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled on the HTC Sensation XE but it won?t work if you have removed the battery ? in that case it will do a regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool things is apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before turning the phone off, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC use some sort of Suspend or Hibernate routine as seen in regular computers to implement the fast boot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE has a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon chipset with Adreno 220 graphics beating in its chest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The higher-res screen puts it at a disadvantage though as the GPU has to push out 35% more pixels that the competition. That, and the new Snapdragon chipset still uses Scorpion cores, which are getting old and there's "only" 768MB RAM, which might show in some tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi is CPU-intensive but it's not designed for dual-cores so the older CPU architecture shows clearly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack on the other hand is based on a benchmark for supercomputers so it makes perfect use of all the cores it can get - the faster the better too. The Sensation XE strangely pushed quite disappointing results, falling behind the first Sensation a lot. This behavior continues to the NenaMark 2 graphic benchmark, our XE model scored less than the first Sensation (we checked the global NenaMark 2 charts and the results are similar).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two in-browser benchmarks managed to surprise us - the Sensation XE did quite good at the SunSpider JavaScript test, while it topped the BrowserMark charts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages between you and the given contact in a conversation layout. The third tab is a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what turns the Sensation XE into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Sensation XE. The Transfer app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart dialing and death grips<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC Sensation XE has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already covered the death grip issues of the Sensation XE, but the reception is okay most of the time. You can experience issues in areas of poor signal though, especially if you?re touching the bottom of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE knows some accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call while placing it down starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Sensation XE fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Good mark putting it somewhere in the middle among its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Sensation XE are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Sensation XE boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the 4.3? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app features several tabs that let you filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Sensation XE lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beautiful image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery has changed - it now stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC Sensation XE is very straightforward ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube. You could use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sensation XE supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor DivX/XviD support, 1080p MP4 playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery. There's no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox if you have it installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Sensation XE offers a full screen toggle (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through videos. SRS sound enhancement is also available but there?s no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general - 1080p MP4 videos were no problem. The player handled some 720p DivX or XviD videos. However, it was picky about which videos it would play and which it wouldn?t - especially when dealing with HD clips or large files. Most of the 360p XviD videos that played were choppy though. There's no MKV or subtitle support either, which was disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too ? the Sensation XE can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable. The Sensation XE needs some work in this department though, if we're to accept it as a proper portable HD video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beats Audio and HTC Enhancer presets are available in the video player too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beats Audio enhances the music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased (at least our unit had, which featured a Vodafone music shop).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dropdown at the top of the screen lets you switch between your library on the phone and DLNA media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE offers Beats Audio sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. It is available only when you plug in your Monster headphones. There are no other equalizer presets, just Beats Audio or HTC Enhancer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately you can't listen music without something "enhancing" your songs. If you don't use the Beats Audio, you'll find the HTC preset really awful. So, you either listen music with Beats Audio and headset combo, or you don?t. You can use whatever headset you like, but it just won't be the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the bar at the top of the screen that says "HTC Sensation XE" lets you play the song on another device wirelessly - either over DLNA or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on the lockscreen that lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). The card also shows the album art and name of the song and artist. You can flip the card - it's backside shows album art and track info too, but lacks music controls. That's not particularly useful but is good eye candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app ? SoundHound. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Beats audio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are not quite sure where to start with the HTC Sensation XE audio output. During our test we were surprised to find out that there was no way to turn off the audio enhancements on the phone. Even if you disable the Beats audio option, the HTC enhancements are automatically activated, so there's no way to get what's regarded as a "clean" audio output from this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while turning on certain equalizer presets are what most people prefer anyway, real audiophiles know that it's the perfectly clean, untouched audio output that makes a great music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the good news is that the rest of the readings in our test were pretty good. The HTC Sensation XE did spectacularly in the active external amplifier part of the test. It was one of the loudest smartphones we have seen (it even outdid the iPhone 4S) and achieved some excellent scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, that frequency response can in no way be interpreted as a good result. We get it that people like deep bass and everything, but why not give them the option to also turn it off?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the HTC Sensation XE performance with headphones plugged in, it's pretty good, but not quite as impressive. The volume levels drop from class-leading to above average and intermodulation distortion creeps in. Stereo crosstalk rises a bit too, but it's nothing to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall we'd give excellent mark to the Sensation XE if it wasn't for the always-on equalizer. It's up to you to judge whether that concerns you or not.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the first Sensation, the FM radio app on the Sensation XE starts and turns off a lot faster (about a second or two).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera is ok, but nothing special<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 1080p video @ 30fps. There?s a dual-LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom lever on the left. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE has touch focus and face detection; geotagging is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is enabled too which is good to have on a phone like the Sensation XE with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have the right focus is to tap and hold the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other image effects too. For example, Warp places a control point on the screen, which you can drag with your finger and see the result in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depth of field is another such effect ? it adds a radius slider besides the control point and will blur everything in the photo that falls outside the circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is a match to the previous Sensation, but this is hardly a surprise. The camera department is hardly its strongest suit - noise reduction is trying too hard at times to offset a noisy image sensor. Also contrast is generally good, but the colors often come out way off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the XE did very well in low-lighting conditions - despite the high noise levels, it kept a lot of detail. Colors were quite acceptable and its dual-LED flash was one of the strongest we've seen (as far as LED flashes go).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't need the full 8MP resolution (say you upload to Facebook, which will downsize them by default) then the results are quite acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've got a bunch of samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 8MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synthetic ISO chart clearly shows signs of over-processing. The other two charts are a good indication of how much that processing softens the image. Still, results are slightly better than the first Sensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Sensation XE in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording does not impress too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change unless you tap an area on the screen, which will cause the camera to refocus on that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in .3GP, which isn't the ideal container for HD video, especially 1080p. Videos have a decent bitrate of about 10Mbps and smooth 30fps framerate when the lighting is good. When the lights go out however, the camera drops below the 24fps threshold which led it to capture choppy videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Sensation XE camera boasts stereo audio recording awith a sampling rate of 44kHz, which is a huge difference over the sub-22kHz mono sound that, say, the LG Optimus 2X or the Samsung Galaxy S II record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved details in the Sensation XE videos is above average for a FullHD shooter, but noise reduction leaves something to be desired (it's extra destructive in the shades).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos captured by the Sensation XE are good, though we've seen better even from phones that can't shoot higher than 720p resolution. 720p videos from the XE suffer from the same framerate problem as its 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample 1080p@30fps video clip and a 720p@30fps clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience. Don't forget to click 1080p on the FullHD video sample and open the video fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the HTC Sensation XE in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 1080p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This test shows curious results - the camera seems to have potential but the low-bitrate (around 10Mbps) smears out all the fine detail, producing unsatisfactory results. Again, the same results as the first Sensation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity suffers death grips<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE has a complete connectivity set. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast dual-band 3G: 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are death grip issues though - the Wi-Fi radio is especially prone to it. It can be reduced to zero when you touch the top part of the back of the phone. We tested the issue extensively, and we?re not the only ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cell network signal is more resilient though touching the bottom of the phone might cause trouble in areas with poor reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connected media app handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? it plays media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the gallery have such functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices (default Froyo app maxes out at 5), you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not over covering the connectivity - the "microUSB port" as we called it for convenience is actually a MHL port. If you plug a MHL dongle in it, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV - the qHD resolution has the perfect 16:9 aspect ratio for connecting to HDTVs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser we like a lot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser, plenty of processing power and a large, high-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like find on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE's browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE has full Flash support and YouTube videos up to 720p played quite smoothly. 1080p however proves too much for the browser and the video gets extremely choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We even decided to try out a few Flash games and they worked fine as well. You can play the Flash content in full screen and landscape mode, which makes the most out of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Sensation XE, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents but not 2007 docs or presentations. Oddly, you can edit existing Power Pint Presentations and Office 2007 docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of Polaris gives less editing options than we're used to - you can do copy, cut and paste, then apply bold, italic and underline styles and highlight text and that's it. There used to be font style options here but now they're inexplicably gone. You can't edit formulas in Excel spreadsheets either, which is a major stumbling block for doing Office document editing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Sensation XE into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two handy search apps: Quick lookup and Search Anywhere. Quick lookup lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatter for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which let you post on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (yet another way to talk to your friends) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into the likes of Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android also comes preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (they both integrate with the phonebook so you don?t have to actually start the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app is the latest version too ? tweets can be geotagged, you can snap a photo to include in the tweet straight in the app (uploaded automatically to yfrog or TwitPic) and there are handy buttons to reply to or retweet a message.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market, HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market had another visual boost lately plus a layout redesign. Now you get a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This organization reminds a lot of the Apple's App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-app section is untouched though and we still find it quite unattractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Sensation XE contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Sensation XE in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and HTC Locations to navigate you<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in a minute and 50 seconds (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE also comes with HTC Places, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (provider of the software) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate new routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t (it can only reroute you, not calculate a new route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free. You can always pay for a voice-guided navigation license too - it's cheaper than buying a dedicated GPS unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC have a flagship they want to keep you interested in. Easier said than done. Six months after the launch of the original, the HTC Sensation XE is raising the bar. But HTC are trying to keep a fine balance. They wouldn't want to push the envelope and make the original Sensation obsolete. The bar shouldn't be set too high either before the next flagship is due.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as we can tell, they nailed it. They had a 4.3" qHD-screened dual-core-powered super droid to work with and these are not easy specs to top. Yet, the Sensation XE received a bigger battery and a faster processor. We find the new model more attractive than the original too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the improved sonic experience though that makes much more difference than the clock speed and battery backup. This is not a mere boost to functionality - it gives the whole package purpose, a way to connect with its specific target audience. Beats Audio may be just a software tweak but it might turn out the right thing for HTC in their bid to up their multimedia game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16GB of extra storage on a complimentary microSD card and the premium set of headphones are no gimmick though. We wouldn't say no to the right accessories - especially when they fetch a handsome price if you have to buy them separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been six months since the launch of the original HTC Sensation. We guess it's still pretty high on people's wish lists. HTC's top droids enjoying good demand shouldn't be a surprise. The way we see it, users can choose between the older flagship for slightly less and a well-accessorized new model, which doesn't cost more than the original at launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, it shouldn't be too hard for HTC to handle two droid flagships either. it's what the competition's been doing too. Sony Ericsson just gave their Xperia Arc a speed boost in the shape of the Arc S. Over at Samsung, it's the Galaxy S and the Galaxy S Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc ? Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S Samsung Galaxy S ? Samsung Galaxy S Plus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more likely rivals than that though. Most major manufacturers have at least one heavyweight contender to challenge HTC in the dual-core league. The likes of Samsung Galaxy S II, LG Optimus 3D, and even Apple's iPhone 4S will not let the Sensation get away without a fight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II ? LG Optimus 3D ? Apple iPhone 4S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While screen size and raw power have never been an issue for HTC, they seem to lack the reputation of Samsung and Apple when it comes to multimedia and entertainment. That's another important aspect of the Sensation XE - it's in charge of a lineup that wants to change that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's still just a pair of phones but a pair that needs to be taken seriously. The other BeatsAudio branded handset is the Sensation XL, which is said to come with even deeper Beats integration. Extending the audio enhancements to games and movies as well, HTC is addressing the overall sonic experience and not just the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation XL</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And guess who recently acquired a majority stake in Beats electronics. Yes, you guessed it right. It's HTC and it won't be long perhaps before we start seeing more BeatsAudio branded phones. What better way to promote a new feature than putting it on your current flagship? Yes, the Sensation XE does well to create a stir at the Android top and put HTC back on the radar of power users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you recently bought a Sensation, the XE may not be worth it, but we will understand a tinge of regret.</paragraph>
