			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If there was anything certain after the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S4, it was the imminent arrival of a mini version. The question wasn't whether or when - the Galaxy S4 mini is drafting even closer behind the flagship than its predecessor did last season. It was how much - as in how much smaller and how much cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is yet to get a price tag but the lower-res screen and less powerful chipset will certainly result in a meaningful discount. The Galaxy S4 mini will skip the top-of the-line Exynos 5 Octa and Snapdragon 600, settling for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset with 1.7GHz dual Krait cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the rest of the key specs:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 mini at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung did well to keep the Super AMOLED screen and the resolution cut isn't too painful. qHD looks reasonably well on a 4.3" diagonal. The comfortably compact Galaxy S4 mini is the flagship in miniature, replicating the original design to the last detail, from the layout of controls, through the finish, to the location of the IR port. It is the same Android version ticking inside too, topped with TouchWiz 5.0 Nature UX. Even most of the air gestures of the big Galaxy S4 are available on the S4 mini too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, although the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini has been designed with budget in mind, it's mostly the hardware that was affected. The mini version of the Galaxy S4 is a feature-rich package, and users should have little to worry about if it behaves as promised. We'll get to what kind of performance you can expect but let's first get the design and build out of the way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini measures 124.6 x 61.3 x 8.9 mm, and it's quite surprising actually how much smaller it is than the flagship. More importantly though, the Galaxy S4 mini is nearly the same size as a Galaxy S III mini, thinner at that, while offering a bigger screen of higher-resolution. Not a bad way to start.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is a downsized replica of the flagship and the less imposing physique has lost some premium feel. On a positive note, the Galaxy S4 mini is very comfortable to hold and operate single-handedly. And it doesn't look bad after all, particularly for a mid-range device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's just that the competition too has adequately powered and seriously good looking alternatives in the midrange. The likes of Sony Xperia SP, the LG Optimus F7 and a few Nokia Lumias will be a major source of pressure. Looking exactly like the top dog won't guarantee the mini anything but it seems Samsung is not taking it for granted this time around - like they did with the S III mini last year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's take a good look at the handset. Bellow the display you get the usual three keys: capacitive Menu and Back buttons and a regular press Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as a bunch of sensors. Other than the traditional ambient light and proximity sensors, there should be an IR gesture too to pick up the cool Air gestures in applications such as the web browser and music player. There's also a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera for video-calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is where the volume rocker is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side there's only a power key. Considering the original Galaxy S4 hasn't got a dedicated camera key, we couldn't possibly expect to find one here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy S4 features the 3.5mm audio jack, the secondary microphone and the IR blaster that allows you to use the smartphone as a remote control for your home appliances. There's also a feature-rich remote control app, so the functionality is available right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port resides alongside the primary microphone at the bottom and is used for both data connections and charging. USB host and MHL are not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back, the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini sports an 8MP camera, capable of recording 1080p video, and a LED flash below its lens. The loudspeaker grille is in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The package is powered by a 1900mAh battery. The microSD card slot and the microSIM compartment are located under the battery itself, so hot-swap is not an option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini uses a 4.3" Super AMOLED screen of qHD resolution (960 x 540 pixels). The pixel density clocks in at 256 ppi, which is quite good, particularly when you consider the matrix used is not of the Pentile variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead it uses a layout similar to that of the Galaxy Note II with three subpixels per pixel, where the blue sub-pixel is twice as large as the red and green ones. That's a clever way to prolong the life of the screen, without sacrificing anything in terms of sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can find sharper 720p screens in these parts of the market now, but you'll need to live without the benefits of the AMOLED technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Galaxy S4 mini display offers above average image quality for a midrange device. Colors a punchy, blacks are as deep as AMOLED gets them and the viewing angles are extremely wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also put the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini screen under our microscope to show you its peculiar display matrix.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is really easy to handle with its curved back fitting nicely in the palm of your hand. Given the friendlier, compact size, the slippery finish is a lot less an issue than it was in the bigger Galaxy S4. Single-handed operation is very comfortable and the AMOLED screen is a pleasure to look at, both indoors and outdoors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface same as Galaxy S4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini has the same software version as the original Galaxy S4. Android 4.2.2 Jelly bean is skinned with TouchWiz Nature UX and most of the special treats of the Galaxy S4 are available here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini features the new lockscreen widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message, beautiful images pulled from TripAdvisor providing the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect though you can switch back to the old one or disable it altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in unskinned Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice trick is the Quick glance option we first saw on the Galaxy Note II. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and will light up the screen to show the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen and the notification area are identical to what you get in the original Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles at the top of the notification area to quickly enable and disable features. There are more than you can see, of course - swipe to reveal the rest. Or you can tap the new button that displays a grid of all the shortcuts, 20 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can hide this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders. Widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a discreet but useful change to the way you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen - there's a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini comes with the Multi-window feature as well. It runs two apps side by side on the screen. You can adjust the division line giving one app more space. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Air and Motion gestures, and Smart Screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes with most of the advanced gestures and features the original Galaxy S4 introduced, complete with the relevant sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is Air View - the phone can detect your finger hovering over the screen. This enables information preview (e.g. SMS text, calendar entry text and so on), previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (works with previous button too), previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects fingers 1cm / 0.5" away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you wanted to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another set of "air" features are the Air Gestures. Quick Glance is one of them, but there's more. The rest of the air commands are triggered by waving your hand over the Galaxy S4 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use this to scroll web pages in the browser (vertical waves), switch between tabs (horizontal waves), skip tracks in the music player and browse photos in the gallery, accept a call and move app shortcuts and S Planner events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air Gestures can detect your hand from up to 7cm (just under 3") and might prove useful in some situations. Note that only the native apps support them, they won't work with third party apps (even Chrome that comes preinstalled).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotation features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer feedback to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is Smart Scroll and Smart Pause, but it's questionable how much those will be missed. Sure the two features have their appeal to some, but their implementation isn't perfectly smooth just yet and would have probably behaved even worse on the less capable hardware of the Galaxy S4 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of motion gestures too, which are not exactly new. There's direct call (dial the contact whose info you're currently viewing by lifting the phone up to your ear), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by turning the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A swipe with the palm takes a screenshot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Air View-enabled gallery makes it to the S4 mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy S4 mini is the same as the flagship's. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There's also a spiral option, which revamps the gallery into a Scalado-like spiral of images and video, which after a while gets really nauseating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails. Air view works in the gallery as well. You can hover your finger above an image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail overview or you can use it to peek inside folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an album's contents, a right swipe will reveal a bar with the rest of the albums available. In this mode you can browse images in a dual-screen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on a picture, the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos on the Galaxy S4 mini is a nice experience. The screen is ample and Super AMOLED treats you to very pleasant colors. The gallery naturally supports full-res images. You can enable the Adobe RGB screen mode for accurate color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily edit photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also put down a note over the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery supports highly customizable slideshows, too, with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy S4 mini is the same as the one on the Galaxy S4. It is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC, Wave, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support (which is more often found on third party players) - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music square is quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and lets you build playlists matching your mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini can also search for content on third party players like PCs on the same network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options: a timeline, play/pause and skip controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, an AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini has a couple of features that will further improve your listening experience. One is Smart Sound, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - an audio calibration tool that tries to combine the most comfortable highs and lows for the best audio in calls and music. This way the phone can map the capacity of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the calibration is complete, the Galaxy S4 mini shows you the kind of gain you're receiving by keeping Adapt Sound on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An 8MP snapper with a host of cool features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes with an 8MP main camera and a 2MP front-facer, but unlike its bigger brother, the smartphone can't use both t the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the Galaxy Camera interface. The viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution - if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings are found in two places. The first is the Mode button under the shutter key. It brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops the text but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper left corner, there are a couple of quick settings plus an arrow to reveal more options. As for the different camera modes, it's a collection of some of the best camera features currently available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrow at the bottom of the screen brings up a row of color effects. Each effect gets a live preview, so you can see what the particular scene will look like with it. There's a download button so you can grab more effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more settings in the top left corner, but they won't be very often used. Still, there a number of interesting options here like having the volume rocker act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. The HDR mode (Rich Tone) can be set to save a normal and an HDR photo or just the HDR one. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy S4 mini will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go over the different modes. There are standard modes like Rich Tone (HDR), Panorama, Night and Sports. Panoramas are nice, they do a full 360° circle, but the resolution is not that impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get into the more interesting shots. Drama mode takes a moving object and clones it several times. Note that the resolution for this mode drops to 1080p. Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roar of car engines if you're at a race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini unit we're using for this preview hasn't got its hardware and software finalized, so we'll leave the image quality discussion for the review. Still, we snapped a few shots to give you a feel for the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a 1080p@30 fps video sample taken with the Galaxy S4 mini. Just don't forget this is a pre-release unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung-exclusive software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes with a number of advanced features and apps that are exclusive to the S4 lineup for now, but will eventually trickle down to older devices via updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini and use multiple phones as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right, all the way up to surround sound). This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy S4 mini becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight something in the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice has all the features we're already familiar with, but also comes with a car mode that simplifies the interface and makes text bigger. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look up local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but it adds a lot of new functionality Some of these features are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy S4 mini to answer a call or snooze an alarm by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The problem with S Voice is that it's still not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or by using speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't thing your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, S Health is Samsung's home-brewed health and fitness tracking application. It starts off by getting you to create a profile which includes all your stats, such as age/weight/gender and level of activity, plus your calorie consumption goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has a pleasant interface and can track your progress, in terms of walking distance, exercise, and fitness, taking into account environmental influences, such as temperature. S Health also supports a number of optional accessories, which enable it to give even more detailed info on your status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think it's quite likely for more S Apps to made it to the retail Galaxy S4 mini such as S-Link, Photo Reader and even the Cento OnTV remote app that works with IR blaster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini can have better hopes of success than its predecessor. Coming in the wake of one of the best phones in the market, the S4 mini is sure to benefit from the most aggressive marketing campaign Samsung has had so far. Not only does it look like the flagship but has many of its premium features, like air gestures and smart screen. It could?ve done a lot worse than a qHD AMOLED display too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems it was important to Samsung to do better than it did last year with the Galaxy S III mini. The hardware had to take a hit of course, but the Krait cores are doing a fine job, while the qHD screen is a lot easier on the chipset and battery while having enough resolution for pleasant viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will be some 720p competitors to consider for sure but WVGA is still the most likely resolution in the segment. So, the Galaxy S4 mini is probably on the right lines. Good enough screen, a rich software package, and friendly size are the right things to keep it spirits high. It?s up to Samsung to take care of the other side of the equation too ? the price.</paragraph>
