			<paragraph>We've already welcomed the W595 at the proto stage, but this time it's the real deal - we have a retail unit on our hands and we are ready to put it through its paces. The differences from the preceding model, the W580, stretch further than a design overhaul. A 2.2-inch QVGA display and the 3.2 megapixel camera will surely make it a tasty treat even without all the Walkman goodies on board. With its modern looks and intriguing specs list, it's about time we saw what the Sony Ericsson W595 brings to the Walkman party.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 is currently retailing for about 200 euro - which seems like a reasonable price - but a true evaluation demands a little digging and some comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, the Sony Ericsson W760 is really close sibling of W595. It currently sells for a bit less than the W595, but outperforms it with tri-band HSDPA support and of course, the built-in GPS receiver. The way the prices currently are, the W595 doesn't seem to stand a chance to the W760.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W760</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again surprisingly, you can get the capable Sony Ericsson C902 Cyber-shot for the same price as the W595. It's got a nice slide-up cover over the 5 megapixel snapper, a bunch of touch-sensitive camera shortcuts and pretty similar multimedia capabilities. It's not a slider, but not every phone has to be, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson C902</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said all that, the Sony Ericsson W595 Walkman phone simply seems a bit overpriced right now. Once the situation changes, it would perhaps turn out to be a rather attractive package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meet us on the next page, where we'll go through its looks, handling and ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Ericsson W595<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W595 has all you may possibly need in its retail package. A battery charger, USB data cable and a headset is stuff you take for granted. The stereo headphones are bass-reflex type, but look a bit modest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a two-piece headset with a large Stereo Share adapter in the middle, which has two 3.5 mm plugs, so you can use two set of earphones of your choice and share your music with a friend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the standard equipment, the W595 ships with a 2 gig M2 card, which most users find enough for storing their favorite songs. Finally a bunch of leaflets fill the rest of the retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Expected to succeed the W580, the W595 has the same slider form factor and superior looks. The metallic accents and rubbery surface on the back and sides of the W595 really boost the handling and aesthetics of the device. The symmetrical slanting top and bottom remind us of the good old W580 and the elderly, but still cool Sony Ericsson W910 and are much to our liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Measuring 100 x 47 x 14 mm and weighing 104g, the W595 is quite pocketable. The 2.2" 262K-color QVGA display takes up most of the front panel and is a real point in favor of the Sony Ericsson W595. It sports a really sharp and lively image with great contrast and brightness levels, reminding us of the W902 we recently reviewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys below the display are just the same as the Sony Ericsson W902 in terms of functionality but this time they are much larger and thus more comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is revealed by sliding the Sony Ericsson W595 open. We generally found it comfortable to use although it is somewhat lacking in terms of tactile feedback. The keys are large with sufficient spacing between each, making it easy to type without looking at the keypad. The keys also seem durable, so the W580's notorious cracking keypad issues seem unlikely with the W595.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman key on the Sony Ericsson W595 is on the right side and grants access to the same features as on the W902 - accessing the Walkman player and using the Shake control. The key is however a bit smaller than we would have liked it to be. It's rather hard to press but you would probably get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 is equipped with large and loud stereo speakers, each placed at the sloping top and bottom. This layout is rather useful if you listen to music with the phone laid on a flat surface. Thankfully, the Sony Ericsson logo on the back of the W595 is embedded, so resting the phone on a table will cause no wobbles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three megapixel camera lens is located at the back. Unlike the W902, the W595 lacks a flash to help with night-time shooting. Now, add that to the fixed focus and you get the idea that photography wasn't high on the company's list of priorities with this phone. As you might suspect, there's no protective lens cover either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But don't let all that put you off, the W595 is stall capable of producing some really nice shots, which you'll see in the dedicated chapter of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover fits tightly to the back of the body. The only problem is with removing the cover as it's the pry-to-open type seen on a lot of the recent phones by SE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To open it up you have to pull really hard on the top right corner, which bends the back panel pretty hard before it gets released. The plastic is pretty thin and after frequent bending it may crack - just as it did on our unit. Let's hope you don't need to exchange your SIM or memory card too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get the hang of the battery cover of the W595, underneath you will find the 950 mAh BST-33 Li-Po battery. It is quoted at 9 hours of talk time and 385 hours of stand-by time, which is basically the same as the Sony Ericsson W902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing of interest under the Sony Ericsson's W595 back panel is the M2 card slot, which is used for expanding the 40 MB of built-in memory. The 2 GB card that ships with the handset will probably be enough for most users but the rest can opt for higher capacity cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Sony Ericsson W595 is great. The handset feels solid in the hand and the rubberized surface also provides one of the best grips we have seen on a mobile phone - the W595 just sticks to your hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the rounded shape on both the upper and bottom sides makes the W595 very pocket friendly. Combine that with the thin size and you get an almost perfectly constructed phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface shines<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The W595 user interface is the same as on the W902 - user-friendly, quick and with a lot of available options and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the high-end Sony Ericsson W902, the W595 has the most advanced version of the UI. It is customizable with Flash Lite themes and hardly ever stays static. The interface offers an extensive set of options and settings. They are complemented by great speed, which further improves the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Sony Ericsson have set up a nice little interactive demo tool for you to explore the phone interface and features online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information at the top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper below is always on the move and really comes alive when the music player is on, making smooth transitions when playback starts or stops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden and are simply there to indicate what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar, which features tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the Sony Ericsson W980, you can minimize the progress indicator when receiving a file over Bluetooth, but you can't do that when sending one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. Auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive. There's a barely noticeable lag before the rotation takes place, but we think that's to be preferred over an over-sensitive accelerometer that plays up all the time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Traditional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way, you can set up the phone to auto save to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your contacts list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact uses the tabbed interface used throughout the phone. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and does so quite well, even a "John von Smith" wouldn't be a problem. Naturally, you can search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems with the Sony Ericsson W595. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Search is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It displays in four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 scored an Excellent mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson W595 offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages. The Manage Messages application enhances message handling and messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W595 handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox. When composing a message, a warning is displayed when you exceed the 160-character limit to let you know that the message will be divided in two (or more if necessary) parts for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a rich T9 dictionary. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when typing SMS you could easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically downloaded the settings for our test Gmail account. The options to view messages full screen and change font size really helped to get a lot of text on the screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the phone doesn't recognize the file type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can't handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Media Center keeps things in line<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Media Center on the Sony Ericsson W595 is the centerpiece of the phone's interface. It is in essence a gallery for all the media the device can handle, all navigated through a sleek, simple and intuitive interface. It allows instant access to the Photos, Music, Videos, Games and Web Feeds on the handset. The current pick is highlighted and the number of stored files is displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Sony Ericsson W595 is equipped with a built-in accelerometer, the Media center interface rotates automatically to match the handset orientation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson photo gallery is definitely among the best we've found in a feature phone. It's a convenient tool for managing a vast collection of pictures with great features and customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of those options include: one-click access to the latest snapshot you've taken, a timeline view for your images, and tags that can later be used for filtering. With the Sony Ericsson W595 you can also mark some of your photos as favorites and make accessing them even easier through the favorite photo filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos is a joy with the Sony Ericsson W595, especially when browsing images fullscreen. When you want to go to the next in line, it doesn't simply pop up but instead slides in from left or right. Then, when exiting the full screen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One place where the music and imaging capabilities of the phone come together is the Slide show. You're prompted to pick a mood (you can choose "silent" too) so it can set the proper music background and transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone doesn't have a GPS receiver but still does geotagging using Cell ID. Using Google Maps, you have the option to view the location (approximate of course) where the picture was taken</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Walkman rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 features the Walkman 3.0 player with all possible extras included. Accessed from the very smart Media menu, the player supports a vast collection of file formats and has several equalizer presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you also get Album art and the proprietary Sony Ericsson Shake control, which makes use of the phone's built-in accelerometer. The accelerometer is also put to use for automatic rotation of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the music player also offers step-by-step filtering of the tracks you want to hear. The D-pad is in charge of music controls and also brings up a list of all the tracks in the current playlist or album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "Now playing" screen is simple but offers all the necessary controls and information. The D-pad offers playback control with their functions shown at the bottom of the screen. Above them is information on the current track such as album art, song duration, track name, performer and album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of album art, you can opt for visualizations but since they occupy the same small space as the album art, don't expect a great light show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The animations on the home screen during playback make up for that though. They depend on the currently selected Flash Lite theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you minimize the music player, the currently playing track, album and artist get displayed on the home screen with some nice graphics that perfectly blend with the screen if a Flash Lite theme is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer offers only 5 presets (including "Normal") but you can customize them. Luckily, the Mega Bass preset is also onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another highly promoted Walkman feature is Shake control. It allows you to change the currently running track and even shuffle your entire playlist with a simple flick of the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use Shake control is press the Walkman key and shake the phone forward (for going one track forward) or backward (for going a track back). Both moves in quick succession does the shuffle trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn the volume up and down by gently tilting the handset while you hold the Walkman key pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other music-related Walkman goodie, SensMe, offers a different approach to populating a playlist. Instead of choosing genre or performer, you are presented with a coordinate system. The vertical axis is the tempo - fast to slow, and the horizontal axis is the mood - sad to happy. Songs are shown as dots placed accordingly and you use a circle to select the one fitting your mood best. You can of course modify the radius of the circle and repeat this several times for a single playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As cool as that sounds it does have one inconvenience - the songs must be tagged by the Sony Ericsson Media Manager software. To do this you use the manager to transfer the songs with the SensMe analysis option enabled. Tagging songs by hand is not possible so you need to choose between analyzing the songs with the Media Manager, which takes a while, or do without SensMe until you have more time to transfer the songs properly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Sony Ericsson W595 is a mixed bag. Much like with the W902 our hopes that the distinct music focus of the handset and Sony's great experience in the area will deliver great results weren't exactly justified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main issue is the frequency response of the Sony Ericsson W595 which deviates from the perfect severely. It has extremely boosted bass and treble and reduced mid frequency sounds. The graph looks as if an equalizer has been applied only that it wasn't. We can hardly imagine how far off the frequency response will be if you actually apply one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side all of the other reading are pretty good with the distortion levels simply great. The stereo crosstalk is also one of the best we have come upon recently. You can see for yourselves from the following results that save for the frequency response the Sony Ericsson W595 is quite a gifted musician.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on the Sony Ericsson W595 supports RDS and TrackID. You can store up to 20 stations and use the auto save feature to scan and save stations automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio can be minimized to play in the background and controlled via the Walkman keys but, unlike the music player, it doesn't have any visualization on the home screen, not even RDS info. The previous/next buttons can be used for tuning in - one short click for going 0.1 MHz up or down, and a longer press for switching between saved stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Sony Ericsson W595 supports fast-forward, rewind, and slow-mo playback. It can play in landscape and has three options for video size - original, auto fit and full screen (which crops the video if needed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of the video player is the screenshot capability. It allows you to save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is basic, but still shoots well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 packs a 3.15-megapixel autofocus camera capable of taking shots at a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels (the average file size is a tad below 900 KB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W595 is a Walkman and, unlike the W902, imaging is very much secondary to the music features. Video recording is the same - QVGA resolution at 15 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You still get a few niceties like auto-rotate, camera images geo-tagging (based on cell-ID), but BestPic, macro mode or stabilization are missing. The user interface has a typical Cyber-shot arrangement but with the extras left out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Settings are displayed in the viewfinder on a toolbar with pop-up submenus. Traditionally, the viewfinder toolbar lets you control shoot mode, scenes, picture size, self-timer, white balance, effects, and settings (Multi menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 doesn't have GPS on-board but is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images based on cell tower triangulation. This seems to work reasonably accurately in dense city areas where cell towers are closely positioned, but this may vary in other scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When browsing tagged images in the gallery, you have access to a "View on map" tab from the options menu, which displays your location directly on the preinstalled Google Maps. If you pair the phone with an external Bluetooth GPS receiver, the geotagging feature automatically starts to use it to collect exact GPS coordinates for the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer the camera is also able to auto-rotate your images when you are previewing them. The silent shooting mode completes the features list of the W595 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595's camera produces nice images with a fair level of detail and no purple fringing. We definitely see a nice improvement over the pre-release unit we had for previewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of our concerns with the image quality is that the sharpening is a bit too much. It's supposed to compensate for the aggressive noise reduction routine, which not only creates a water color effect over some areas (the foliage), but also eradicates detail in the shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side however, the images look really nice and punchy straight out of the camera with no further editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the W595 is also capable of capturing video, even though it's limited to QVGA resolution at 15fps. The clips are recorded in mp4 format and take about 3 MB for every minute of recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The W595 offers the full range of connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board, so there's virtually no spot on earth where you won't be able to get connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you've got the fastest data transfer around, provided that a HSDPA-enabled network is available. By the way, the compatible UMTS frequency is only 2100Mhz. Like the C902, the Sony Ericsson W595 will have localized versions (W595a for America and W595c for China) but only the W595 will have HSDPA support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, Sony Ericsson W595 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile, allowing you to listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, there is also the M2 card slot which might just turn out to be one of the quickest means of transferring data on certain occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB connectivity has four modes. The first one is File transfer, which is self-explanatory. Then comes the USB Internet in case you need to use the phone as a modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third one is the Media transfer, which directly connects to Windows media player allows for synchronizing your WMP music and playlists with the phone. The last one is the PictBridge one, used for direct printing of images.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing: screen size is the limit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 has an Access NetFront browser featuring the extended custom home screen, also available in many previous Sony Ericsson handsets (like W902 , G705 and C905 we recently reviewed). Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and address bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, and include a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. The dedicated full screen mode is replaced by the auto-rotate feature, which actually opens it in full-screen landscape mode. View modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom, and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is a real pleasure to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page and the first match is immediately listed as soon as you type a letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are still not satisfied with the browser, you can always rely on the superb OperaMini as a suitable replacement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Alarms, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator, and Code memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly and weekly views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts you to add it to the calendar. Tasks can be of two types: simple tasks and phone calls. Notes are written in a similar way to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarms are part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one and the stopwatch and countdown timer are the familiar basic applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loads of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, the Sony Ericsson W595 comes with quite a few preinstalled: Comeks Strips, Music Mate, Music Quiz, World Clock 3d, Rock Bobblehead, Walk Mate and a YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comeks Strips is an application that lets you add speech bubbles and various comic-style add-ons to your camera photos. The comics you make can be then saved or sent via MMS. Making comics is fun and easy following the step-by-step wizard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most interesting applications that come preinstalled on the Sony Ericsson W595 is the Music Mate 5. It consists of several music-centered mini applications. The first of them allows you to play music by shaking your phone. You can choose from a huge list of musical instruments for each direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music Mate 5 also includes a Beatbox with quite a variety of beats. The application can also help you play the guitar or keyboard by demonstrating the proper finger positions for individual chords. Finally, the Music Mate 5 includes a guitar tuner that can help you tune your guitar using the phone's microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Quiz is exactly what its name says - you have to name the title, artist, album or year of release of random tracks in your music library. Long story short: a part of a song is played each round and you have 5 to 30 seconds to guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rock Bobblehead is a totally useless application allowing you to play bobblehead with an Elvis Presley doll using the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>World Clock 3D allows you to spin the globe searching for a time zone. You can zoom in and out as you please. Of course you can also search by a city name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walk Mate is a simple step counter application which works in background mode getting its data from the the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And at the end we find the YouTube client, which gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarking favorites and so on. It's really nice and it's also tightly integrated into the Media center, so it's always on hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the beta of the Java application is available for download over at the YouTube website for any other Java-enabled phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, the Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled on the W595. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all features of the Location services internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance, based on the available information in the database. With the GPS Enabler HGE-100, plugged in, Location service gets full GPS functionality, as well as A-GPS for faster satellite lock. This makes it possible to use navigation on the go, with turn-by-turn guidance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view. Traffic information is another important feature here. The user interface is nice and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a plugged in GPS receiver, the Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60 minutes period. The GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is as easy as it could be. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games are amusing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 comes with four preinstalled games - Extreme Air Snowboarding, Guitar Rock Tour, QuadraPop and Racing Fever GT. These games are not exactly new or original but provide enough diversity to keep you entertained for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is Extreme Air Snowboarding. It's similar to Tony Hawk's popular skating games but focuses on snowboarding. The aim of the game is simple enough - ride downhill and do as many tricks as you can - the more complex the trick, the more points you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next is Guitar Rock Tour which is, as you can guess from the screenshots below, a clone of Guitar Hero. It's a rhythm game in which you need to press a button at the exact moment when the note slides down to the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QuadraPop is the simplest of the four but probably the most entertaining. It is a combination of Tetris and JewelQuest. "Blocks" of two notes fall down, like in Tetris, but you need to get four or more identical notes to next to each other (not necessarily in a line) to make them "pop".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Racing Fever GT. It's a 3D racing game with Career mode or Quick race mode. The graphics are not spectacular but it can kill a spare five minutes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W595 is clearly a mid-range product and a very capable music phone we might add. Of course, there is still a trade-off to be made when choosing between the Walkman or the Cyber-shot part of the Sony Ericsson portfolio and in this case it's camera auto focus. But we are satisfied with the W595 image quality and have no grudge there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, at a price point of 200 euro (250 US dollars), the W595 is heavily overpriced and its own siblings such as Sony Ericsson C902 and W760 are also its greatest rivals. And truth be told, the W595 can't really fight back when those two are involved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So looking forward to better times with more reasonable pricing, we part ways with the Sony Ericsson W595 left with nothing but positive impressions.</paragraph>
