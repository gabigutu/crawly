			<paragraph>Subdued elegance and decent feature set give Nokia 6555 its edge in the crowded midrange. The two quality displays and great keypad provide for comfortable handling, while 3G support adds to the excitement with this elegantly tall and sleek clamshell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6555 is a midrange 3G-enabled handset, joining the clamshell ranks of the Finnish company. The form factor inevitably brings back memories of the likeable push-to-open Nokia 6131. Nokia 6555 lacks the auto-open functionality but the 3G support is one of the strong points of this stylish clamshell.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slender black<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing about Nokia 6555 to sure make an impression is its elongated silhouette. Compared to 6131, Nokia 6555 is 8 mm taller and 4 mm narrower, keeping the same thickness. The actual dimensions are 99.6 x 44.3 x 19.6 mm, at a weight of 97 g. We are testing the black variety, but Nokia 6555 is also available in sliver, red and beige. The colors only vary on both the front and rear framing; the middle glossy sections on the face and the back of the handset are always black. Enclosed in handsome chrome-colored accents, they do contribute to the stylish looks and feel of the device, but are critically prone to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is all made of plastic. Those expecting elite expensive materials could be disappointed but after all it's a midrange handset, which by the way looks above its class. The glossy finish and the mirror external display are nicely highlighted by the chrome accents, which do enhance the elongated shape of Nokia 6555.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't help reminisce of the KRZR K3, which is a true looker. The 6555 is another Nokia clamshell, along with the N76, to feature a chin at the foot of the lower flip in the style of the Motorola RAZR bunch and its offshoots. In Nokia 6555 the chin is reclined to match the etched end of the flip, giving the handset its sharp profile in both open and closed position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three connectors are placed at the sides of the handset. At the bottom on the right is the charger plug, while the 2.5 mm headphone jack is at the top. The microUSB port is on the left, along with the lanyard eyelet. The side of the flip features the dedicated camera key and the volume rocker. The whole threesome offers good elevation and tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole rear panel is the battery compartment cover. It features the same chrome-colored accents as the front and, when the flip is open, the chrome lines join in one oblong shape. The battery cover removes easily, but could've been a lot more solid. A little extra pressure will result in audible creaks. Underneath is the reasonably capable 1020 mAh Li-Ion battery, quoted at 300 hours in stand-by and 390 minutes talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery are the SIM bed and the microSD card slot. The memory card is not hot-swappable; the handset has to power off before inserting or removing the card. Nokia 6555 supports microSD cards of up to 4 GB capacity, but none is shipped with the handset.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Elite keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The upper end of both parts of the flip look sliced off, the only thing that sticks out is the round hinge. It is quite solid and secure, except for an insignificant sideways wobble in open position. Opening the phone with one hand is quite easy. The Nokia 6555 has a very comfortable wider opening angle, well above many other clamshells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone open reveals two silver frames - one hosts the display, the other encloses the alphanumeric keypad and the control and navigation buttons. Nokia 6555 offers an ample and comfortable D-pad, surrounded by equally commendable pair of soft keys and Call and End buttons. The End key serves the double purpose of a Power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the same token, the alphanumeric keypad offers comfortable size, and secure keypresses marked by pleasant clicks. All alphanumeric buttons are notched at the top for better touch orientation. Of course, fast typing without looking at the keys requires some practice but, overall, the keypad works out quite well. The quality white backlighting sure contributes to the above statement too. Below the keypad, a thin strip stick out, serving as the flip cushion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: predictable quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia were kind enough to not be over economical with the displays. The screen properties are similar to the Nokia 6131. Very few clamshells can beat the Nokia 6555 in the display department. The external display is 256K-color TFT of a 128 x 160 pixel resolution and 22 x 27 mm size. Inside you get a primary 2" 16M-color QVGA display. When you flip the handset closed, the external display takes over to show all the essential information: signal strength, battery status, operator name and current date and time. You can set wallpaper and an animated screensaver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After a certain time, the animated screensaver gets replaced by a digital clock and date, which are fairly well readable under all kinds of lighting. Quite handily, notifications of missed events also get displayed alongside, so you won't have to flip the phone open to check missed calls. Right under the external display is the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary display is a few millimeters short of that on Nokia 6131. The 31 x 41 mm QVGA screen offers very good picture quality with deep colors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Series 40 5th again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardly anyone would expect user interface and functionality marvels in a midrange handset, and Nokia 6555 offers no surprises. The clamshell runs on the Series 40 5th edition UI. This version is seen in quite a number of recent releases by the Finnish company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: some screenshots were borrowed from Nokia 6500 slide and 6500 classic. The UI of Nokia 6555 is identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby mode is a standard S40 feature offering a wide range of customization options. The confirming center of the D-pad launches the main menu, the two soft keys can be assigned a variety of functions. If Go to is assigned to the left soft key, it will activate a list of user defined shortcuts to select items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each way on the D-pad can be assigned basically any function too. The selected shortcuts can then be set to appear on the display when active standby is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be viewed in four different ways: list, grid, grid with legends and horizontal tabs. All the icons within it can be rearranged to the user's liking. There are seven themes preloaded and additional ones are downloadable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6555 offers a particularly practical voice control. It needs no voice tag pre-recording and works with many of the phone's features. The phone's firmware is updatable straight through the GSM network. New versions are downloaded and installed on-the-fly, without the need of a PC. Another very handy feature is the option to copy and paste text across applications. For example, you can easily copy part of an SMS into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the events log, it is worth noting that the S40 5th doesn't just notify of a text received or missed call, but also displays the contact's name and the time of the event. With Nokia 6555, that only holds true for the primary screen. Don't be expecting this much detail on the external display. An interesting option allows the user to configure the behavior of the mini display upon flipping the phone closed. The options are switching to standby or keeping the actual screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>One megapixel should do<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even if a midrange offering, we just can't help feeling disappointed with the camera on Nokia 6555. These days 2 MP are the straightforward down-the-middle type. What we get in the 6555 is a 1.3 megapixel shooter. Autofocus or LED flash are not even to be dreamed of in this range of clamshells. The lens is placed right above the external display in a slightly projecting nest. That's the only protection against scratches, and there's not much you can do about finger smudges. Clean the lens is what you'll need to do before taking a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum picture size is 1280 x 1024 pixels, the default camera interface orientation is portrait. Image quality is passable in good light, but with inadequate lighting or in high-contrast scenes prepare for excessive noise. Nokia 6555 is not capable of shooting close-ups. The photographed text is barely readable. For shooting self portraits you can use the external display as a viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample pictures taken with Nokia 6555:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera can be quickly activated by the dedicated side key, which also serves as the shutter button. In terms of settings, we're dealing with a typical low-to-mid end Nokia. Users can adjust white balance and picture quality, there's a self-release timer, burst, night mode and several color effects. Digital zoom is also available, up to 8x.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6555 captures video in 3GP format, and recording length is only limited by the available memory. Video resolution is the meager 176 x 144 pixels. The gallery - typical S40 - accommodates file manager functionality. Some basic editing may be applied on the shots, which can also be sent via Bluetooth or printed over PictBridge. The internal user available memory is about 30 MB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>UMTS, but no video calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6555 is yet another 3G capable device, which is saving on the video-call support. Within the company portfolio, there's only one non-smart clamshell to offer video calling: Nokia 6267, also available as the T-Mobile branded version Nokia 6263. Along with dual band UMTS (850/2100 MHz for Europe and 850/1900 MHz for US), Nokia 6555 offers quad band GSM support at 850, 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Nokia 6555 offers space for 1000 entries. Each contact can be assigned a number of details: five phone numbers, email, web and mailing address, birthday, company, working position and text items. Synchronization with Outlook is trouble-free. Contacts can be arranged in groups and assigned pictures and ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The searching method is gradual typing. The language-independent voice control is especially handy for calling your contacts. Push-to-talk support is there too. There are no novelties regarding ringing profiles, the handset can also be used in Flight Mode without SIM inserted. The only way to accept an incoming call is of course by flipping the phone open.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No novelties are to be expected in messaging either. The supported message types are: text, multimedia, audio, flash and email. There's a single editor for both text and multimedia messages; inserting any multimedia content (image, video, calendar note, etc) switches the editor to MMS mode. You can also pre-select the message time in the Message Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Font size can vary when composing a message, at the smallest font up to 10 lines display. A T9 dictionary goes without saying. 1000 characters is the maximum length of a text message, the character count is always displayed. The recipient number can be typed straight into the addressee box, inserted fro the phonebook or the call log. You can also set one of your contacts as favorite and it will always appear as the first choice when inserting recipient number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email application is also available under messaging. The supported protocols are POP3, SMTP and IMAP4. The email client can handle up to five accounts. Automatic retrieving of email can be set, opting between entire messages or headers only.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Flawless organization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Nokia 6555 we have the usual decent S40 organization functionality. Monthly, weekly and daily views are available for the calendar. There are five types of events to set: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application. Text notes are available as well; their length is limited to 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing applications are a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a simple calculator.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6555 offers a preinstalled a currency converter, a world time application, Opera Mini browser, along with the Yahoo search and Yahoo Go applications. The Download application connects you directly to Nokia's download center, where you can find a lot of content for you phone. Presenter allows you to remotely control PC applications from your device via Bluetooth, provided the Nokia Presenter application is installed on the computer before pairing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MP3 yes, radio no<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The multimedia capabilities of Nokia 6555 are identical to other Series 40 5th edition handsets. The unpleasant surprise is the absence of an FM radio. The music player is the enhanced version offering customization through selectable skins. Playing in the background is traditionally available, sorting tracks by artist, album and genre is supported too. The player works with MP3, AAC, AAC+ and WMA formats. Several equalizer presets are at hand, along with a stereo expansion function. The music player interface displays on the external screen when the flip is closed but user control is limited to adjusting the volume by way of the side volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player supports the 3GP and MP4 formats. Fullscreen viewing is available, along with fast-forward and rewind. Streaming video is supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No headset was available with our test unit. What you get in the retail box is region specific, and ours didn't include headphones. Bluetooth with A2DP support allows using a stereo wireless headset with your Nokia 6555.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entertainment options are concluded with the four preinstalled games: Rally 3D, Gold Tour, Soccer 3D and Sudoku.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data and connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of data transfers Nokia 6555 is a more than decent performer. GPRS and EDGE are reinforced by UMTS support with maximum transfer speed of 384 kbps. Nokia PC Suite connectivity over USB and Bluetooth is available too and Mass Storage is enabled. Memory card support of up to 4GB is another valuable alternative but, again, no card is shipped with the phone. Another notable absence in the retail box is the data cable. Nokia 6555 employs the microUSB variety. There's no Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing capabilities of Nokia 6555 include WAP 2.0 and xHTML. Adjustable font size is routinely available. When the smallest font size is set, up to 14 lines of text fit on the display. Direct address entering is available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Looks and 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The midrange clamshell Nokia 6555 offers standard equipment and above-its-class elegance. Other than the looks, the two quality screens and the comfortable keypad are indisputable advantages. As to functionality, there are no surprises. But then, the price tag promises none. The downright drawbacks are the lack of FM radio, the 1.3 megapixel camera and the thrifty retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today's market seems flooded with handsets of similar functionality, so Nokia 6555 is in for a challenge. The clamshell design and the attractive looks will be the key features to set it apart. Even inside the Nokia family, it will be facing serious competition. Nokia 6131 continues to enjoy good demand, while 6267 offers a 2MP camera with LED flash, music player controls on the flip, video calling, VGA video recording and FM radio. It does lack however the finesse of Nokia 6555.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6555 is already available in all of its color versions. Maybe underpowered here and there, Nokia 6555 still has the attraction of affordability, style and 3G.</paragraph>
