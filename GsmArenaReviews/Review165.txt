			<paragraph>HTC had us quite eager to drop by their booth at the MWC in Barcelona and get some touchscreen action with WinMo and Android flavor. Two curious sequels in the face of the HTC Touch Pro2 and Touch Diamond2, along with the Android-based Magic sounded intriguing enough for a quick sneak peek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, it was only the HTC Touch Diamond2 that was on display at HTC booth. The Touch Pro2 and the HTC Magic are still early prototypes and were guarded pretty closely. Still, we had a good enough look on them as well, and we lived to tell the story.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch Diamond2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Holding the Diamond2 in hand, the most striking novelty is the missing D-pad/scroll wheel. By the way that's the TouchPro2 approach too. Perhaps as of Touch HD, HTC are ditching D-pads. Most users won't mind its absence in Number 2, though some situations required its use - picking an item off the relatively small high-res display of the Diamond using the touch screen with your finger is a real challenge while on a moving vehicle for example. So a more precise way of making your selections was welcomed. Nevertheless, the D-pad is nowhere to be found on these products.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, that leads us to the brand new feature in the Diamond2 - the Zoom bar, which is placed at the bottom of the screen. Basically, it does the job of the old Diamond's touch-sensitive scroll wheel. You can use it to zoom in and out on images, web pages and messages, and even in the camera. We think the bar does better than the wheel and is easier to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four hardware keys are also affected by the gone D-pad, they're now set in line right under the Zoom bar. The Back key is there of course - and quite welcome - along with two call keys and the Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display has grown both in both size and resolution, but this also happened to the device's size. The Diamond2 has 2 extra mm around the waist and we don't think there's anything much to justify that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The really nice visual upgrade however is the all-metal frame that surround the display and covers the upper part of the Diamond2 body. That's one excellent design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know what would have but no, a 3.5mm jack is not there again. The Diamond is not a music centric device, no doubt about that, but we see 3.5mm jacks in almost every high-end phone lately. Hell, even on Sony Ericsson handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And speaking quite seriously, what's up with HTC and camera keys? The new Diamond2 still doesn't have one on board. We don't really like software shutter keys and there's hardly anything that can change our mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, there's another feature that the Diamond2 lacks - it's the magnetic stylus. The stylus is active as before, it's just that it doesn't relay on magnets any more to help plugging it back in. Shame, we really liked that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the hardware changes, the Diamond2 is cut quite differently at the rear - none of the faceted splendor of the original. The only thing that reminds of the first Diamond is the brushed metal plate around the camera lens. The latter by the way is up a notch to 5 megapixels but didn't really worked nicely on the displayed units, so we won't be posting camera samples.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Diamond2 over Diamond hardware specs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As it seems however it's the software that makes the Diamond sequel so interesting. The proprietary TouchFLO 3D for finger sweep navigation is upgraded in both features and response. The difference is most notable when browsing images - the onscreen image will virtually stick to your thumb and react fluidly and almost physically. The zoom gesture of the old Diamond is not available of course now that you have the zoom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchFLO 3D of course is keeping the underlying WinMo interface pretty much under wraps. Its Home tab for example integrates the Call log, Time, Alarm application, windows calendar and weather the same way it did with the HTC Touch Pro, of which we have an in-depth preview. Opening a particular day in the calendar reveals not only the pending events but also the weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People tab has been tweaked up. It features four shortcut icons under the contact photo - mobile, work, message and email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact details are the other important upgrade here. The contacts' fields have grown in number. Selecting a contact will reveal its details and the layout is more thumbable, with bigger tabs and fields. Another convenient addition is the tabs at the bottom, which contain threaded messaging history with an option for direct reply, as well as emails and call history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Displaying a contact is quite OK. But what we were very pleasantly surprised is that editing a contact is also available in the new contacts interface so you wouldn't have to resort to underlying WinMo for that. The most commonly used fields (as with the iPhone 3G contacts) are notably larger and quite thumbable, while the rest is accessible via the original Windows Mobile interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing with the software upgrades we come to the slightly modified in-call screen as well as the redesigned software keyboard for better user friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great asset is the upgraded Start menu, which instead of a drop-down list, now appears as a fullscreen scrollable list of large icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, HTC are doing a great job with their UI plug-ins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the phone is officially announced to run on the Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional OS, later this year there will be an official upgrade to the more advanced and thumb-optimized Windows Mobile 6.5, which officially debuted here at the WMC.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch Pro2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From a portable stylish device the new reincarnation of the HTC Touch Pro is slowly making its way to UMPC. With a 3.6-inch WVGA slide-and-tilt screen, 17.5 mm of thickness and 175g of weight, it's surely one bulky device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While big may be the correct word to describe the HTC Touch Pro2, ugly is definitely not. The new design of the Pro sequel has nothing to do with its predecessor, but is definitely eye-catchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will see the family resemblance to the HTC Touch Diamond2 though. There's no D-pad again, and there's the Zoom bar, which works as horizontal version of the original scroll wheel used in the past generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keypad of the HTC Touch Pro2 feels really solid and is generally nice to use except perhaps for the first row. The metallic finish reminds a lot the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 thumboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should bear in mind however that the HTC Touch Pro2 we are looking at is not 100% the final design. Changes are due to happen, and we only hope that they will be for the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now you probably wonder how well the UI is scaled to work in landscape mode this time. Well, with the HTC Touch Pro2, the TouchFLO 3D home screen is fully functional with all its tabs. The only difference to the portrait mode is that the Tabs bar at the bottom gets hidden away automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To display the Tabs bar back on screen, you use the little arrow on the left, right at the bottom. A single press on it, brings back the tabs bar for a short while, just enough for you to scroll to the needed tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only objection to the implementation here is that the Tabs bar disappears after the preset amount of time even if you are using it in the moment. Quite nasty, yes. We hope they fix that in the final version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the HTC Touch Diamond2 and the Touch Pro2 come with the well known Opera 9.5 web browser, which works even better with the help of the new Zoom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature on the HTC Touch Pro is the second microphone at the nicely designed back of the device. It's part of the so-called Straight Talk technology and it's used for noise-cancelling purposes when using the phone in loudspeaker mode. The system turns your Touch Pro2 into a professional conference speakerphone and it can be controlled by the dedicated key on the back of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 is a really nice device and it's staking a lot on improving business calls, creating virtual conferences and eases management of calls and appointments. We are eagerly awaiting for it to get a get polished so we can put it through our reviewing drill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some comparative images with the Apple iPhone 3G and a couple of them while holding the Pro2 in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now breaking away from Windows Mobile for a change, the next page will present you the second Android-powered smartphone by HTC and definitely the first one without a QWERTY keyboard. We also have a little surprising visit from an exclusively Russian HTC device with some noteworthy specs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Magic (HTC Sapphire)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC waited for the second day of the World Mobile Congress 2009 to announce their second Android-based phone. The new device is called HTC Magic and it's going to be exclusive to Vodafone. Its design bears distinct resemblance to its predecessor - the HTC Dream only this time the slide-out QWERTY keyboard is sacrificed in order to achieve lighter weight and a slimmer silhouette.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic is basically an HTC Dream without the keyboard. The codenamed behind the HTC Magic seems to be the HTC Sapphire, that leaked in the HTC 2009 Roadmap not while ago. As the roadmap seems quite credible, we are probably going to see a T-Mobile exclusive version as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fully Touch operated HTC Magic sports a 3.2-inch display touchscreen display, much like its QWERTY-enabled sibling HTC Dream. It also comes with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band UMTS support as well as GPS and Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other features that HTC Magic shares with its predecessor are a 3 megapixel auto focus camera, Bluetooth with and USB connectivity. It also runs on the same Qualcomm 7201A platform with a 528MHz CPU and has 192MB of RAM. The ROM memory of the Magic measures 512 MB which is twice the size of the ROM of the Dream.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of comparison shots of Magic and iPhone 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will notice that the HTC Magic is quite more compact than its predecessor HTC Dream (or T-Mobile G1 if you like).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC MAX 4G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another interesting device we spotted at the HTC booth is the HTC MAX 4G. The WiMAX-enabled high-end device is exclusive for Yota WiMAX network in Russia. The handset is an HTC Touch HD replica with its 3G stripped and added WiMAX support. But there are several more new goodies on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC MAX 4G has 8GB of user storage and a proximity sensor for auto screen turn-off during calls - much like on the iPhone. The weight and dimensions remain nearly the same, but the MAX 4G is almost 2mm thicker than Touch HD. Again unlike the Touch HD, the MAX 4G has a 3 megapixel only camera.</paragraph>
