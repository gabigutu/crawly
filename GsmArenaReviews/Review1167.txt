			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung are back to basics and they say there's always room for one more in the low end. Especially one that doesn't take too much space. The Galaxy Pocket makes the Galaxy Mini look like it's on steroids and the Y series like a bunch of semi pros.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Life at the bottom of the food chain is far from enjoyable but it can be pretty exciting, and some creatures have figured out how to adapt. They're usually small, fast and good at mimicry. The Galaxy Pocket meets the size requirement, but we'll have to check about the speed. And no, no one will mistake it for a trimmed down S III but some feature phones may be fooled into getting too close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an exaggeration perhaps that the likes of the Galaxy Pocket herald the demise of the dumbphone. But this and other droids in sheep's clothing will just keep on coming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is obviously as basic as a smartphone package gets, but the Galaxy Pocket is still a true droid. It gives users quad-band GSM connectivity and dual-band 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a capacitive, multi-touch enabled screen. It can be a basic music player and a basic camera - and the expandable memory is one of the key features that make the Galaxy Pocket a smart buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're lots of blank spots on its spec sheet, which make it vulnerable to older midrange droids in the same price range, but the Samsung Galaxy Pocket is for learners, not knowers. Convenience and affordability were top priorities, in what Samsung would like to see as the first step towards a long-term commitment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We too are going to look at the Galaxy Pocket one step at a time. As usual, we start with the look and feel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ultra basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket comes in the most modest of boxes. It only offers a single-piece charger and some leaflets. There's no headset in the bundle, and a data cable is missing too - and these are considered essential for the everyday usage. A complimentary microSD card is an outright luxury at this price point.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Living up to its name, the Samsung Galaxy Pocket is a very compact set, though not nearly as tiny as the Sony Ericsson minis. Its very own siblings are a better point of reference. At 103.7 x 57.5 x 12 mm the Pocket is a tad smaller than the Galaxy Mini and almost the same size as the Galaxy Y. The weight of 97 g is about right for a handset that's entirely made of plastic but not remarkably slim.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pocket is based on the same chassis as the Galaxy Y, evidenced by the placement of the connectivity ports, the camera and the loudspeaker. The styling of the Galaxy Pocket is very simple, free of embellishments and somewhat lacking in imagination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's built around a 2.8" display, while the Galaxy Y managed to fit a 3" touchscreen in virtually the same body. The excessive screen bezel doesn't look too great though. Overall, the feel of the Galaxy Y borders on sophisticated in comparison and it's not the best looking of phones to begin with. We are not going to hold the cheap look against the Galaxy Pocket anyway, mostly because it is cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8" TFT display of QVGA (240 x 320) resolution is at the bottom of the barrel in terms of specs, and we're afraid the actual image quality reflects that quite accurately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are highly pixelated, while the low contrast and inadequate brightness make it uncomfortable to use on a bright sunny day. Here's the full rundown below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's how its sunlight legibility stands in comparison. As you can see this is the lowest score we have measured to date, so be warned that you might have a hard time finding a proper angle for working with the Pocket when outside on bright sunny days.

			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We zoomed into the display using our digital microscope so you can get a better idea of how the pixels are arranged, and how big they are. Check it out:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Samsung Galaxy Pocket display matrix compared to the LG Optimus L7 unit</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the usual arrangement of a physical Home button and two capacitive Menu and Back keys. They light up only when touched and otherwise stay out of the way. Above the display there's an earpiece and a proximity sensor to disable the touchscreen during calls. What the phone lacks is a front-facing camera and an ambient light sensor for auto brightness options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Near the top, on the right side of the Galaxy Pocket, which is the usual place in Samsung phones, is the power/lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features a lanyard eyelet and a single-piece volume rocker with reasonably good press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the Galaxy Pocket you'll only find a little slit for removing the battery cover and the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 3.5 mm headphone jack at the top along with a microUSB port, hidden under a plastic cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is plastic (as is the case with most Samsung phones these days) but looks durable and feels nice to the touch. The beveled sides are smooth but the surface within has a fine texture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2 MP camera lens is placed on the left near the top and there's a loudspeaker grille in the center. A Samsung logo is stamped underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover is easy enough and the 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery you'll see underneath is quoted at 500h of stand-by and up to 5 h and 40 minutes of calls in 3G. The Galaxy Pocket usually lasted a day and a half on a charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Galaxy Pocket through our traditional battery test on the Galaxy Pocket. It achieved an endurance rating of 34h, which is quite respectable, given its battery size. You can find the full test over here, while detailed information on how we test is located on this page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hot-swappable microSD card slot is on the side and the SIM compartment is under the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to expect more from the Galaxy Pocket. It looks cheap but feels fairly durable. Securing a competitive price entailed compromises and the low-quality screen is the most obvious of them. The feel of the device is quite plasticky but the textured back cover allows decent grip. The phone is pleasantly compact and meant for those who value ease of use above style and performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread a la TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket is an entry-level phone and ICS is well out of its reach, but Gingerbread 2.3.6 isn't so desperately behind the times. The topping of choice is Samsung's home-baked TouchWiz launcher and the result is quite good, the low resolution and limited screen estate aside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo that will show you the whole thing in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen displays the current date and time, but the notifications are oddly selective. Incoming emails won't be displayed but missed calls and texts will - we guess the limited display size is to blame here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the Galaxy Pocket is unlocked you're greeted by the familiar TouchWiz homescreen. You can have up to seven panes to populate with widgets but you don't have to use all the screens all the time. If you need less, deleting the extra ones will speed up navigation. You can zoom out with a pinch gesture to enter edit mode, where you can add, remove and rearrange the homescreen panes as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area provides a handful of quick toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Sound and screen auto rotation. The rest is left to notifications of missed and ongoing events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button on the homescreen will let you put more content or change the wallpaper. Live wallpapers are supported too, though there are none preinstalled (you can go to Google Play if you want any). The context menu has shortcuts too for search, notifications and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is mostly unchanged in TouchWiz with the exception of the task manager button. The app is accompanied by a homescreen widget, which shows the number of currently active apps and saves you the effort of installing a third-party task killer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically, the app drawer consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in the vanilla Android). With a pinch zoom you can rearrange pages with icons, but there's no easy way to create new pages. Folders aren't supported either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hitting Edit in the context menu lets you change the first three of the four shortcuts visible at the bottom of the screen. The fourth one is fixed as it toggles the app drawer and the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket is a beginner's smartphone and the hardware gives you no reason to expect impressive performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It runs on a single-core 832 MHz ARMv6 processor with 289 MB worth of RAM. Luckily, the low screen resolution makes up for the lack of power, and the handset does OK in day to day tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack tests pure processing speed and the Galaxy Pocket edges both the Galaxy Ace and the Y Duos but fails to beat the HTC Explorer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 tests the GPU of the Galaxy Pocket. The lowly 12.9 frames per second suggest you should stick to less graphically intensive apps if you want anything remotely resembling good performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both SunSpider and BrowserMark show that you can't expect stellar web browsing performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed that the Galaxy Pocket slowed down in memory-card involving scenarios. The Gallery, for one, gave lots of huffs before it could smoothly change images. The browser is another place where lag is evident, even though there is no Flash support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook with a pinch of social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung Galaxy Pocket has unlimited capacity and all the functionality you could want. The application displays contacts stored in the SIM card, your Google account and in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses a tabbed interface, which lets you browse all contacts (with a handy search field), organize contacts into groups, check the call log or view Activities. Activities is where you'll find all recent status updates from your contacts (Facebook and Twitter are supported).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main contact list view hides some useful shortcuts too. Swiping your finger to the right on a name will dial the contact's default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have multiple email accounts and sync options include Exchange. There are many other details that you can assign to each entry, such as numbers, email addresses, IM, organization, etc. Clicking the plus sign on the right adds another field of that type, while the minus sign deletes it. Contacts can be joined too, so you can combine someone's Facebook (or Twitter) account with their main contact entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similarly to the main screen of the phonebook, each contact has a tab for calls, activities and media (online albums go here).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No-worries telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pocket handled calls trouble-free. The reception was consistently good and sound in the earpiece crisp but slightly on the low side. It isn't a deal breaker though. We didn't experience any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works beautifully. Tap a digit and it searches both contact numbers and names containing it. If more than one contact is found, a button with a number and an arrow will display the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Pocket and it got a Below Average score. Keeping this one in a purse or some deep dark pocket can result in missed calls. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging application is quite straightforward. It has a new message button and below it are all the received messages organized in threads. The swipe gestures from the phonebook are enabled here as well (swipe left for message, right for call). Tap and hold on a message or thread to get options such as delete or forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is pretty straightforward. You just start typing the name or number of the recipient and choose from the list of suggestions. If you add multimedia to the message it will automatically be turned into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or use a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. Once a text is copied you can paste it across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you can choose between the standard Gmail app or the generic email app. The Gmail one supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email application is used for all your other non-Google accounts and supports multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz UI in the Galaxy Pocket features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don't need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is the badge on top of the Email icon, which indicates the number of unread messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket comes with the Samsung home-baked keyboard, which isn't particularly comfortable to use due to the limited screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swype is also available on the Galaxy Pocket and we think it's a great option to have on such a small display, once you've gotten used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you rotate the phone sideways, the virtual keyboard automatically switches to the landscape mode, which is a little better. It covers most of the screen however, leaving room for only two lines of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is also available and works quite good if you are in a quieter environment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard gallery and basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket comes with the stock Android gallery. It only shows a downsized version of your images, which isn't that insufferable in the case of the Galaxy Pocket and its 2 MP photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos from different folders in the built-in and microSD storage appear in different sub-galleries. Online Picasa albums are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize the photos by date via a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view. In grid view, there's a date slider, which can also be used to display photos chronologically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to multi-touch support pinch zooming is also enabled on the Galaxy Pocket but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons. Zooming and panning are pretty smooth but there's no kinetic scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player found on the Galaxy Pocket is quite simple. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The player only manages 3GP and MP4 videos at low resolution. Even 480p videos seemed to be a problem. There's no subtitle support either but at this price range we really can't complain.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket uses the TouchWiz music player. It sorts the music in a tabbed interface and applies various filters such as current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen is dominated by the album art. You can swipe sideways to skip tracks from the current playlist back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer support lets you enhance the music experience on the Galaxy Pocket. There's also a 5.1 channel virtualization option available when you plug in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stereo FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play the radio through the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket did quite well in our audio quality test, which came as a nice surprise to us. One would think that when you are pursuing the lowest possible price tag audio output would be one of the first areas where compromises are made, but the Pocket is not cutting corners in this department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Galaxy Pocket show its full potential and achieve impressive scores all over the field. It's not the loudest smartphone you can find, but everything else about its output is as good as it should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when headphones come into play consists of a moderate hike in stereo crosstalk, and some extra intermodulation distortion. None of those readings is bad enough to be alarming though, and the other scores are once again great so the overall performance is way better than the price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket uses a very basic 2 MP camera with fixed focus. It's good for 1600 x 1200 resolution stills and offers geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app user interface is touch-friendly and has built-in features such as smile shot, preset scenes, geotagging, effects, on-screen gridline and panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pocket isn't a cameraphone by any means. The photos that came out offer very little detail, which gets poorer and poorer towards the edges. Colors look washed out and the automatic white balance isn't particularly good when lighting is not at its best - using some of the presets might be a better option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the samples below to get an idea of the quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video is barely worth mentioning<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording must've been way down on the list of priorities when the Galaxy Pocket was designed. The Pocket offers QVGA at 15 fps, which is practically unusable, except for the occasional MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched QVGA@15fps sample for direct download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good connectivity within budget<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pocket is ready for worldwide roaming with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band 3G with HSDPA download rates of up to 3.6 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity package also offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Bluetooth 3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. GPS is on the list too, with A-GPS connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket packs a generous 3 GB of internal storage but it comes with no memory card in the box. It still supports microSD cards of up to 32 GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can use your favorite headphones with the Galaxy Pocket hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Low-end browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Gingerbread browser usually offers a great mobile browsing experience. But on the 2.8" low-quality screen you'll need a lot of patience to go through a page or read an article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface elements are away from sight, which leaves what little screen real estate there is to the web page. Once the page finishes loading, all you see is the status bar on top of the screen as the address bar hides automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The context menu is where a lot of the functionality is hidden. From here, you can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pocket's browser supports three zoom methods - virtual buttons, double tap and multi-touch pinch-zooming. The browser also supports text reflow, which is essential on such a low-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's bookmark list that shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a "most visited" list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket has the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash support. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but you have to live without them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing capabilities of Android have soared in the past couple of years. And as with most Galaxy smartphones, the Galaxy Pocket is equipped with all the essential apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the calendar app, it has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pocket comes with Polaris View preinstalled. It's a viewer-only version of the Polaris Office app found in higher-end Samsung phones. The app can open Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents (both Office 2003 and 2007 versions) and view PDFs too. There's Box.net integration so you can store your docs in the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator, alarm clock and voice recorder among other apps preinstalled on the Galaxy Y Pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get the Samsung-made Notes and My Files apps. The first one has not changed since Galaxy S times and is very comfortable to use - you can scribble notes easily, choose different colors for your notes and more. The My Files application is a file manager that can give you access to the entire file system of your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voice recorder is another app that comes preinstalled on the Galaxy Pocket. You can record as many sound clips as you like and the only limitation is the memory you have on your device. The list tab shows all of your recordings sorted by date.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket packs a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about under a minute with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up, but requires an Internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the app of choice and offers the latest touch optimizations like the two finger rotation and tilt, it also features navigation, search for POIs and much more. Street view is, of course, part of the package too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps comes complete with Navigation, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though (not all countries have the option), and it relies on Internet connection for the initial route planning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you'll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pocket doesn't come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket has the latest version of the Android Market - now called Google Play. The new name and icon aside there aren't major changes to the look of the app store. In select countries, aside from apps you'll also find music, movies and books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should keep in mind that not all apps will be compatible with the low-res screen and the relatively old CPU. ICS-only apps are pretty rare for now, so the OS version shouldn't be an issue.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No smartphones beyond this point. Lost so far in no-man's land between Symbian and Android, the point in question has been flagged on the map. Welcome to checkpoint Pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pocket is a beginner's package. Be it screen resolution and size, processing power or imaging, smartphone specs don't get any more basic than that. To be fair though, smartphones almost never cost as little either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the low-end of the smartphone market is brimming with Android devices, you're still going to have a hard time finding one as affordable as the Galaxy Pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer is one of the few that will try and match the Pocket price tag. The compact smartphone with plenty of youth appeal offers a 3.2" HVGA display, a 3.15 MP camera with superior video recording and the Sense UI experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Explorer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the devices to come to the market more recently, the LG Optimus L3 E400 is an almost exact match for the Galaxy Pocket. It has roughly the same size but offers a bigger 3.2" screen of the same QVGA resolution. It goes for a 3.15 MP camera and definitely looks better, which may as well justify the slightly higher asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus L3 E400</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a way, the Galaxy Pocket isn't supposed to be compared to other smartphones. It's hardly a surprise that it gets beaten every time. On the other hand, feature phones can be a tough competition too. And we don't mean the feature-rich dumbphones. The old-fashioned buttoned sets are a major threat because proper texting still rates high in the Pocket's price range and demographic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That makes the Asha 302 a potential rival but Nokia obviously look beyond QWERTY messengers and Touch-and-Type phones as their line of defense against the invasion of cheap smartphones.
