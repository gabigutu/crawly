		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC burst right onto the dual-core scene with a phone that's set to be an Android sensation. They've gone all out with the design of that one - from screen, through camera to the powerful chipset. No cutting corners, no compromise on features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has a flair for big names but Sensation sure is something else. The name simply sticks. We're talking a monster 4.3" S-LCD screen with qHD resolution (540 x 960). If the bump in resolution doesn?t mean much to you, picture this ? the Sensation?s 4.3-inch screen has the same pixel density as a much smaller 3.7" screen with regular WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon chipset with the new Adreno 220 graphics bodes no good for rivals. But hey, that's the news we've been waiting for. A battle is brewing and dual-core domination is the prize.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we let the excitement of benchmarks cloud our minds, let's get the laundry list out of the way. Here's what the HTC Sensation has to offer and what didn?t work all that well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll notice that "unibody" is not on the feature list - the back cover is certainly interesting but this is by no means a unibody. Let's not let that sully the great impression though - the Sensation is one of the most powerful droids around and it's on the shortlist if you're looking for the ultimate in smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera with 1080p video recording begs for a camera shootout. And the high-res S-LCD unit calls for another display test. So that's a lot of testing we have ahead of us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But before we get busy, we need to give credit where it's due. HTC have been perfecting their interface designs for years and the latest Sense UI 3.0 is laced with equal amounts of useful features and eye candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 02.08.2011: We've added a video summary of this review in the conclusion - check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all the tests and benchmarks that await us, we just have to let the HTC Sensation out of the box. That's exactly what we do on the next page and then go on to check out the hardware.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: nothing out of the usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation comes in a ordinary looking box and there's nothing surprising about its contents. A compact charger connects to the provided microUSB cable to fill the battery. There's also a nice single-piece headset with music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only real perk in the package is the 8GB microSD card, which comes inserted in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no MHL dongle in the package - you'll have to buy one yourself if you want to enjoy streaming HD video. Other MHL-enabled devices don't come with MHL dongles either, so this didn?t surprise us much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Sensation 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation measures 126.1 x 65.4 x 11.3 mm and weighs 148 g. It's very close to the dimensions of other phones with 4.3" screens, though thicker and heavier than some.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's hard to deny that HTC make some attractive looking handsets and the Sensation is good enough proof. It just isn't a prime example. We can understand their need to freshen up the design and set the new flagship aside. But the end result is questionable - and not what we'd call unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's curves on the back, curves on the front, curves all around - from the metal plate on the back that extends to wrap around the edges of the phone - to the screen, yep the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation comes with a 4.3? Gorilla glass protected S-LCD screen. It seems concave because the edges of the screen curve upwards but most of the surface of the display is perfectly flat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen some very good S-LCD units from HTC and while the one on the Sensation is okay, it has its issues. Viewing angles are less than perfect - contrast is quickly lost when you tilt the phone and colors get slightly off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, blacks are not as deep as AMOLED screens go but brightness and color rendering are good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is acceptable - though obviously failed by the reflective screen coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the results of our now traditional display brightness and contrast test. Deep blacks are not the Sensation's strength and while the brightness levels are OK, the contrast ratios aren?t terribly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we have the proximity and ambient light sensors to the left of the earpiece and the VGA video call camera on the right. Under the earpiece grill hides a small status LED (on the right).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find four capacitive keys. The haptic enabled controls are well spaced and very responsive. The keys (Home, Menu, back and search) have extra functionality upon a long-press (task switcher, virtual keyboard, voice search).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sensation is occupied by the microUSB port and the volume rocker. The volume rocker is quite thin but comfortable enough to use. The microUSB port is left uncovered and it also serves as a charger port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a MHL port and not strictly speaking a microUSB port - though it looks and works like one. Plug in a MHL dongle however and the MHL port transforms into HDMI out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, there's nothing - you weren?t hoping for a shutter key, were you?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack (left uncovered) and the Power/Lock key, which is easy enough to press when you want but secure against accidental taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece. There's also a small latch that lets you pop the phone out of its back cover. That's right, the phone comes out of the back cover, not the other way around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sensation features the 8MP camera and the dual-LED flash right next to it. The area around the camera protrudes slightly and the camera lens is set quite deep, giving it very good protection against scratches and fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The protruding frame around the lens also helps to keep the loudspeaker from getting muffled when you place the phone on a level surface. It's not entirely successful but the sound is still pretty clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back plate consists of three parts ? a metal piece in the middle and two parts of soft rubbery plastic either side. Each has different finish - looks like patched together and might not be to everyone's taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the back cover houses the antennas for the HTC Sensation - remove the cover and the phone loses all Wi-Fi signal. It's unusually susceptible too to the so-called "death grip" as our tests confirmed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, you don?t even need a grip to attenuate the antennas - place the phone flat on the palm of your hand and the phone loses a few notches of Wi-Fi signal. In fact, touching the area around the camera and loudspeaker can reduce the Wi-Fi signal to zero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cell network antenna also has death grip issues - they're not as bad but your hands around the bottom of the device will cause the signal to weaken. It's nothing to worry about if the signal is strong enough, but in areas of typically poor reception it can make the difference between having and dropping the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the back cover is the microSD card slot (easily how-swappable once you open the phone) and the SIM card compartment, which is blocked by the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is a 1520mAh Li-Ion unit with a little over 14 days of standby (in 2G, over 16 days in 3G) and over 8 hours of talk time (in 2G, nearly 7 hours in 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation is a solidly built phone - we didn?t get a unibody, but there's a good amount of metal on the phone. We also liked the Gorilla glass that curves at the edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation is a bit thick and heavy compared to other phones with similarly sized screens, but we do like phones that have some heft to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC fans will love the Sensation, though others might find it a bit hard to tell apart from its HTC siblings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI and Gingerbread out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation comes with Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread and version 3.0 of the HTC Sense. Gingerbread should be familiar enough to you, but after HTC's customizations you'd barely recognize it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.0 edition of the Sense UI isn't all that different from the versions that came out just before the Sensation (that would be the Incredible S and Desire S). There is some cool new stuff though as this video will demonstrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well done to HTC for the new lockscreen. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC Sensation comes with six different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen just shows the ring, four shortcuts, the time and the homescreen wallpaper. Then there's the Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Friend Stream widget which shows SNS updates from your friends and the Weather widget which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations. There's Stocks too - with quotes flying up or down, again, in eye-pleasing 3D. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 11 clock widgets you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you can't download new lockscreens from HTC Hub. Not yet anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beyond the lockscren<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the Sense homescreen. There, we meet a scroll arc at the bottom that is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with HTC proprietary Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but the customization goes deep ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and use different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetically, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There's a list layout, where two-finger alphabet scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are thirteen different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold of the Home button works too. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled on the HTC Sensation but it won?t work if you have removed the battery ? in that case it will do a regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before turning the phone off, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC use some sort of Suspend or Hibernate routine as seen in regular computers to implement the fast boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation has a 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon chipset with Adreno 220 graphics beating in its chest, which should put it on equal footing with the Samsung Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The higher-res screen puts it at a disadvantage though as the GPU has to push out 35% more pixels that the competition. That, and the new Snapdragon chipset still uses Scorpion cores, which are getting old and there's "only" 768MB RAM, which might show in some tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's see what the benchmarks tell us. We had some problems with a few of the benchmarks (they didn?t work in full screen or crashed on all phones), so we couldn?t include them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi is CPU-intensive but it's not designed for dual-cores so the older CPU architecture shows clearly. Linpack on the other hand is based on a benchmark for supercomputers so it makes perfect use of all the cores it can get - the faster the better too. The Sensation is pretty much tied with the Galaxy S II here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant has a 3D performance component and the Sensation is at a disadvantage here. The amount of RAM seems irrelevant to this test: the Optimus 2X only has 512MB RAM but isn't at a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both in-browser benchmarks that we ran show the HTC Sensation lagging behind. Now, HTC has put a custom Flash player (as they usually do) in the browser but that can't be it - SunSpider is pure JavaScript. Anyway, HTC has plenty of optimization work to do in the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have some GLBenchmark 2.0 results too, which show that the Adreno 220 does okay but is behind the Mali-400MP of the Galaxy S II. The Optimus 2X is not included since it didn?t have enough results in the GLBenchmark database and the benchmark kept crashing on our unit, so we couldn?t test it ourselves either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense-ible phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sensation has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages between you and the given contact in a conversation layout. The third tab is a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what turns the Sensation into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Sensation. The Transfer app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dialing, reception issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC Sensation has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already covered the death grip issues of the Sensation, but the reception is okay most of the time. You can experience issues in areas of poor signal though, especially if you?re touching the bottom of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation knows some accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call while placing it down starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Sensation fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Good mark putting it somewhere in the middle among its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Refined messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Sensation are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Sensation boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the 4.3? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app features several tabs that let you filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Sensation lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery has new clothes, still cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery has changed - it now stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC Sensation is very straightforward ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube. You could use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sensation supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does DivX/XviD, has limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing. There's no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox if you have it installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Sensation offers a full screen toggle (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through videos. SRS sound enhancement is also available but there?s no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general - 1080p MP4 videos were no problem. The player handled some 720p DivX or XviD videos. However, it was picky about which videos it would play and which it wouldn?t - especially when dealing with HD clips or large files. There's no MKV or subtitle support either, which was disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too ? the Sensation can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable. The Sensation needs some work in this department though, if we're to accept it as a proper portable HD video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player gets better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased (at least our unit had, which featured a Vodafone music shop).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dropdown at the top of the screen lets you switch between your library on the phone and DLNA media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation offers SRS sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. If you plug in headphones, you can change equalizer settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the bar at the top of the screen that says "HTC Sensation" lets you play the song on another device wirelessly - either over DLNA or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on the lockscreen that lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). The card also shows the album art and name of the song and artist. You can flip the card - it's backside shows album art and track info too, but lacks music controls. That's not particularly useful but is good eye candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app ? SoundHound. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is good, but slow to start<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that annoyed us about the radio is that it takes quite a while to start and stop ? about five seconds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation is among the best droids in terms of audio output quality. Loud and clear, the smartphone is basically perfect when used with an external amplifier (like a car audio or home stereo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the good news is those things remain pretty impressive even after you plug in a pair of headphones. The intermodulation distortion is the only part of its performance to go below average, while the stereo crosstalk and frequency response only take minor hits. Sadly, volume levels decrease with headphones, but it's not too bad really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera has its highs and lows<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 1080p video @ 30fps. There?s a dual-LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom lever on the left. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation has touch focus and face detection; geotagging is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is enabled too which is good to have on a phone like the Sensation with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have the right focus is to tap and hold the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other image effects too. For example, Warp places a control point on the screen, which you can drag with your finger and see the result in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depth of field is another such effect ? it adds a radius slider besides the control point and will blur everything in the photo that falls outside the circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, image quality is a traditional weak spot for HTC phones and the Sensation is no exception. Despite its 8MP resolution, the captured detail isn't all that much - noise reduction is trying too hard at times to offset a noisy image sensor - and although contrast is good, the colors are oftentimes way off. And oversharpening is present throughout all samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand if you don't need the full 8MP resolution (an let's be honest - most of us don't) then the results are quite acceptable. And the HTC Sensation probably has the best camera we've seen come from HTC. Most other 8 megapixel smartphones, however, are better than it. The Sensation comes close to the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc, but the Galaxy S II and the Optimus 2X are better in still pics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we've got a bunch of samples below and we plan to do an 8 megapixel showdown quite soon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 8MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation is a lot harder on image noise than most other 8 megapixel phones, so its images come out cleaner, but the finest detail gets smeared. Oversharpening is another defect that is easily noticeable. Portraits of people however come out with more pleasing skin tones</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video recording is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change even if you get closer or move back. Still, the Sensation had no problems focusing at even very close distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in .3GP, which isn't the ideal container for HD video, especially 1080p. Ask the LG Optimus 2X, if you don?t believe us. Still, the Sensation camera boasts stereo audio recording at 44kHz, which is a huge improvement over the sub-22kHz mono sound that, say, the LG Optimus 2X or Samsung Galaxy S II record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the image quality of the videos is nothing to shout about. The FullHD videos have less detail than the 720p footage recorded with the iPhone 4, let alone matching the Galaxy S II sharpness. Still they are smooth, with no doubled frames and have pleasing colors so it's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos captured are doing better for their class. In fact they are almost on par with the 1080p footage and really, the higher-res videos won?t give you much in terms of increased resolved detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample 1080p@30fps video clip (13.8MB) and a 720p@30fps clip (10.4MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience. Don't forget to click 1080p on the FullHD video sample and open the video fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the HTC Sensation in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 1080p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This test shows curious results - the camera seems to have potential but the low-bitrate (around 10Mbps) takes its toll on the fine detail. Still, it manages to put up a good fight in our studio test and both phones qualify well ahead of the Optimus 2X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has many features, death grip issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation has a complete connectivity set. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast dual-band 3G: 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are death grip issues though - the Wi-Fi radio is especially prone to it. It can be reduced to zero when you touch the top part of the back of the phone. We tested the issue extensively, and we?re not the only ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cell network signal is more resilient though touching the bottom of the phone might cause trouble in areas with poor reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connected media app handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? it plays media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the gallery have such functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices (default Froyo app maxes out at 5), you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not over covering the connectivity - the "microUSB port" as we called it for convenience is actually a MHL port. If you plug a MHL dongle in it, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV - the qHD resolution has the perfect 16:9 aspect ratio for connecting to HDTVs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did a quick test using the MHL adapter from Samsung that we used to test the Galaxy S II - and it worked. This was good to see as we wondered about compatibility of MHL accessories across different makers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser, plays HD Flash videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser, plenty of processing power and a large, high-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like find on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation's browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation has full Flash support and YouTube videos up to 720p played quite smoothly. 1080p however proves too much for the browser and the video gets extremely choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We even decided to try out a few Flash games and they worked fine as well. You can play the Flash content in full screen and landscape mode, which makes the most out of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fully-featured organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Sensation, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents but not 2007 docs. Oddly, you can edit existing Office 2007 docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of Polaris gives less editing options than we're used to - you can do copy, cut and paste, then apply bold, italic and underline styles and highlight text and that's it. There used to be font style options here but now they're inexplicably gone. You can't edit formulas in Excel spreadsheets either, which is a major stumbling block for doing Office document editing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Sensation into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two handy search apps: Quick lookup and Search Anywhere. Quick lookup lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatter for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Show me app is great for those who are new to HTC Sense or even Android itself. It lets you download How-To articles on various topics, which will help the user if they don't know how to do something.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which let you post on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (yet another way to talk to your friends) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into the likes of Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android also comes preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (they both integrate with the phonebook so you don?t have to actually start the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app is the latest version too ? tweets can be geotagged, you can snap a photo to include in the tweet straight in the app (uploaded automatically to yfrog or TwitPic) and there are handy buttons to reply to or retweet a message.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It can read eBooks too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Reader app is an eBook reader provided by Kobo. It comes preloaded with several classics (from A Tale of Two Cities to White Fang) and access to Kobo?s eBook store where you can buy new books (the store has free titles too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is fairly simple ? the library displays as a list of book-cover thumbs or as a simple list. Once you tap on a cover, it opens up the book for you with a nice animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reader formats the book to best fit the screen and you can adjust the font or pinch to zoom. You can add bookmarks, highlight sections of the book with different colors and even jot down notes ? you can access those in the context menu while reading the book. Also helpful is the Quick lookup shortcut, which is great if you need to lookup a word in the dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice addition that was missing from earlier versions is the Reading scene - it offers four presets for font color/background color, so you can read more comfortably. The default is black on white, but there's Light orange and Light yellow too, and Night, which is black on white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we missed is the option to import e-books you already have ? like classic books from Project Guttenberg for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, some will find the Reader app useful, others can just grab Kindle for Android from the Market or one of the other free eBook readers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market, HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.), so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option to display all apps in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Sensation contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Sensation in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Navigation: it's the Google way, or the HTC way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in a minute and 10 seconds (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation also comes with HTC Places, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (provider of the software) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate new routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t (it can only reroute you, not calculate a new route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free. You can always pay for a voice-guided navigation license too - it's cheaper than buying a dedicated GPS unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, 02.08.2011: We've recently started making video versions of our trademark reviews. The video reviews summarize our review findings and are generally less technical and easier to swallow. So here it is, the HTC Sensation video review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have loaded the Sensation with so many features, we ran out of breath to cover them all. And from a distance, in another person's hand this handsome droid looks great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But how did it feel to actually use it? Well, it has its ups and downs. The death grip issue made a negative impression, without being a complete show-stopper. Anyway, we shouldn?t let that spoil our enjoyment of an otherwise impressively spec'd phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the build of the HTC Sensation (although the "unibody" didn?t turn out to be what we expected). And the latest Sense UI version will make your head spin - there's just so much functionality and eye-candy. We felt like kids in a candy store when we started testing the Sensation. Plus, with Android 2.3 Gingerbread underneath you know you have Android's latest and greatest at your fingertips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Sensation was below the mark in some areas compared to the competition. Synthetic benchmarks may not always tell the whole story but they say that two Scorpion cores at 1.2GHz are sometimes slower than some more advanced cores. And the 3D graphics are somewhat behind too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the not-so-good stills and video do tarnish the high-end gloss of the HTC Sensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But all those downsides don't mean a thing unless the competition can do better. So, can it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is the obvious alternative - it's powered by a 1.2GHz dual-core too. But the camera does better, the 4.3" SuperAMOLED Plus is brilliant and the chipset (that is CPU, GPU and RAM) is faster in benchmarks. It's also amazingly thin and light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 2X is another option - its chipset holds its own against the competition and the camera is better. Plus, it's been out for a while now and it has the price advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix fits the bill too with a 1GHz dual-core CPU and a qHD screen. It has a 5MP/720p camera but the docks make it unique, especially the laptop dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II ? LG Optimus 2X ? Motorla Atrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a duo of dual-core droids with 3D screens and cameras if you're interested in that. The LG Optimus 3D has high novelty factor (that's for sure) and so does the HTC EVO 3D (a CDMA-only model for now, but the GSM version has sort of been officially confirmed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Optimus 3D ? HTC EVO 3D CDMA</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's it for the dual-cores - they're still quite rare. But there's an excellent selection of single-core droids with 4+ inch screens and 8MP stills and HD video recording. Here are a few picks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    HTC Desire HD ? HTC Incredible S ? Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc ? Samsung i997 Infuse 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, HTC Sensation - yay or nay? It is a very good phone but just a little short in its bid to claim the Android crown. And as usual, as most HTC phones, it?s on the expensive side. But then again, the Sensation is by no means a phone you're likely to regret. Though we doubt it will live up to its grand name.</paragraph>
