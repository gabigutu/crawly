			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's the third - and last - of our series of articles charting the evolution of mobile phones. After checking on the way form factors have changed over time and remembering all those devices that the cell phones killed, it's now time to focus on the features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ten years ago a 4-row display was something to boast about and MP3 ringtones sounded crazy sexy cool. Yet nowadays we frown at HVGA screens and consider 3 megapixel cameras to be old hat. It's amazing how far we've come, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for our final trip down memory lane, we will be checking out how it all happened. When did all those features appear, what was the fate of their pioneers and to what extent are they considered important nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will be focusing on the time it took for each of those features to get widely adopted. You know pretty much every one of the features we now expect from every mid-range or low-end phone out there was once an exclusive treat, available only to the chosen few. Not even SMS was always around, let alone Bluetooth or card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again we should be thanking you, our dear readers, because once again the story we are about to tell is written by you. Millions of people coming and going through our website through the years have left valuable feedback that clearly indicates what's fashionable and what's not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin we would like to point out a couple of facts that it's useful to remember when looking at the data that follows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, back in the old days we used to put down only the phones' announcement date in the database and not the actual launch date. So you may notice a certain time shift in the charts. For instance, a large number of 2003 models were popular in 2004, because it was when they were actually available. That shouldn't be a problem though, the info is still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Secondly, we've broken down the raw data into two types of averages. With the absolute averages every cellphone model has the same statistical importance (same weight). The second type, the weighted average, accounts for the fact that models have different importance (varied weight) depending on their popularity (measured by user hits).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put it simply - touchscreen phones have a simple average of 20% of all phones in 2008, but a weighted average of 35%. The absolute average tells us that of all phones, one in five was a touch phone, which is a generally unimpressive share. But this same year touch phones generated one third of all the hits on our phone database - indicated by the weighted average. They were the most popular (and potentially the most high-end) models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind though, that the weighted average is skewed towards the more expensive phones, since those generate a disproportionately higher amount of traffic. You know people are not fascinated by run-of-the-mill handsets. They don't look them up online, they don't research them - they simply use them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay so now that we have this one covered, let's see what the stats can tells us. We've broken down the most important phone features each in its own chapter and we're going to be investigating how this feature has evolved through the years.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3G connectivity and HSDPA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ah, the ever-growing demand for faster network data transfers. Because let's face it, few people actually use video-calling and faster internet connection is all that fuel the 3G (and the upcoming 4G) fire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the first 3G networks appearing in Japan at the very beginning of the decade (2001), it took until 2003 for the first handsets supporting the new network standard to appear in Europe. The Nokia 6650 was the most notable announcement back in the day, but Sony Ericsson quickly caught up with the Z1010.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6650 ? Sony Ericsson Z1010</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever since, 3G connectivity has been a sought-after feature, which explains its high weighted average. Back when it first appeared you needed to dig pretty deep in your pockets to get one of the 3G-capable phones. Today you can get one for less than 50 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's only that low-end mobile phone users neither need nor are willing to pay for cellular network data transfers so getting such a device doesn't make much sense for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However as those data rates continue to fall an increasing number of people are embracing the chance to constantly stay in touch. And the more you do that, the more you realize that the fastest transfer speeds are a necessity rather than a luxury extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And so as mobile phones evolved and were able to give a desktop-like experience for more and more internet-related tasks, HSDPA stepped in. The share of HSDPA-supporting models was pretty low at first, but they quickly caught up and now almost every 3G handset has HSDPA too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is, even this year 3G handsets account for less than half the entries in our database (though they do generate more than half of all hits). But the reason behind this is not some out of this world manufacturing cost. On the contrary - 3G radios are pretty cheap to include. It's all about product differentiation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the growth slowing down it seems that we will need quite a few more years before 3G handsets (or HSDPA ones) reach 100%. And obviously this is not going to happen until every country has a 3G network.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WLAN<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi is the second must-have connectivity feature for today. WLAN came to mobile phones a year later than 3G but is present on an almost equal number of contemporary devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And chances are Wi-Fi will even outdo 3G if the current trends keep up. Just think about it - two years ago 37.5% of all mobile phones in our database had UMTS support, while only 19.6% packed Wi-Fi connectivity. Now those numbers stand at 48.9 and 40.0 respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Initially Wi-Fi integration in mobile phones was slowed by three major factors. The high manufacturing costs were the first hindrance. Next was the high battery drain and last was the inability of mobile phones to make best use of the fast connectivity. But despite all those difficulties, handsets like the Nokia 9500 were pretty popular as far back as 2004.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 9500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The communicator was certainly an exciting piece of technology for its time but it always remained a niche device. The hard task of bringing Wi-Fi to the masses fell on a bunch of more compact and traditionally shaped devices, which appeared the following year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 and Motorola A910 were the most successful of the bunch, but we mustn't also forget the Nokia Eseries, which were born at the end of that same year with the E60, E61 and E70. Plus there was also a bunch of PocketPCs that also tried their luck but none of them did quite so well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N91 ? Motorola A910 ? Nokia E61 ? Nokia E70</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the main driving forces behind the growing popularity of WLAN are the high prices of the cellular data plans and the recently high penetration of Wi-Fi access points for public and home use. An unlimited data plan with decent speed may be the best in terms of flexibility but it is certainly more expensive to support. So a good number of users would rather spend a few dollars extra on a WLAN handset upfront and use their home and office Wi-Fi networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus Wi-Fi is much more comfortable if you need to download larger files as it usually offers speeds superior to any HSPA network. And that's now, before the new N standard reaches the mass market. Once midrange mobile phones catch up with the Wireless N connectivity of phones such as the iPhone 4, the Galaxy S and the likes, Wi-Fi will become an even hotter commodity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a much greater range and even higher speeds (though we will need more processing power to make use of that) the N standard will let you get a bit further away from your WLAN access point. At the moment though the current wireless standards and the weakness of phone antennas mean you can't stray far from the access point, and that does somewhat take the fun out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But much like 3G, the thing that will make more users demand WLAN in their next handset is the increased number of desktop-like tasks that smartphones can perform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see it's all rather complicated. All parts need to stay balanced or else the evolution is totally pointless.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bluetooth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike WLAN, Bluetooth was intended for usage in mobile phones since day one. Ericsson invented it as a way of bypassing the data cables and trying to avoid all the disadvantages Wi-Fi had initially.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was much cheaper to produce and uses less battery juice so it naturally found its way into mobile phones much earlier on. However the first couple of Bluetooth versions were plagued by a lot of bugs so it wasn't all roses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth was a multi-purpose technology - it could be used to swap files but it could also be put to use into wireless headsets. Sure, they were mono at first but newer versions fixed that oversight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally it was Ericsson that also came up with the first handset to support Bluetooth built-in. The honor was granted to the T36 flip-down and later to the T39 and the extremely successful T68.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Ericsson T36 ? Ericsson T39 ? Ericsson T68</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia were next to give Bluetooth a try with the 6310 coming in 2001 and the 7650 following next year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6310 ? Nokia 7650</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When things moved to Bluetooth v2.0 however it was Samsung who had the head-start with the E500. The Koreans are also the ones that lead the Bluetooth v3.0 charge with their Galaxy S lineup and the S8500 Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samaung E500 ? Samsung I9000 Galaxy S ? Samsung S8500 Wave</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is not limited to mobile phones though, some wireless computer keyboards and mice use it too. With proper support from the phone's OS you could enjoy typing on a full-sized keyboard (or on a small portable keyboard you carry in your pocket).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the graph, Bluetooth-enabled devices have been growing in popularity very quickly since 2001. In 2005 they already accounted for half of all mobile phones and that included virtually every noteworthy handset out there. This explains why the weighted average for Bluetooth that year stands at over 82% - it's a feature people really wanted to have and manufacturers were happy to provide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year Bluetooth has reached a weighted average of 99%, which officially makes it a part of the standard mobile phone equipment. There is still a small percentage of phones being released without it, but chances are you will never end up buying one if you are reading this web site.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Infrared port<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The infrared port is like the great-grandfather of Bluetooth. Just the mention of that name brings back some sweet old memories - even if you're not that old. Unlike the other features in this article, the infrared port has already been rendered obsolete and is about to disappear as a phone feature altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is easy to see from the chart that the IrDA ports already were a strong presence at the beginning of the decade when this site was created (Several Nokia handsets spored the feature as far back as 1998 and so did a couple of Ericsson phones and the Alcatel OT COM). They were also a pretty cool feature to have, often providing the only data transfer connection between two mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 6110 ? Nokia 9000 Communicator ? Ericsson S 868 ? Alcatel OT COM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This explains its pretty high weighted average, reaching more than 60% in its prime in 2003. That year most top-notch devices (Nokia 6600, 6230 and Sony Ericsson T610 immediately spring to mind) listed infrared port as one of their key features. However the following year saw the popularity boom of Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones and that essentially made IrDA a piece of hardware to have on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson T610 ? Nokia 6600 ? Nokia 6230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IrDA was also the first wire-free way to tether your laptop - it's slow, but back then mobile Internet access meant dial-up so that didn't stop it. Bluetooth took over that role but it's quickly being edged out by Wi-Fi - turning your phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot is by far the best way to use your phone's Internet connection on your laptop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The life of IrDA was somewhat artificially prolonged by remote control applications but we all know where this is leading. With the inevitable extinction fast approaching, the Nokia N900 is likely the last major handset that came with an IrDA port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don't get fooled by the high weighted average of the Infrared port after 2004. This is only due to the fact that only the best-equipped handsets could afford to allocate space for it. After all, at the time an all-in-one handset was bulky enough for the infrared port to make little difference. So those fully equipped smartphones did generate a lot of interest but virtually none of it was due to the IrDA connectivity itself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>microUSB port<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is one of the best things that has ever happened (and is still happening) to mobile phones. But not so much because of the port specifics themselves (though the slim profile and the life of 10000 insertion and removal cycles do sound impressive). What makes microUSB so special is the fact that all major manufacturers agreed to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have forgotten here's how things worked before that. If you happened to have two or more mobile phones, you would usually need a different charger for each and a separate data cable for every device, which most probably wouldn't charge your device. And then when you change one of those handsets, you wouldn't be able to use the old cables as they were incompatible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact manufacturers liked it that way since they got a cut out of the accessories sales as well. The microUSB port offered USB connectivity, sound and charging along with a slim profile, so when the European Commision demanded that manufacturers unite around a common connectivity port, it wasn't surprising that they picked microUSB out of all proprietary options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola was first to use the microUSB port in their phones starting with their Q 9h smartphone and later on with the V8 and V9 RAZR devices. Then Nokia followed suit and with BlackBerry and the Korean companies joining the party in the 2008 and 2009 it was settled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola Q 9h ? Motorola RAZR2 V8 ? Motorla RAZR2 V9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even Sony Ericsson is starting to give up on its FastPort nowadays and is going microUSB with at least some of its phones. Apple is the only major player nowadays that still refuses to give microUSB a chance but they seem to insist on their closed eco system of devices, software and accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even Apple will go the microUSB way (in Europe anyway) - they've signed the EU agreement for a single charger standard along other big players. The agreement will come into effect in 2011 and all new phones sold in Europe will use microUSB for charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The US doesn't yet have such an agreement coming into effect soon - Apple and RIM are not very keen on the idea, but unless they plan to manufacture two separate devices for the US and Europe, they just will have to go through with it eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course every transition takes its time but the microUSB adoption is downright impressive. The share of devices sporting the new standard doubles every year after its announcement, surpassing 50% in 2010. What's more the weighted average figure tells us that those 51.8% of devices are actually 83% of all devices worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the trend continues in a couple of years all this fragmentation will be gone worldwide. You would need one cable for all your mobile phones, which will do for both charging and data transfers. Here's hoping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing we can see as a potential obstacle to the microUSB universal adoption is its poor music reproduction quality. We saw a few attempts by different manufacturers to use the microUSB slot as a headphones connector too, but apparently you just can't get an audio output that's clean enough through that port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So on high-end devices microUSB goes hand in hand with a standard 3.5mm audio jack, which leads us onto our next chapter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3.5mm audio jack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With dedicated MP3 player being around for such a long time, one might wonder why 3.5mm jacks weren't implemented much earlier. You know - why did we have to wait for Nokia N91 in 2005 for the standard audio jack to debut on mobile phones?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is 3.5mm audio jacks only make sense for listening to music and before that no handset was particularly good for that task. They had neither good enough audio output nor enough storage space. And the N91 was a real game changer, showing that a mobile phone can fully replace your MP3 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And ever since then there was no turning back. Everyone wanted a 3.5 jack on their next handset and it's no coincidence that each year the share of those mobiles has roughly doubled. With storage space cost falling drastically and minimization of other hardware allowing more space for a larger battery the mobile phones are starting to look more and more as a threat to dedicated music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that makes the 3.5mm audio jack a necessity rather than an extra. So this year 3.5mm audio jack-enabled devices might account to just under half of all announcements, but that is the half that generates nearly 90% of all hits on our website. We sure hope that in two years time audio jacks won't be a feature to boast about, but something that goes without saying.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Card slots and microSD cards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>More storage space is what everyone wants nowadays with multimedia files so easy to consume on any average phone. How else can you explain the ever-growing popularity of the card slots over the past ten years?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of those were available more than 10 years ago but for obvious reasons they were the minority back then. With MP3 and video playback yet not invented and applications not even considered there was little you could do with the extra megabytes those first expansion slots gave you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated version of the first Nokia communicator - 9110 was the first handset to pack a memory expansion slot. Its standard of choice was the now forgotten MMC. In 2002 we also saw the first Memory Stick supporting device, the Sony Ericsson P800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 9110i Communicator ? Sony Ericsson P800</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now as smartphones are starting to get a firmer and firmer grip on the market, we are moving into gigabytes territory and expansion slots are becoming more and more vital. For they give you the flexibility and increased store that internal memory cannot provide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If 32GB aren't enough for you, you can just carry two cards and have 64GB. Or three cards for 96GB or? well you get the idea. And if you have a suitable card reader at hand filling those up isn't that slow either. As you can see the expansion slot has some quite vital advantages against built-in memory, so it's no wonder that its popularity is nearing 90% nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A perfect hundred is probably impossible to achieve for a number of reasons, but for all purposes practical the card slot is now considered an inseparable part of the modern cell phone. Again Apple is the only big name that hasn't succumbed to the peer pressure and included a card slot yet. And knowing their ways, they might just never include one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And speaking of card slots we have of course another interesting trend to show you - the microSD card adoption. microSD is the standard on which all major manufacturers non-verbally agreed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even Sony Ericsson switched to microSD cards in their latest handsets and officially ended the war between the tinniest secure digital cards and the Sony proprietary memory stick standard. We all knew the more expensive and less popular M2 cards could never make it for a while now but Sony Ericsson were surprisingly stubborn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first signs of admitting defeat came with the Sony Ericsson K850, the ex-flagship of the company, which sported a slot supporting both standards. Sony Ericsson did release a few more handset with their own memory cards support but once microSD adoption surpassed two-thirds of all card slot-equipped devices (which happened in 2007) there was just no turning back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson K850</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year saw the ultimate domination of the microSD cards in mobile phones with every mobile phone supporting either that standard or having no slot at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So while MMC and its mini-successor RS-MMC cards were the dominant force at some point and M2 having a big share at the times when Sony Ericsson was one of the top two manufacturer it's microSD that triumphs at the end of the day. And with no better standard in sight it's going to stay like this for a while.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We conclude our overview on the features penetration history with the FM radio. The built-in radio receiver is another of those features that has been around for more than a decade now, but has started to rapidly grow in popularity only recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the early days it was a feature almost exclusively available to high-end phones (like the Motorola A6188 and Nokia 8310), which explains the large gap between absolute and weighted average for those years. As FM modules became smaller and cheaper to implement, however, they started to make their way down the ranks and now virtually every handset has them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola A6188 ? Nokia 8310</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For that to be achieved however the antenna is not included in the module and you have to plug some headphones to act as one. Not too bad of a compromise considering that you are most often using them to listen to the radio anyway. There are of course some exceptions, which come with built-in antennas such as the Sony Ericsson R306 and R300 duo, which even sported AM receivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson R300 Radio ? Sony Ericsson R306 Radio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike most of the other features that are considered standard today, the FM radio receiver achieved its status harder. Despite being around since the start of this site, it still hasn't even reached 80% penetration. On the other hand its steady growth suggests that it will do so in another year or two so there's hardly something to worry about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's always good to have an alternative for those moments when the preloaded content on your handset just doesn't do. Some prefer streaming audio over 3G connections instead of FM radio for that - but radio has better coverage and it's free, so the FM radio receivers are here to stay.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This article surely brought up a lot of sweet memories from the good old times. You know, from the days when today's "meh" features were considered a technological breakthrough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's amazing to see how quickly mobile phones evolved really. Even in times of technological revolution, it's hard to think of another business where new features are so quickly adopted and where they go from flagship-exclusives to mid-range necessities so fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we may give you an example, fax machines thirty years ago were slow, loud and rather frustrating to use and nowadays they are?well, basically the same. Even cars with all the big investments that go into them can hardly rival mobile phones in terms of development speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Can you imagine what another ten years of such high-paced evolution will bring? How many features that are today considered eccentric will become a standard in that time? Will pico-projectors make it? And how about gyro-sensors? They might as well do. And, chances are they will bring company too.</paragraph>
