			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sometimes less is more. The Samsung C3300K Champ lets you start small, hoping that sooner or later you will want more. It?s a deal that suits Samsung fine. This here Champ is a touch phone with social networking support, stereo speakers, cordless FM radio and a memory card, camera and Internet. And the sticker price is as low as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, why isn?t everyone running around with a Champ in their pocket? Well first off, the Champ does have all those features but they?re not top of the line ? the camera is a lowly 1.3MP, there?s no 3G and there?s several other glaring omissions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may not be the ideal phone for you but if you?re looking for a phone for your kid, the Samsung C3300K Champ just might be it. The young lad or lass better learn their ABCs before they start pestering you for a new toy. And they can have fast Internet, a beefier camera and Wi-Fi when they buy their own phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Champ still has plenty to get them excited about ? an almost complete touchscreen experience thanks to TouchWiz Lite, social networking, FM Radio that plays without the headphones plugged in. Better yet, it plays on the stereo speakers. There?s a microSD slot as well to hold an extensive music collection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s the pros and cons of getting a Samsung C3300K Champ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s get one thing clear ? the Samsung C3300K Champ is no Galaxy S. But it?s well-built and has all the features, be they not as good as on more expensive phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Champ is cheap ? at around 100 euro you wouldn?t worry much if the phone ends up lost or broken. Like we said ? maybe not the phone for you, but perfect for a kid or young teenager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip to the next page to see what could be the next birthday gift you buy.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Champ<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Champ comes in a smallish box along with a compact charger and a one-piece headset. There?s a manual too, but in a bid to keep the price down, Samsung have left out the data cable. But you probably already have a few of those around and you can always just use a card reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung C3300K Champ 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Samsung C3300K Champ measures 96.3 x 56.8 x 13 mm and at 80 grams it?s one of the smallest touch phones we?ve seen. It?s not as minute as a Sony Ericsson X10 mini, but small enough. It feels tiny and light in our hands, so it should be just right for kids.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Champ is light and made entirely out of plastic, but it?s still solidly built. The rounded corners help slim it down a bit and the overall impression is positive. Keep in mind that this is a phone that costs about as much as some data plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ packs a 2.4? touchscreen, which is big enough for general use. The display has QVGA resolution - which at this size is enough - and it?s suitably bright. The picture quality is ruined by the very limited viewing angles though. The sunlight legibility is pretty poor too ? you?ll need to be in the shade to comfortably use the Champ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is resistive ? this too is at the ?good enough? level. It?s not the most sensitive of touchscreens, but it still registers taps from fingers easily and accurately. A stylus would probably go unused unless you?re really into it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's just the earpiece. It?s actually the first in a duo ? on the opposite side, below the display, is a second er. Yes, the tiny Champ packs stereo speakers and they can sure make some noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also below the display are the three hardware keys. Nothing surprising here, just Call and End keys and the back key in between.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Samsung C3300K Champ, there?s just the lock/hold key, and on the left we find the volume rocker. Those are all the controls the Champ has to offer and they?re all comfortable to use. The lanyard eyelet is in the top left corner and the stylus slots in on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Champ features the 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port, which is protected by a plastic flap. The bottom is left bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the C3300K Champ over, we find the 1.3MP camera lens. It doesn?t have an LED flash, which could have come in handy doubling as a flashlight. The screen will have to do for lighting up dark places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery. You probably wouldn?t expect it from a phone in this price range but there?s a microSD card slot ? you have to remove the back cover to get to it, but it?s hot-swappable. The SIM compartment is under the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quoted standby time is 28 days and we have little reason to doubt that ? there isn?t much on the Samsung Champ to gobble up the battery charge. The stated talk time is 12 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300 Champ is small and lightweight, and the controls will probably be easier to use with kids? rather than adults? hands. Both the volume rocker and the hold key are sitting quite low, so if you?ve got big hands they won?t be easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Champ is good; it shouldn?t fall apart after the first knock. The back cover doesn?t wobble, but we?re not sure if it will survive being opened and closed very often. The phone is glossy and easily picks up fingerprints. If we had to point out any potential weak spots in the build quality, it?s the back cover.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz goes on a diet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz is the go-to UI for Samsung when it comes to touch phones. The screen on the Champ however is too small to comfortably house widgets, so Samsung put it on a diet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz Lite looks just like its sugar-rich sibling ? it?s lively and colorful, it?s pleasantly thumbable and it has widgets. You can switch to another theme ? Choco Cookie ? which brings a cartoony look to the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are a key factor in the touch experience so we?re glad to see that Samsung have kept them in the Lite version of TouchWiz. There?s a one widget per homescreen limit but you get up to 7 homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first homescreen is limited to just an analog or digital homescreen, but the rest offer more variety. There?s a calendar widget, photo contacts widget, profile and memo widgets. There?s a dual clock too, along with a wallpaper switcher and two shortcut widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can only use a widget once, hence the two identical shortcut widgets. Each widget holds up to four shortcuts ? they give instant access to the variety of functions that the Samsung C3300K Champ has to offer - anything from accessing the Internet to the FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you have a new event (e.g. missed call, new email) a tabbed widget (a tab for each kind of event) appears on the homescreen overlaying the widget below. It?s on all homescreens so you need to dismiss it before using the other widgets. The music widget shows up when the music player is active ? it replaces the clock on the 1st homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the homescreen are three fixed shortcuts ? dialer, contacts and menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu displays a 3 x 3 grid of icons and has three pages you can sweep through. The icons themselves are the latest batch that Samsung uses ? on its Bada OS and TouchWiz for Android. The cartoon theme switches those icons and the font, but leaves the homescreen untouched, which isn?t very consistent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ supports Java apps, so you can add games and small apps (among which Opera Mini). It lacks multitasking though, so you can?t have several apps open at once, or even minimize apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the UI has taken a bit of a S60 approach to touch ? in some menus (e.g. the Contacts app) you tap once to select and a second time to activate. In the Messages app however it?s one tap to activate. This is quite inconsistent and it makes interaction with the Champ more complicated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation with the haptic feedback is similar ? some taps have feedback, others don?t depending on what you?re tapping.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook has some rough edges<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ has a pretty good phonebook, but it?s let down by some rough edges. It can store up to 1000 contacts with various fields ? more than enough for its young users. It can show contacts from SIM card, phone or both, change order of names and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign photos to the contacts too, including some cartoony preset images. The whole tap to select, tap again to open thing lets down usability though. Searching is handled poorly too ? you tap Search, enter a few letters (on a 12-key virtual keypad) and press done to get your search results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add contacts to groups or mark up to 20 contacts as Favorites. Additionally, you can have four contacts on the homescreen using the My buddies widget (a simple photo contacts widget).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K is very good at its primary job ? making phone calls. We had no reception problems and the in-call sound quality was good, though a bit too quiet even at the loudest setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the dialer. You dial just like you would on any touch phone. There are several buttons ? contacts, call logs and favorites shortcuts, as well as virtual make call, send SMS and add contact buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s about it - there?s no smart dialing (you should use the phonebook if you need to search for a contact), not even a proximity sensor. During a call, the screen is locked, though you can unlock it with the dedicated Hold key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Buddies widget lets you keep four of you most important contacts on the homescreen. There are no fancy spinning effects this time round and you?re limited to just four contacts, but it?s still quite useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the C3300K Champ scored a good mark. Here it is alongside some of the other devices we have tested. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging depends on T9<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ can handle all common message types. SMS and MMS share and editor and there?s threaded messaging too. Email has a separate inbox and editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing on the Champ relies on a virtual 12-key keypad. There?s no landscape QWERTY but you do get a rich T9 dictionary to help speed things along. However, some regional variants like the C3303K do have an on-screen QWERTY, others (like ours) do not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a native email client. It retrieved the settings for our Gmail account automatically and in seconds it was ready to go. You can set the Champ to retrieve new emails automatically on with some preset period and choose whether to download the whole email or just the headers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking support is too limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were excited to see the Communities app on the Samsung C3300K Champ, but excitement quickly turned to disappointment when we found out it wasn?t the one we?re used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one on the Champ just serves as a list of shortcuts to the social networks rather than provide some native support. One of the key features of the Communities app used to be the file upload ? it could upload multiple files, to multiple services, automatically downsize photos before uploading and schedule the uploads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was a great feature but it?s missing here. There are no SNS widgets either, which offered always-on Twitter connection. The Samsung Corby did a much better job at handling social networks and we were expecting more from the Champ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if you settle for using the browser to access the mobile site of the social networks you could use them, but that?s hardly what we?d call social networking support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good file browser, doubles as a gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C3300K Champ's file browser can display the files and folders from the phone memory or the memory card, and even both at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are preset folders for images, videos and so on, but you can freely create your own folders and use those instead. Initializing microSD cards is quick and you can manage (move, copy, delete) even files that aren?t supported by the Champ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a quick shortcut to send a file over MMS, email or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the file browser is pretty good. It can handle folders, lock files to prevent accidental deletion and order files and folders by name, type, time and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C3300K Champ gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. Browsing the images is fast enough, especially when viewing the small-sized photos from the Champ?s 1.3MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view photos in landscape mode by tapping them (there?s no accelerometer). To zoom in, you?ll have to use the virtual zoom keys or the volume rocker. Zooming and panning are again decently fast, depending on the size of the photo you?re viewing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Samsung C3300K Champ allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a dedicated homescreen widget that can start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen. You can enable a timer to turn off the music player after some period.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, etc. but it also packs three additional options - widening, dynamic and surround effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized to include fast forward and rewind. This adds up to an great music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio plays without headset<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ packs a stereo FM radio that has a built-in antenna. That means it works even without headphones plugged in and with the loud stereo speakers it can easily provide entertainment for a group of people at a moment?s notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio doesn?t have RDS or music recognition service, but we can live without those things. The Champ has the option to record a radio broadcast ? the quickest way to get a new song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature is the program reminders ? you can set several reminders, each for a specific station, active only on certain days. When the time comes, an alarm sounds with a handy button to start the radio and tune it to the preselected frequency. If you have several radio programs you follow, this feature is priceless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen widget works much like the music player widget. You can start/stop the radio and change stations. It too replaces the clock on the first homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is basic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface with not too many features. It can play .3GP and .MP4 videos though we only managed to get QCIF videos playing. Even QVGA proved too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is the option to resume playback from the last position. Other than that, you?ll have to expect compatibility problems with many videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ did reasonably well in our audio quality test. It achieved some excellent scores when you use it as audio source for external amplifiers (such as a car or home stereo), rivaling some of the best handsets we have seen. The stereo crosstalk reading and loudness were the only areas where it failed to impress, although it isn't too bad there either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However once you plug in headphones, the Champ basically loses its stereo capabilities streaming virtually identical sound streams to both channels. You can also see the really high distortion levels in the chart below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very basic snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ features a 1.3 megapixel fixed focus camera for maximum image resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera doesn?t have any fancy features, but it?s nicely touch optimized and very easy to use. It has several effects to offer and also mosaic and frame shooting modes. The first takes several photos and arranges them in a mosaic, while the other is like a cardboard picture with a hole for your face ? it has Santa Claus, a TV and so on. These modes are more fun than useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can adjust brightness, white balance, exposure metering or switch on the Night mode but in the end you?ll probably shoot with everything on auto. You can turn on guidelines to help you arrange the shot and there?s an option to save photos on the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s not much that can be said about the image quality. There?s not enough resolution to capture any fine detail but noise levels are kept down. Colors come off quite dull however. Anyway, the most important thing is that photos are snapped relatively quickly ? it takes a couple of seconds between shots. You are never going to get good quality photos out of a 1.3MP snapper so that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities of the Samsung C3300K Champ are very poor - it maxes out at QCIF@15fps. Hardly any usable videos can be produced with those specs ? they are heavily compressed, the only consolation here being that you can fit more video in an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample Samsung C3300K Champ video recording for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K is usable worldwide with quad-band GSM support and it offers GPRS/EDGE for data connectivity. It sports Bluetooth 2.1, which is useful for swapping files between phones, the Bluetooth Messenger too ? we?ll look at it in a moment. The A2DP support means that you can connect wireless stereo Bluetooth headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Champ has a standard microUSB port and while there?s no data cable in the box, you probably have at least one at home. If not, a microSD card and a card reader are an option too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you do have a cable, you can connect the Samsung C3300K Champ to a computer in Kies or mass storage mode. In mass storage mode, you can?t use any of the phone?s functions while it?s connected but you can still receive calls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser isn?t very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ is equipped with the now aging NetFront 3.5 browser. It manages most mobile web pages, but when you switch to Desktop view mode some of the more complicated pages will cause ?out of memory? errors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, rendering is pretty accurate and scrolling and panning are fast enough (though not quite smooth). Zooming is done with the volume rocker and it?s slow. In full screen, the browser manages to fit a decent amount of text, but again ? you?d be better off using dedicated mobile pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash support is out of the question and you?re stuck with EDGE speeds for opening pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should consider installing Opera Mini. We tried v5.1 and despite a few hiccups, it worked. We had to disable the Mini?s keyboard (new in version 5) and go back to the phone?s native keypad, which worked just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Opera Mini you get better bookmarks through speed dial, tabbed browsing, saving pages and most importantly, Mini?s compression saves on data traffic and speeds up page loading times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K Champ isn?t a champ at Java performance though, so page scrolling is actually a bit slower in the Mini than the NetFront browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3300K has three types of events available in the calendar ? appointment, anniversary and a more generic event. You can set the starting date and time for the event and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung C3300K is very basic. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, a world time application and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is set to 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch also come in useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo applications for jotting down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to forget it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an image editor app ? it?s not Photoshop but has all the basic image manipulation tools (crop, resize, rotate) and has fun effects and clip art. It will do a great job at preparing photos for MMS messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there?s the Bluetooth Messenger ? it works for short range chatting off the (Internet) grid. It works up to a few meters and you can have several chats going at once and even save chats. If the other phone doesn?t have a Bluetooth Messengers, it will receive .VNT files. Not all, but some phones can open those files and read the message even without a BT Messenger. They can answer by sending a note of their own.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Only trial games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of Samsung, the C3300K offers only a bunch of trial games - Asphalt 4, Brain Challenge, DiamondTwister, Pyramid, Crazy Penguin, Monopoly and PyramidBloxx.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the Corby first came out, it was aiming at the young crowd and priced low enough. And it was a success ? spawning countless sequels. The Samsung C3300K Champ aims even lower than the Corby in terms of demographics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed by the screen and its poor viewing angles. There are some software faults too: the old browser, poor SNS support. But as a whole, the Champ is still looking pretty good. It?s simple to use, with plenty of fun features to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s sturdy enough and it won?t break easily. When it does though (or gets lost) ? ah, well, at least it didn?t cost much. This makes it a good phone for the young, who will appreciate all its features and won?t be put off by the ones that don?t work too well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But parents looking at the Champ to buy for their young will inevitably look at the price and compare it against other handsets. Right now, the Champ seems a bit pricy, but the price will fall. And it?s the kind of phone you should be able to get free on a contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there are plenty of phones with similar (or even better) features that came out last year and their prices have settled low enough to compete with the Champ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 Corby boasts a bigger display, better SNS support and fashion jackets. It?s got plenty of appeal for a teen too and while it came out a while ago, it?s a strong contender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie, the phone that started the cheap touchscreen craze, has gotten almost dirt cheap. And with a 3? WQVGA screen, a 3MP camera and a document viewer, it?s one capable phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung?s initial answer to the Cookie, the Samsung S5230 Star, offers a similar feature set to the Cookie at about the same price. Even the LG GD510 Pop, which is a Cookie in a sleeker body, has a very reasonable asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung S3650 Corby ? LG KP500 Cookie ? Samsung S5230 Star </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung 3510 Genoa and S3370 are also worth a mention. Finally, the upcoming LG Cookie T300 is basically identical to the Samsung Champ and we expect it will be priced the same ? these two will definitely find it hard to get along in the sand pit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps Nokia 5250 is an interesting consideration as well, since it's supposed to bring the smartphone price barrier down to 100 euro. We have yet to see about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Samsung C3510 Genoa ? Samsung S3370 ? LG Cookie T300 ? Nokia 5250</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phew. It?s a wall of competitors lining up against the Samsung C3300K Champ. So it all comes down to the price. With the right plan (free unlimited calls to Mom or Dad), this could be a great gift for a pre-teen or a young teenager.</paragraph>
