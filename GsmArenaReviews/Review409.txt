			<paragraph>The RAZR successor the Motorola V3i strives for continuing the legend its predecessor set the beginning of. Motorola has also another highly stylish clamshell, PEBL U6, which has a lot in common with the RAZR models and attracts attention equally well. It's been some time that these phones are out there in the streets and we thought that it would be a shame not to have a review of these two highly acclaimed phones. So we decided to present you both handsets in a joint review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>    Motorola PEBL U6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola PEBL U6 is not any phone; it resembles a true pebble. The handset attracts one's attention not only with its untraditional design, but also with its material, which feels like hard rubber. Motorola PEBL U6 is so stylish that it could hardly remain unnoticed by the people around you. It has dimensions of 87 x 49 x 20 mm and weighs approximately 110 g. Besides the black version we had the opportunity to test, the manufacturer is currently offering other color versions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>    Comparison to a key ? Looks like a pebble in the palm ? First-hand originality<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Totally round<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front cover is decorated with an oblong oval glossy plastic cover, under which one can find the VGA camera lens, the state LED, the manufacturer's logo, and a rather narrow outer display of 32 x 96 pixels. The low resolution of the latter, however, is not a reason to get worried since it is with inverted colors; that means font becomes light if background is dark, tuning-in with the overall concept of the phone. When on stand-by the outer display shows signal strength, battery state, and an analog or digital clock. Of course, it also alerts the user about incoming calls or received messages. Letters are displayed vertically in order to fit into the display screen. To read them easily you need to turn the phone to an angle of 90°. Font can be orientated towards right or left. This option is selected from the main menu. Under worse light conditions the display gets back-lighted in white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; Outer display is only monochrome, but still pretty legible ? VGA camera lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The state LED is located beneath the display. It blinks in green when the phone is being charged and in blue when Bluetooth connection has been established. It has no further functions, which I find rather regretful. For example, it could have been used as an alert of incoming messages or missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   A flat display made of glossy metal welcomes you when you open the phone </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device features a standard swing volume key and the so called "Smart key", which has a user configurable function. This key helps change current ringing profile without having to open the phone. On the right side you will find a single key meant to activate the voice-dialing application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp; Motorola PEBL can hardly be mistaken with any other mobile phone </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do not waste your time in searching the data connector on the bottom of the device. The cable and charger connector together with the eye-let for the hanging stripe are smartly hidden in the top edge of the handset. The connector is a miniUSB one. It works with any common cable, like the one of your digital camera, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp; Data connector is unusually mounted on the top edge of the device </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover protecting the battery is decorated with a white Motorola logo. Here you will also find the loud speaker grill and the release button. The battery is Li-Ion one, with a capacity of 820 mAh. According to the information published on the official site of the manufacturer, it is able to supply the phone with 400 minutes call time or 250 hours of stand-by time. The SIM card is located under the battery and is easily taken out when needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Rear side of the phone is made out of thin cover ? Loudspeaker ? Removing the battery </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simplicity means beauty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola PEBL U6 opens automatically, which is another specific feature in favor of the exceptionality of this device. The opening mechanism is literally expert, even if rather simple. The top half of the phone is kept closed through the use of magnets of reversed polarity located by both the keypad and the display. To open the phone one has to only slide the top half by a few millimeters downwards. This shift makes the magnet next to the display touch another magnet of the same polarity, which then results into a slight uplift of the top half of the phone. The full-opening path is completed due to two strong springs. When opening make sure you hold the handset firmly as the strong push of the springs may make it fly out of your palm. I have to confess that Motorola PEBL U6 got me here. Opening is so flashy and impressive that I kept repeating it during the entire testing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp; The top half gets displaced by a few millimeters in order to be automatically opened ? Magnet detail </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is a true surprise. It is completely flat, except for the four-way navigation key with its confirming central part, which is slightly elevated above the surrounding surface. The keypad is made out of glossy silver metal featuring etched border lines. In general, typing on Motorola PEBL U6's keypad is rather uncomfortable because the border lines are confusing when trying to write fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Magnets attached to the keypad ? Writing is rather uncomfortable </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Located above the numeric part of the keypad are the navigation key and the standard keys for call reception and termination, three soft keys, and the keys for direct access to WAP and the message menu. All keys are big enough. They are all characterized by a low uplift and good press reaction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp; Keypad details ? Navigation key with its central confirming area is slightly elevated above the rest of the keypad surface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keypad is illuminated in cream white. Backlight intensity is however much too weak.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fineness &amp; quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A major part of the top half of Motorola PEBL U6 is occupied by an active TFT display, which glares in 262K colors. The display features a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels on a surface of 30 x 37 mm. It is very fine and the colors are good, both in terms of quality and visualization speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Display is fine and good; yet it could have been a little bit bigger</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To my taste, however, there is too much free space around the display. The manufacturer could have skipped the black frame in order to enlarge the display by a few millimeters in all four directions. Above the display you will only find the speaker grill with the typical "M" character and the standard Motorola logo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key features<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>    Motorola Razr V3i</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR V3i is a direct successor of the widely popular Motorola RAZR, which is after all easily recognizable at the very first sight. Very few details have been changed in terms of design. Apparently, Motorola has stuck to the principle: "If it ain't broken - don't fix it! " RAZR's original look, even if so trite already, remains pretty attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Original RAZR design has only been slightly modified </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Three differences<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Size has remained unchanged (98 x 53 x 14 mm), while weight has been increased by 5 grams to 100 g in comparison to the regular RAZR. The front cover of the phone (from the outside) is made out of a brushed metal plate. A significant part of the front cover is occupied by a black glass protecting the manufacturer's logo and the outer display. Unfortunately, fingerprints remain visible all over it, so one has no other remedy but to wipe it all over again and again. The manufacturer's logo gets illuminated in blue. Not only does it identify the phone, but it also serves as a flashlight. Unfortunately, the logo does not alert of incoming messages or missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RAZR remains a highly stylish slim-design phone even nowadays</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outer display is passive. It features a resolution of 96 x 80 pixels and shows 4K colors. A few moments after the phone has been closed it visualizes the same wallpaper as the one activated on the inside display, including a digital clock, the signal strength indicator, and the battery state indicator. Once the phone is switched to power save mode (after about half a minute of inactivity) the outer display starts to show only the digital clock. Missed events remain invisible. To view them you will need to press a random key or open the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In both upper corners of the cover glass are hidden two LEDs - a green one on the left (activated when the phone is being charged), and a blue one on the right (activated in case of present Bluetooth connection). The camera lens is hidden in the black trapezium in the very top part of the glass. When the phone is closed, its shorter half does not reach its edge, but extends to where the microphone and the loud speaker are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Data connector is located on the thicker side of the phone ? Joint firmness is exemplary </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lateral keys are all located on phone's top half. Located on the left is a couple of volume-control keys and the so called "Smart key", which is used in the menu set up. On the right side is then the voice-dial key. The data connector (miniUSB) is mounted down left, where the bottom half of the phone gets enlarged; it is not protected. The eye-let that allows for hanging the device on a stripe is located on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; All side buttons are located in the upper part of the handset </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear side of the phone mainly constitutes of the battery cover. A little bit lower you will find the loud speaker grill and the external antenna connector protected by a rubber cap. When you remove the cover you will find a Li-Ion battery of 820 mAh, identical to the one used in Motorola PEBL. RAZR V3i is expected to make it through 200 hours of stand-by or 210 minutes of calls in a single charge cycle. The SIM card bed and the microSD slot are situated just next to the battery. A replacement of the SIM card requires removal of the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Memory card goes next to the SIM card ? Battery cover only constitutes a part of the rear cover ? Loudspeaker grill </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Shake the edge out<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new RAZR V3i is opened in a standard way, that is, manually. Its top half reaches full-open position due to the support of a strong spring. Keypad is virtually identical to the one of the original RAZR model. Keys are flat, etched into silver lamina.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; The phone is only 14 mm thick </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four-way navigation key does not stand out above the surrounding surface either. All keys feature low uplift and good press reaction. Typing on RAZR V3i is more practical and generally easier than on Motorola PEBL as RAZR V3i's keys are distributed in a standard way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Hardly any differences against the forerunner can be found inside the new RAZR V3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the standard numeric keys you will see (like in the Motorola PEBL) the navigation key with its confirming central part, the standard keys for call reception and termination, a pair of keys for direct access to the message menu and WAP, and three context keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Keypad is totally flat, with the backlighting being controlled by a light-sensitive sensor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark border lines get illuminated in dark blue. Number keys are illuminated in a slightly lighter nuance of the same color. Keypad backlighting is controlled by a light sensor, that is, it is switched-off anytime the light conditions permit it, saving this way a lot of energy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad backlighting </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: bigger, but also poorer in colors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main display of the new RAZR V3i is active. It shows 262Kcolor on a surface of 176 x 220. It looks very fine regardless of being bigger than the display of Motorola PEBL: 35 x 44 mm. It is color visualization where RAZR V3i scores a little bit worse. To my opinion, colors on PEBL's display look deeper and generally better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Main display </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two frames around the display: a black and a silver one saying Motorola. Above the frames is situated the speaker grill halved by the manufacturer's logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  New illuminated logo ? Indicator of Bluetooth activity</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rest of the review is going to cover both models as their interfaces are virtually identical. As to photos, some of them have been taken with Motorola RAZR V3, a few then with Motorola V3i. The main menu and interface do not differ, except for very few details.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interface: the same song all over again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Interface in both models is identical to the one applied in the original RAZR and other Motorola models. As usual, in the top area of the stand-by display one can find a standard bar with state icons, operator's name, and date. This group of details can be either aligned left, or centered. A bit lower there are four icons symbolizing the functions assigned to each way of the navigation key. The bottom right corner is reserved for the digital or analog clock. In the very bottom of the display there is a bar with all functions than one can activate by using the context soft keys. When not active, the display may show a screen saver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Motorola V3i's main display and menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Main display and menu of Motorola V3i or PEBL, or RAZR - it is all identical</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main menu is accessed by a press on the central area of the navigation key or the middle context key. The main menu can be displayed in the form of a nine-icon matrix, or as a text list with tiny icons at the margin of each item. In any case, menu items, including those in the message menu, can be reordered. A major part of all menu items, except for multimedia ones, constitute of text only, sometimes accompanied by an icon. Menu design can easily be modified using pre-installed themes. Motorola PEBL offers a total of four themes, while RAZR V3i has five of them. Both phones respond to menu orders somewhat slower than expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may sometimes get confused as to what this or that menu option means; do not panic though as such situations are rather common in work with phones manufactured in USA. Motorola has been applying the same interface all over again for years now. Yet, it does not show even a minor intention to modernize it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola PEBL has 5.8 MB of internal memory and expansion through memory card is impossible. RAZR scores far better with internal memory of almost 12 MB. What's more, it has a micro SD memory card slot, which limits the risk of running out of memory nearly to zero.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls: further errors to comment on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, both new Motorola models show controls errors worth commenting, just like it happened with the interface. Each of the ways of the navigation key, both context keys and the Smart key can be assigned one of all 50 pre-defined functions available in the phone. If you manage to distribute well these functions you may not even need to access the menu. The keys for direct access to the menu and the WAP browser are handy, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Menu as a list of items o menu in matrix ? changing item order </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone software does not permit the use of the central area of the navigation key for confirmation of certain items in the menu, which I find rather illogical. For example, when names are inserted into the phonebook or tasks are typed into the calendar, a press on the navigation key center opens the sample names menu. In this aspect, I expect Motorola menu to take beginners more time to get used to than other brands' menus would.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cameras: the megapixel is useless without a memory card<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both models have a built-in camera. Motorola PEBL U6's one only has a VGA sensor, while Motorola RAZR V3i features 1.23 MP. Both phones capture sound video in 3GP format in a maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. Video records are limited to approximately 490 KB, which is the equivalent of about ? -minute duration. RAZR V3i's camera scores better, with a maximum resolution of 1280 x 960. If held in a standard way, that is, as a normal mobile phone, Motorola RAZR V3i displays pictures vertically. Make sure, however, you have inserted a memory card into the device, otherwise you can only take photos in VGA resolution and lower. In RAZR V3i you will also find a few photo effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos taken with Motorola RAZR V3i:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Camera creates strange vertical photos </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;    </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras offer a night mode, a white balance option, a digital zoom (RAZR - 8x, PEBL - 4x), which only really crops the picture, and deactivation of the shutter sound. Photos taken can be sent via Bluetooth to another mobile phone or to PC. Yet, overall picture quality provided by both phones is rather poor.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calls: almost perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Regarding call functions, Motorola models have proved to be reliable devices. New models are no exception to this rule. Phonebook fits in up to 1000 contacts, each of which can be assigned a huge amount of fields: a nickname, 6 phone numbers, an email address, a street, a city and its code, a region, a state, a picture, a ringtone, and a birthdate, which appears directly in the calendar. Another error, which has been present in Motorola phones for a long time now, appears once again in both new phones: if you assign a particular ringtone to a certain number, this is heard both when the corresponding person is calling and when they send you a message, so you have no chance to recognize which of these two actions actually happens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phonebook shows contacts from the phone memory and the SIM card simultaneously. Searching is performed by gradual typing of the contact's name. Contacts can be included in a user created group. Groups however cannot be used as call filters. The phone offers a total of 6 ringing profiles, whose setup options are rather extensive. Vibration types are different for the various ringing profiles, but are not user configurable. Nevertheless, both Motorola PEBL U6 and Mororola RAZR V3i ring and vibrate simultaneously. As it was mentioned above, profiles can be switched from one to another even when phone body is closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Phonebook in the form of a text list ? Phonebook with icons of images ? Contact detail </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any MP3 file or polyphonic melody can be used as a ringtone. Sound is loud enough. There is also a speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Editing a name in the phonebook </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones are quad-band and both work in GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: poor iTap and unpractical keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Message menu is accessed through a press on the envelope button. In it you will find SMS, MMS, and emails. The display offers 8 lines for both typing and reading. The phone memory can receive and save up to 150 SMS, alerted by a melody of user's choice. As usual, typing is supported by the iTap dictionary. Once you have started to type a message, do not close the phone or you will lose what's been written. Both models feature EMS support and thus allow for a melody or a tiny picture to be attached to SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Message menu ? Composing options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When SMS is being created, both PEBL U6 and RAZR V3i start to count from 450 available characters. User is informed about the total number of split messages only after the number of the recipient is inserted. Messages can be sent in bulk. Delivery notification is not received automatically, but has to be activated every time before a message is sent. Old messages can be automatically deleted in user configurable intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Typing a SMS </paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS share an editor with SMS. They may contain a picture, a voice record, a sound, a video, and details about the corresponding contact copied from the phonebook. A preview is available, too. The maximum MMS size is 100 KB. Received MMS are saved into a folder common for both MMS and SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both new Motorola models offer an email client, which works with attachments as well as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 protocols. It manages more than one account at once, and can check for new mail either automatically in preconfigured intervals, or manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither of the phones offers comfortable typing, so I do not recommend them to users who type messages frequently. The iTap dictionary has a rather poor dictionary, so its worth is up to the user who should teach it plenty of new words. Both models respond fast. PEBL's keypad is quite attractive, but also rather unpractical, while keys on RAZR are distributed more successfully.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer: no task or note organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar application in both devices offers a month, a week, and a day view. Events can only be of one particular type, but they can include a legend, start time, duration details etc. They can be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, or once a year. Alert time is user configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Month, week and day view at the calendar </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm clocks, which also serve like a "reminder". Any melody can be used as an alarm. The alarm would go off even when the devices are off. Alarm is not repeatable though. The built-in voice recorder saves records of maximum 1-minute, which I consider to be rather low capacity with respect to the overall memory available in both phones. Among java applications in PEBL you will also the so called password memory available that is only available in English. Both models feature a simple intuitive calculator, which does not give priority to mathematical operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calculator </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither of the phones features a task or note organizer, which once again comes to prove that Motorola remains far behind in comparison to current top mobile handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fun: MP3 and Java<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the java application available in Motorola RAZR V3i is its MP3 player. It sorts MP3 files by album and artist name and allows for creating one's own playlists, but cannot be minimized. Music can be minimized and still listened to by the use of a simple file manager, which however requires that you switch songs by yourself. Loudspeaker quality is good in both phones. I could not test earphones quality though as I did not found any in either of the original packages. In any case, earphones are to be plugged into the miniUSB connector or wirelessly through Bluetooth (Motorola RAZR V3i). Considering the fact that Motorola PEBL's memory is not expandable and that its 5 MB do not meet even the minimum requirements for music listening, the phone can hardly ever be used as a MP3 player. What a pity that Motorola has failed to implement a FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Music player can be minimized </paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Java music player is able to order items, but cannot be minimized </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Java 2.0 is available in both models. In Motorola PEBL U6 you will find 3 applications already put by the manufacturer: a password storing application, a fitness program for tracking calories, weight etc, and a fighter plane shooting game. This game is also available, together with a card game, in Motorola RAZR V3i. According to jBenchmark results, Java is relatively slow in both devices, which results into cuts in animation flow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data with GPRS only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Should you want to transfer data, you will have to make do with GPRS Class 10 as neither Motorola PEBL U6, nor Motorola RAZR V3i has EDGE. GPRS is useful for WAP browsing (version 2.0) or for connecting a PC to Internet. Both phones can be easily connected to a PC via Bluetooth or through a data USB cable. Neither of the phones has an Infrared port. Synchronization and data transfers between PC and each of the phones require the installation of the new version of the software Motorola Mobile Phone Tools, which has to be bought additionally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  WAP browser </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Does the design make up for the rest?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both Motorola PEBL U6 and Motorola RAZR V3i are highly stylish devices of attractive design and top-quality construction. Owning one of these phones guarantees you an ever-present attention on behalf of people around. Yet, in order to achieve originality Motorola has sacrificed a number of important functions, offering at the same time rather low levels of user-friendliness in interface in general. It seems as if Motorola failed to catch up with technological innovations as it still uses interfaces from models like V300, V500, and V600, which are three-year old now. In the mean time other manufacturers have made a huge progress in making their interface more user-friendly, leaving Motorola far behind.</paragraph>
