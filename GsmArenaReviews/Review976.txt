			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back when phones were just phones, a couple of buttons and an earpiece were enough. Now we try to pump our entire lives through our smartphones and a big screen is a must. With the new 6+ inch phablets happy to oblige, pocket size is bigger than ever before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two in particular - the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and the Huawei Ascend Mate - caught our eye as potential competitors, so we thought we'd let them take a few swings at each other and see which one is still standing at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that both of these are clearly midrange devices. They won't challenge the 5" 1080p flagships or premium phablets. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 and Ascend Mate go by the "big screen, passable specs" formula.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a blow-by-blow report of how each phone is better than its competitor:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend Mate over Galaxy Mega 6.3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Big items like LTE and battery capacity stand out, but there are other differences that might make or break a phablet. Depending on your habits, NFC or an FM radio might swing from irrelevant to must-have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phablets went from niche to mainstream in no time, but even so, a 6+ inch screen clearly isn't everyone's cup of tea. Still, both the Ascend Mate and Galaxy Mega 6.3 are reasonably pocketable while being perfectly able to stand in for a 7" tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we've done plenty of these head-to-head articles before so the plan is clear - check the hardware (with a focus on the screen and the battery), review the software (paying attention to benchmark performance) and round it all off with the camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and Huawei Ascend Mate are 6+ inch phablets. While both are undeniably big, the Mega 6.3 is bigger - as its name suggests it packs a 6.3" screen versus the 6.1" screen of the Mate. We'll discuss the screens in more detail in the next chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Note boasts a 73% screen to surface ratio, but Samsung is even a tad more efficient than that - the Mate is only 4mm shorter than the Mega 6.3 and both have virtually the same width. Not bad considering you gain 0.2" of diagonal, which is 6% more screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What actually makes a difference is that Samsung used its traditional hardware keys below the screen, while Huawei opted for on-screen buttons, which reduces the usable screen area. To counter that, the company added a feature that lets you hide the on-screen buttons, but that doesn't work very well (not if you want to use more than one app or the back button).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, both weigh about the same - a smidge under 200g - but the Galaxy Mega 6.3 is 1.9mm thinner. While that looks good, the Mega packs a smaller battery (3,200mAh vs. 4,050mAh). On the up side, the battery is user-replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with a user-replaceable battery, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 hides the microSIM and microSD card slots under the back cover. The Ascend Mate gives easier access to both - the slots are side-mounted and hidden under individual plastic flaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's talk design. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 uses the Galaxy family styling, of which many people are getting tired (used on devices with screens ranging from 3" to 8", it's a little played out). The glossy plastic puts off many people as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that the Huawei Ascend Mate is a particularly attractive piece of slab, but at least it's not overplayed like the Mega design and has a more sensible matte finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, we like how thin the Galaxy Mega 6.3 is and while the curved back of the Mate hides some of its thickness, those extra 1.9mm are noticeable. On the up side, that curve makes the phablet sit a little better in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty similar - Power/Lock key and volume rocker on the right, 3.5mm audio jack on top, microUSB port on the bottom, along with a mic. The microUSB port on the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 gives it an advantage with MHL support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Bigger screen and thinner body tip the scales towards the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3, though the lack of Gorilla glass and the worn out design don't do it any favors. It's good that the battery is user replaceable, but the smaller capacity might come back to bite it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate is an okay device that takes the battery and screen protection rounds, but it's not enough to win this fight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 6+ inch diagonal, we're talking big screens. While the 720p resolution isn't up to some people's standards, it's quite enough for the mid-range devices that the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and Huawei Ascend Mate clearly are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel density is 241ppi for the Mate and 233ppi for the Mega 6.3 (which has 0.2" bigger screen). Graphics, even small type, are fairly smooth especially when you consider that you hold the bigger screen further away from your eyes. Sure, it's not as sharp as the latest 1080p screens, but those are impossible to get at this price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and Huawei Ascend Mate screens under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should mention that despite the bigger physical size of the displays, the interface isn't "bigger" than what you'd get on a 4.5" 720p screen - you still get five shortcuts per row of the screen and many apps will render the same on 720p screens despite the difference in screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both screens have pleasing colors, but the Huawei Ascend Mate offers a slider to adjust the color temperature of the screen (you can go from warm to cold, depending on your preference). The Samsung Galaxy S4 has screen color adjustments too, but Samsung decided not to share this particular feature with the Mega 6.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of viewing angles, the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 is very good with only the slightest contrast shift. The Huawei Ascend Mate's screen showed a more noticeable distortion at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has put a bright screen on the Ascend Mate, it's been a while since we saw a big screen break the 700nit barrier. The black levels aren't great, but they are still better than what the Sony Xperia Z had to offer and the Mate's screen has noticeably better contrast (because of its high brightness).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 screen isn't particularly bright, in fact it barely beats the Super AMOLED screen of the Galaxy S4. The Mega 6.3 has very good contrast though, a hair more than the iPhone 5 and close the LG Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen glass on the Huawei Ascend Mate is very reflective though, so even with its much higher brightness it couldn't top the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 in terms of sunlight legibility. Both score towards the bottom of the pack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The screens on both phablets are extra sensitive and can be used even with gloves on. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 goes a step further and can detect your finger hovering above the screen, which triggers some S Pen-like actions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascent Mate earns back some points for packing Gorilla Glass protection, there's no mention of scratch-resistance for the Mega 6.3 screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Better scratch protection and higher brightness is how the Huawei Ascend Mate won this round. The viewing angles and the black levels could have been better, but overall it's a good screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 has a slightly bigger screen, but not by much. It can take comfort in having the better contrast, viewing angles and sunlight legibility, but not by a big enough margin for a win here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Big devices, big batteries. Or in the case of the Huawei Ascend Mate, bigger battery. A whopping 4,050mAh against "just" 3,200mAh of the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3. Both have big screens, which will draw a lot of power (we're guessing the 0.2" difference won't matter much), but very different chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 400 that powers the Galaxy Mega 6.3 has proven to be very power-efficient, while the HiSilicon K3V2 inside the Ascend Mate has yet to make a name for itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test, 3G talk time, shows a massive advantage for the Ascend Mate - it's our new champion, finally dethroning the Motorola RAZR MAXX. Intel deserves some of the credit here too for supplying the modem the Mate uses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 doesn't do too bad either with 20 hours of talk time. In fact, if we adjust for the difference in battery capacity, the two phablets score exactly the same. That's the price of vanity (and thin profile), we guess.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser test was a surprise - both the Mega 6.3 and Mate died within a minute of each other. With a time of 8 hours and 17 minutes, they place in the Top 10. The Ascend Mate has 25% more battery capacity and a slightly smaller screen. The screen is brighter though and the Cortex-A9s are usually less power-efficient than Krait (especially when it's 4 against 2), which explains the even result despite different batteries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playback test was no contest - the Huawei Ascend Mate posted a nearly 50% better result than the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3. The brighter screen didn't hurt the Mate too much, so it's either a more efficient video decoder or the Cortex-A9s really suck the power out of the battery when rendering web pages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The endurance rating is a convincing win for the Huawei Ascend Mate with an impressive 81 hour result. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 scored an okay 60 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: With definitive wins in the talk time and video playback tests, a good web browsing result and a great endurance rating, the Huawei Ascend Mate takes the battery crown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 showed good results, but the relatively small (for a phablet) battery capacity put a limit on how far it can go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Software and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and Huawei Ascend Mate both run Android Jelly Bean, but the Mega has the newer 4.2 version over 4.1 for the Mate. Both are heavily skinned, adding many useful features and a few gimmicks to stock Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the most useful proprietary feature on the Galaxy Mega is Multi-window - it splits the screen in half so that you can use two apps at a time. This is one of those things that makes a big screen worthwhile. 6.3" is big enough to comfortably fit two apps, where both will get about the same surface area as on a 4.5" 16:9 screen, though with a different aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice perk of the Mega 6.3 is the widget-enabled lockscreen. That's an Android 4.2 feature, which Samsung fiddled with a bit. Anyway, it gives at a glance info and the DashClock widget has gotten quite popular. It's a shame to leave only a handful of shortcuts on a 6+ inch lockscreen though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where both custom UIs fail is to leave the beautifully simple Android interface untouched. The latest of TouchWiz has toned down the Eclair-era looks, but it still catches a lot of flak. To be fair, the Huawei Emotion UI won't win many fans over either, despite the ton of preloaded themes that also come with their own icon packs, lockscreen look and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz may not be very pretty, but it's the most functional and tweakable UI around, the multitude of options in the Settings menu is a little daunting. The quick toggles in the notification area are one example - you can rearrange them, view them all at once and there's a brightness slider (which can be hidden). Emotion UI on the Ascend Mate has toggles too, which can similarly be viewed all at once and rearranged (no brightness slider though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another win for TouchWiz is that the homescreen can rotate to landscape orientation - a 6+ inch device will often be used horizontally and jumping from a landscape app to a portrait homescreen can be annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it doesn't end here - Emotion UI features a one-level interface like iOS or MIUI. That means there's no app drawer, all apps shortcuts and widgets share the homescreen panes. This can get in the way of arranging widgets just the way you want them as new installs will just shove more and more app shortcuts on the homescreen, even apps you rarely use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Samsung and Huawei have decided to include one-handed mode for parts of the UI (the keyboards and keypads), which is great as stretching your thumb might not quite reach the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has gone a step further and added Easy Panel, which is a floating widget (similar to Facebook's chat heads) that pulls up four shortcuts that launch small apps. This widget can be maneuvered into a comfortable position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, a custom launcher can eradicate many of the limitations of the default homescreens, so there's a way out if you really don't like what the companies have done to Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung added only the Smart Stay feature of its Smart Screen suite to the Galaxy Mega 6.3. It's one of the more useful ones - it uses the front-facing camera to periodically check if you're still looking at the device (e.g. reading a long passage) so it doesn't lock or dim the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Air View, which allows you to hover your finger over things to get more info or a preview - e.g. the text of an SMS in the Messaging app, the description of an event in S Planner, what's ahead in the timeline of a video, photos inside a folder in the gallery and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the Huawei Ascend Mate scores a win is the Office department - it comes with a full blown editor, Kingsoft Office, while the Galaxy Mega 6.3 only gets the Polaris Office Viewer for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music players on both phablets are quite capable and even support FLAC out of the box, good news for audiophiles. Huawei went with Dolby Mobile sound enhancements, while Samsung stuck to its own SoundAlive tech. We'll check the audio quality of both the Mega 6.3 and the Mate later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video players are pretty good too, though the Huawei pulls ahead with better codec support (DivX, DTS and AC3 all worked, while the Mega 6.3 choked on them). The Mega 6.3 does have Pop Up Play that plays the video in a small floating window as you use other apps, but honestly we'd rather see Multi-window support for the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 has a leg up on the Huawei Ascend Mate when it comes to connectivity. We mentioned the MHL support in the hardware chapter, but there's more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, the Mega 6.3 has a version with LTE connectivity while the Mate is 3G only. However, the Mate has 42Mbps HSDPA while the Mega 6.3 has the slower 21Mbps HSDPA, but the LTE version offers 100Mbps downlink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 also packs NFC connectivity, which is slowly gaining popularity with Android and Windows Phone users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the IR blaster on top, which allows the Samsung phablet to control home equipment like TVs, disc players, air conditioners and such.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group Play might be a gimmick, but it might be fun to try as long as you find a friend with a compatible Galaxy device (there should be plenty of Galaxy S4s around). The same goes for S Beam vs. AirSharing (both have Wi-Fi Direct though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also includes S Voice on its Galaxy devices, which is an alternative to Google Voice Search with better functionality when it comes to controlling the phone but we prefer Google's solutions (Voice Search and Now) overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: One-level UIs just don't work very well on Android. Also, the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 runs a newer version of Android at the moment and scores big points for Multi-window and better connectivity. Smaller things like a widget-enabled lockscreen and landscape homescreen also weigh in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate hits back with an Office editor and a better video player, but the theming capabilities of the Emotion UI are not enough to fix what ails it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker test was fairly straightforward. Both phablets have a single loudspeaker on the back, nothing fancy, and both scored a Good mark. Given their size, we were hoping for something louder, but you shouldn't have problems hearing the phablets ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: It's a tie. While the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 posted marginally higher numbers in the individual challenges, it's something we can tell only using specialized equipment, not our ears.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 comes with a Snapdragon 400 chipset, which is not up to par with the current flagships but performed very well against last year's flagships. It packs two Krait 200 CPU cores clocked at 1.7GHz and Adreno 305 GPU, plus 1.5GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate relies on a homebrewed chipset, the K3V2, which uses four Cortex-A9 cores at 1.5GHz and a 16-core GPU of unknown design. It has more RAM, 2GB of it. Basically, it's very similar to a Tegra 3 or Exynos 4 Quad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-core performance on the Krait core is better before even accounting for the clockspeed advantage, so it's no surprise the Galaxy Mega 6.3 easily takes this round. But Android has reached a point where it can successfully leverage multiple cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the 2:1 core count advantage of the Ascend Mate, it can't score a multithreading victory. In fact, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 pulls well ahead in Linpack and has a slim lead in Geekbench 2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on to full system tests, AnTuTu and Quadrant, the Huawei Ascend Mate and Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 trade victories. Both are towards the bottom of the pack, but even the year-old flagship Galaxy S III has slid down in the rankings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not quite sure what the GPU inside the K3V2 chipset of the Ascend Mate is, but it didn't do too hot in GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt and it failed to run 2.7 T-Rex properly (both in 1080p off-screen mode). The Mega 6.3 isn't far ahead in the Egypt benchmark, but it's on par with the Galaxy Note II and it did run the T-Rex bench.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While neither GPU offered playable framerate at 1080p, they were designed for 720p screens, like the ones on the Galaxy Mega 6.3 and the Ascend Mate. Here the difference in performance is almost double in favor of the Mega 6.3, which was very close to the 60fps software limit. The Huawei Ascend Mate, however, offered a 33.2fps average, meaning it dropped below the 30fps mark on several occasions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to web performance. With an advantage in single-threaded performance, the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 easily takes the win in SunSpider. Throw in some HTML5 stuff to render and the distance to the Huawei Ascend Mate gets smaller, but it's still ahead.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>&#x410;udio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two phablets are quite evenly matched in the first part of our audio quality test - when attached to an active external amplifier. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 holds a tiny advantage with its cleaner output and is also a bit louder even if both devices are average at best in that regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged in a pair of headphones, the gap between the two increased as the Huawei Ascend Mate allowed some intermodulation distortion to creep in, whereas the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 remained almost perfectly clean.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Every maker has its own version of what a camera interface should look like - Huawei went with a fairly standard UI, while Samsung is continuing with the Galaxy Camera UI design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei camera interface is certainly familiar - a virtual shutter key on the right, flanked by a still/video toggle and the gallery shortcut, then three vital shortcuts on top (front/back camera toggle, flash mode and touch focus toggle). The rest are hidden in a retractable panel on the left, which uses sub-menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung combines the still and video camera UI, which simplifies things as you can just start shooting in either mode without having to toggle first. The downside is that if you're doing 4:3 photos (which you should if you want to get the max resolution of 8MP), you get black bars where the left and right portions of the 16:9 video are, which makes framing more difficult.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Samsung has made the various options more accessible - to choose a different shooting mode or color effect on the Galaxy Mega 6.3 you only need two taps instead of three on the Ascend Mate. The customizable row of shortcuts can make some features accessible with a single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aspect ratio mismatch between stills and video aside, the Galaxy Mega 6.3's interface feels more modern and makes shooting and changing settings quicker. Now let's have a look at what those two have to offer in terms of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 sorts its camera options into three groups. The most interesting one is accessed through the Mode button and offers burst shot, night mode, HDR, panorama, best photo and best face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exclusive features are Drama shot (creates multiple copies of a moving object), Eraser (removes a moving object) and Sound &amp; shot (captures ambient sound along with the photo, but such shots can't be shared with other devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the color effects tucked away in a retractable panel at the bottom of the screen. The third one is the Settings menu in the upper left, which controls image properties (ISO, exposure, white balance), shooting assistants (grid, metering, anti-shake) and an option to turn the volume rocker into a zoom lever, still or video shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate on the other hand piles it all in the panel to the left, which offers four options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First is shooting mode (burst, night mode, HDR, panorama, group shot). Then there are color effects, third are face effects (adds distortions to faces in the shot, like a digital house of mirrors) and finally the settings menu, which offers scenes, ISO, white balance, grid and a few other options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching to video mode changes the available options. The available four are video resolution, white balance, face effects and settings (with an anti-shake option).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we looked at the different fields of view for the two cameras that is how much you can fit in a single shot. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 camera is wider, meaning you can fit more of the scene standing at a fixed distance compared to the Huawei Ascend Mate, but the downside is there's fewer pixels for each object (as both cameras are 8MP shooters).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation with the FoV for video is virtually the same, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 has a slightly wider camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 had an advantage both in terms of UI and feature set. It also has a slightly wider FoV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that the Huawei Ascend Mate is lagging far behind, but it doesn't really bring anything over the company's previous generation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and the Huawei Ascend Mate both feature 8MP cameras, but that doesn't mean they offer the same image quality. We took sample photos with both and prepared 100% crops, but you can also view the full resolution photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with color, it's one of the first things you notice. Neither phablet is on the mark - the Galaxy Mega 6.3 has slightly oversaturated colors and a green tint over the whole image (it's very noticeable in the sky), while the Ascend Mate offered dull colors in the green channel (check out the tree in the middle).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mega 6.3 camera managed to capture more fine detail than the Mate and its images are generally sharper. It's visible in the fire escape stairs, the foliage, the text and the clockwork mechanism in the ad poster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mega 6.3 tends to underexpose shadows to preserve detail in the highlights, while the Ascend Mate prefers the opposite and overexposes highlights to develop the shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some full resolution photos for a closer look at the image quality of both phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out the HDR modes of both phablets to see how they handle scenes with dark shadows and bright highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras focused on the shadows, leaving the highlights mostly intact. The Huawei Ascend Mate HDR mode really exaggerates the effect, which many people do not appreciate, and the boosted brightness in the shadows didn't really bring new detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 was more subtle and actually managed to get some usable detail out of the shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the camera samples we used for the above crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried out the panorama modes. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 does sweep panorama (meaning you just pan left or right), while the Huawei Ascend Mate takes three separate photos. The total resolution is about the same with an advantage for the Mate, which produced a taller image (1200 pixels vs. 1800 pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 did a full 360 circle and was fairly fast, considering it had to shoot a wider arc. The Mate took a couple of seconds after each of the three shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both have stitching problems, especially when there are fast moving objects involved, but the Mega 6.3 did a better job. The Ascend Mate blurs parts of the image to blend the separate shots, which results in blotches of low detail, especially around the seams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should also take a peek at our Photo compare tool. It features an ISO chart to measure the synthetic resolution, along with a couple of other charts with colors, high-frequency detail and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 vs. Huawei Ascend Mate</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: While neither camera is in the top flight of 8MP shooters, the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 produced sharper images. Its did a better job of the HDR and panos than the Mate as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate could use a tweak in how it processes images and the HDR and panorama modes need work too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>1080p video at 30fps is the target of both phablets and they hit it nicely. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 records videos at a bitrate of about 17Mpbs, of which 128Kbps are dedicated to stereo audio (48KHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate goes higher with the total bitrate - almost 25Mbps - but it uses more basic encoding and lower audio bitrate - 96Kbps for stereo audio (48KHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phablets encode their videos with the AVC codec (a.k.a. h.264), but the Mega 6.3 uses High@L4.0 with CABAC versus the Baseline@L5.0 encoding of the Mate. So, the Mega 6.3 video encoder is more efficient and uses less storage without affecting the quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, it manages to produce better image quality as the crop below demonstrates. The image is sharper, which is easily seen in the foliage. A closer look, however, reveals that the Mega 6.3 video "pulses" - the fine detail gets smudged periodically and then returns - so it's not all great with its video encoder. The Ascend Made has a hint of the same problem, but the higher bitrate keeps the effect to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras maintain their respective color tints from the still photos - green for the Mega and pink-purple for the Mate. The videos are smooth and the continuous autofocus isn't too intrusive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the video samples we shot with both phablets:</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Our Video compare tool backs up our findings so far. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 captures more detail overall. Also, in poor lighting conditions, the Ascend Mate video is grainier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 vs. Huawei Ascend Mate</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 offers better video quality while using less storage and captures slightly better audio. It's not perfect though, we wish Samsung would fix the "pulsing" effect and the color tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate shoots okay 1080p video, but it's just not up to par.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you go back to count the individual wins, you'll find that the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 won most of the challenges. But it's no secret that you can get a better device for more money and, unfortunately for the Mega 6.3, it costs more than the Galaxy Note II at the time of writing and considerably more than its opponent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Huawei Ascend Mate &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 I9200</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate makes no claims to be the best device in the world, but the difference in pricing levels things out. Having looked at the prices at a few UK and German retailers, the Ascend Mate can be had at &#x20ac;380 / ?340, while the Galaxy Mega 6.3 will set you back &#x20ac;490 / ?470. Also, the Mate is available right now while the Mega 6.3 is still "coming soon" at some stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong - we quite like the Galaxy Mega 6.3, it was quite good in all of the tests we ran and for people who do lots of web and email, it's great to have that big 6.3" screen. But at this price we'd probably look to buy a Galaxy Note II or go for a Galaxy Tab 8.0 and have a real tablet (it's going to launch soon at &#x20ac;300) and buy a phone with the leftover money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upcoming Asus Fonepad Note FHD6 will up the ante soon with a 6" 1080p screen, a stylus and stereo speakers, which might convince us to part with more of our hard-earned cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 &#x2022; Asus Fonepad Note FHD6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate isn't perfect either, but the huge battery sure is appealing (Gorilla glass and a brighter screen sound good too). Everything else was good enough as well, again we're talking midrange here and the price is a key factor. Sure, the Mega 6.3 price will fall eventually, but so will the Mate's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now the Huawei Ascend Mate delivers a better bang for the buck. Finding it hard to match Huawei's price, Samsung responds with better equipment for the Galaxy Mega 6.3. A classic case of using aggressive pricing to compete against a stronger brand, these two phablets allow a very reasonable choice between budget and comfort.</paragraph>
