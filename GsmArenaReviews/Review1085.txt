			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wait, did hell just freeze over? Maybe a couple of degrees cooler? Rumors of a mini version of the iPad had been laughed at, dodged and denied - not necessarily in that order and often all at once. But here it is - the iPad mini is finally a reality. It caused due measures of excitement and perhaps a bit of disappointment. Yet, in typical Apple fashion, it's an excellent piece of hardware. In short, it's a polarizing device that may as well be the next best-selling tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have to hand it to Apple's R&amp;D team - they know how to design hardware. The iPad mini is super thin and light, with a cool aluminum shell. Sure, they swore they'd never make a 7" tablet and the truth is they still haven't - the 7.9" screen of the mini offers 36% more real estate than the screens of the Google Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Less bezel on the left and right of the screen combined with the ~310g of weight make it reasonably comfortable to hold with one hand. Apple did make some compromises, which drew a lot of ire. Here's the summarized list of what's good and what's bad about the Apple iPad mini:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The disadvantage list may seem longer than usual but most of the items there are general complaints that apply to virtually all Apple products, like the absence of a memory card slot. The way we see it, there are three main problems with the iPad mini - the (relatively) low-res screen, the old chipset and the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple products have so far effortlessly hit it big with users despite their perceived limitations compared to the competition. The new crop of iPads - the iPad 4 and iPad mini - already sold in the millions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software - iOS 6 - should be very familiar to Apple users, but the hardware is new. It's not like the big iPads, which mostly varied in thickness, this one has been designed to comfortably hold in one hand and slip into a coat pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some analysts have gone as far as to say that the iPad mini will become the iPad - it's highly portable, capable enough and drawing on the vast resources of the Apple eco-system. And if you adjust for the "Apple tax", the mini isn't that expensive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Apple iPad mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini comes in a box that's proportionately smaller than the iPad 4's package. Besides the tablet itself, there's only a Lightning cable and a small charger. It's the iPhone type of charger, not the one the big iPad gets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini faithfully follows the design language of the previous iPads and the iPhone. There are subtle differences but if you've used an Apple product, you should feel right at home with the mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the new iPhone, which uses two distinct kinds of finish on the back, the iPad mini's rear is all aluminum - and the sides too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7.9" screen bezel is thinner on the sides than top and bottom, unlike the big iPads and similar to the iPhone. Just like the iPhone, the iPad mini's software detects and ignores false touches from the sides of the screen, so resting your thumbs shouldn't be a problem - the mini is meant to be held with your palm on its back anyway, not by the side bezel like you would its bigger sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, above the screen is the 1.2MP FaceTime camera, which is right in the middle. Below the screen (also in the middle) is the familiar home button. Except it's the tiniest home button so far, smaller than that of the big iPad and the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's still easy to press, though we can't vouch for its durability - home buttons on iGadgets are probably the quickest wearing bit. Of course how quick depends on your usage but, over time you may start experiencing missed clicks. Unfortunately, the only way to tell if Apple has fixed the problem is to wait and see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The position of the hardware controls on the sides of the mini tablet is identical to that of the big iPad. The Power/Lock key is at the top, on the right, and there's a hardware mute switch and volume buttons on the right side of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The switch can be set to either act as a Ringer/Silent switch or as a Screen rotation lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on top is the 3.5mm audio jack. Apple has kept the positioning of the jack and haven't moved it to the bottom like they did with the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, there's the new Lightning connector and two grills for the stereo loudspeakers (yep, there's a speaker under each grill, unlike the iPhone 5 where one of the grills is for the microphone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What makes the Lightning cable unique is bilateral symmetry. There's no 'up' and 'down' like with regular USB cables, you can plug it either way. The port carries out charging and data transfer duties and - with the appropriate adapter - can do TV out and read photos off USB storage (but no other files).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back and sides of the iPad mini are a single slab of aluminum, which is pretty cool. You get a choice of two colors - Black/Slate and White/Silver - but be warned, the back is a fingerprint magnet and it's especially visible on the black model. So, you'll have to clean it often, but the feel of aluminum is great to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is in the top left corner at the back. It's quite close to the edge, but there's no danger of putting your finger on the lens regardless of how you hold the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of colors, the color of the bezel on the front matches the color on the back, unlike the previous Apple tablets, where the back was always gray regardless of the color of the front panel.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini uses a 7.9" IPS LCD display of 1024 x 768 pixel resolution (4:3 aspect ratio, 162ppi pixel density). It's the same resolution as the iPad 2, but scaled down. The pixel density is way below the Retina mark (and we mean the lower threshold Apple sets for tablets), though the display is noticeably sharper than the one on the iPad 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we delve into the issue of image quality, here's a table with some vital specs for the screens of multiple devices. This table should make it easier to compare screen sizes (comparing diagonal size doesn't give you accurate results) and sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The table shows that you get over four times the screen surface area of an iPhone 5, though at half the pixel density. Compared to the iPad 2, you get around 20% more pixels per inch, though the big iPads have 50% more screen surface area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Apple iPad mini display matrix compared to that of the iPhone 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In short, browsing the web on an iPad mini gives you loads more room compared to an iPhone. Compared to a big iPad, if you hold the mini in landscape mode you'll more or less see the top half of a page that an iPad 2 would show in full.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, 7" Android tablets do have noticeably smaller screen real estate, so it's not fair to call the iPad mini a 7-inch tablet. Then again, if you use it the iPad mini for watching videos (which are mostly in 16:9 aspect), you would only be getting 13% of extra screen estate as the old-school ratio of its screen isn't particularly well suited for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's talk image quality. On an iPad 2 you can easily see pixels in text and icons, while pixels on the iPad mini screen are less noticeable. Still, when you put it next to an iPad 3/4 you see a world of difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, most people don't have a mini and an iPad 4 side by side, but it's quite likely that they'll have an iPhone 4/4S/5 if they have an iPad mini and each time they move from their phone to their tablet, they'll be reminded of the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini's screen offers less accurate color rendering and lower contrast compared to the Google Nexus 7. On the up side, it is brighter and it has better viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the testing process over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini screen is generally good, but somewhat short of the excellence we expect from Apple. Given the pricing (and ignoring other considerations), an iPad 2 is a viable alternative to getting a mini, but the smaller tablet has the advantage in screen quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for Android competitors, the only real downside of the iPad mini screen is the lower resolution, which might be a deal breaker for some and an acceptable compromise for others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini measures 200 x 134.7 x 7.2 mm and weighs 308g (312g for the LTE version). It's the slimmest tablet currently on the market by quite a margin. It's a bit too wide, though, - wider than a typical seven incher - and depending on how big your hands are it might be slightly uncomfortable to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handling of the Apple iPad mini is much improved compared to the big iPads. A big part of that is the weight - the small tablet is less than half the weight of the big one. This makes it very easy to hold in one hand and use with the other, something that gets tiring pretty quickly with the full-size Apple tablets. Even though it's quite thin, the smoothly beveled edges mean you don't get a sharp metal edge poking you in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini is easy to use on the go - it's slim, lightweight and portable. It fits into pants pockets and while that's not all too comfortable, it means that it will fit into coat pockets, purses and small bags. In comparison, for an iPad 4 you'll need something that can pretty much fit a MacBook Air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest downside of the iPad mini in the handling department is the 135mm of width. This might be a bit too much for you to wrap your hand around but it can't be helped, the 4:3 screen is anything but narrow. Still, the mini is light enough for you to rest it on your hand and there's enough grip to hold it in place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Landscape operation is also quite comfortable, especially if you enable the split keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while the full-sized tablets are probably relegated to at-home duties, the iPad mini will see a lot of mileage, potentially making it the iPad of choice for many people.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iOS 6 at the helm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iOS 6 on the Apple iPad mini looks just like you'd expect. It's an upscaled version of the iPhone UI, with subtle changes to make better use of the available space here and there. When compared to a full-sized iPad you'll notice that the icons on the iPad mini's display are smaller to compensate for the lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video of the iPad mini in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini lockscreen has the familiar "slide-to-unlock" slider with a shortcut alongside it to go straight to the Photos app. Double-pressing the home button reveals music controls and a virtual volume rocker. There's no shortcut to open the camera, but given that tablets (even the smaller ones) aren't exactly the best devices for taking snaps on the go that's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock the iPad mini you dive right in to the simplicity of iOS. Unlike Android, its interface is one consists of a single layer, which has all your apps placed in a grid. You can reorder the apps however you like or place them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is the one place where things get a little deeper. Most of the apps' settings are placed here instead inside the apps themselves. You can view settings for iCloud, Safari, Messages, Photos and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode, which came as a part of iOS 6 gives you further control over your notifications. If turned on, it will mute incoming calls or alerts. You can allow calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval during which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND mode and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the other iOS 5+ devices, the iPad mini offers a pull-down Notification center a la Android. It looks rather awkward covering just a part of the screen, but that doesn't cause any issues with usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access the Notification Center from anywhere in the interface and even in games or apps. It does pause the app beneath, so there's no way you accidentally stray off the road while playing Need for Speed.You can set the behavior for the notification from each individual app. The system is pretty flexible and configurable now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ideally there would have also been some connectivity toggles in the notification center, but we'll have to wait a bit longer for that we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a pleasure working with iPad-friendly version of iOS on the smaller screen. The mini handling is boosted by the lower weight and size of the device. It's also possible now to hold the device with one hand and scroll through menus with the other, something almost impossible on a larger iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Operating certain apps and games feels better on the iPad mini, too. Games with dual-dial controls can be problematic on the full-blown 9.7" iPads as they require you to stretch your fingers quite a lot or at least constantly readjust you grip.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini is driven by the Apple A5 chipset, which has two 1 GHz Cortex-A9 cores and a dual-core PowerVR SGX543 graphics chip. The amount of on-board RAM is 512 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't say we're thrilled with this kind of hardware - it is around two years old now and not up to speed compared to the quad-core Tegra inside the Nexus 7. The amount of RAM isn't impressive either, given that even the iPhone reached the 1 GB milestone already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So without further ado, here go the benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start off with Geekbench, which puts the chipset through all kinds of stress tests like processing per core, graphics performance, memory performance, etc. The iPad mini hits last place here, behind its hardware twin the iPad 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark focuses on the dual-core PowerVR GPU inside the iPad mini. The Egypt 2.5 off-screen test shows the GPU's raw power as it pushes a preset amount of pixels and ignores the screen resolution. The iPad mini got 14.5 frames per second, which isn't anything special in tablet terms but did beat the Samsung Galaxy S III and HTC One X.It's no surprise that the iPad 2 got an identical result here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen test shows what framerate the CPU averages on the screen's native resolution, in this case 1024 x 768 pixels. The low native resolution helped the iPad mini do 24.3 fps, extending its advantage over the Android flagships, which have more pixels to deal with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt on-screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We move on to browser-based benchmarks. SunSpider and BrowserMark focus on JavaScript and HTML 5 performance. The iPad mini is running the latest iOS 6 so it should produce fine results here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider showed an okay score for the iPad mini, just behind the ICS-running LG Optimus G. In BrowserMark the iPad mini managed to beat the LG superphone but didn't come close to the iPhone 5 and iPad 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Siri on the iPad mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple's virtual assistant Siri is fully functional on the iPad mini. Since iOS 6 Siri speaks new languages too: Canadian English and French, Spanish, Italian, the varieties of German, Italian and French spoken in Switzerland, Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese. These are also supported in the satnav app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Support for POI search is supposed to get wider. Assistance with restaurant booking is part of Siri's new set of skills. It will find you exactly the restaurant you are looking for and filter the results based on user reviews. You can run impressively detailed searches based on food type, location, outdoor, pool, price range, ratings, etc. This feature is not available in every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the much-touted features is Siri's new-found flair for sports. It can answer lots of questions and isn't limited to game scores. History, stats, player bios, player comparison, teams, records, etc. Siri should be able to return most of the info right onto its own screen, without switching over to the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same applies to movies. You will get all of your movie-related answers right inside the Siri window - anything about actors, directors, awards, movie stats, premieres and tickets, reviews, trailers, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other new thing Siri can do is launch apps. Yes, it does look like one of those features that should have been there from the beginning, but better late than never, right? You can also have Siri update your Facebook and Twitter as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple announced it's working with various car manufacturers - BMW, GM, Mercedes, Land Rover, Jaguar, Audi, Toyota, Chrysler, Honda and others - to integrate Siri tightly with the car's audio systems. We are still a few years away from the moment when that collaboration bears fruit, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook is tightly integrated in iOS. It even goes deeper than Twitter did in iOS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already pointed out that Siri can do your status updates for you. There are dedicated shortcuts for Facebook and Twitter updates in the Notification center as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share photos on Facebook right inside the Photo app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Posting a picture on Facebook or Twitter is done through the familiar pop-up windows. For Facebook you can even customize the type of audience you wish to share the content with - close friends, family or any other group you've created.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the iPad is the same as the one on the iPhone - Contacts. It lists all of your contacts complete with multiple email, number, address and other fields. You can set different tones for each contact, work details and you have convenient send message and share contact shortcuts available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your contacts are automatically sync'd so that you instantly get them from your phone, be it an iPhone, Android, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like in Android you can sync your Facebook contacts with the phonebook. If you do, the system will search email and phone numbers, so it can link your contacts with their Facebook profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a successful Facebook link, the contact's picture, addresses, important dates, emails, phone numbers and websites will be updated. You will also get a new Facebook field with a shortcut to the contact's Facebook profile. It will load in the Safari browser however, not the dedicated Facebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Facebook albums and feeds do not appear in the phonebook. All Facebook events will appear in the Calendar though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini is the first Apple iOS device to feature stereo speakers. Unlike the dual-grille iPhones the mini actually features two speakers underneath a single grille. The change is immediately noticeable - music and videos sound deeper and richer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've preferred the speakers to be further apart though. It would've made more sense it they were on each side of the iPad mini as the stereo effect would be far more pronounced this way. Ideally, all tablets will have front-facing stereo speakers on each side of their displays, but that might go against Apple's design policies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We performed out loudspeaker test on it and it scored a Good mark. We don't see many people using the iPad mini as a playing station but it will do for the occasional movie on the couch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You find more details on the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iMessage and mail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPad mini comes with iMessage - it lets you exchange instant messages between iOS-running iGadgets (running iOS 5 or above) via Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages. The app stores all your messages within threads and offers options for mass delete and forwarding. There is a search field, MMS support (if you choose to attach a multimedia file) and character counter. iMessage gives you delivery reports too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini probably won't be your primary device for chatting on iMessage but it's very convenient that when you have an ongoing conversation on an iPhone you can simply continue it on your iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email supports multiple accounts (configurable in the Settings app) and offers Universal Inbox (showing all your mail at once). The Mail app also supports threads, email archiving and quick lookup of documents thanks to the integrated document viewer. There is also an Open Withâ?¦ option, offerings to handle your files with some of your installed apps (PDF reader, mobile office, iBooks, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In portrait mode the left bar with all your emails remains hidden until prompted while in landscape you get both the inbox/emails bar visible and the email you've opened is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a VIP list, and emails from people on the list will be delivered to a dedicated VIP mailbox and will appear highlighted in your standard inbox. You can also set a different notification regime for VIP emails - so they appear on the lockscreen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open your Inbox and hit the Edit button, you now have a Mark key alongside Move and Delete. You can now mass mark emails as read/unread or flag them as important. Unfortunately, a "Select All" option is still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are added to the text editing options as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold&amp;select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Notes app is exactly the same as before. You get the familiar split-screen layout with the notes you've saved on the left and the note edit screen on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your notes are also synced with iCloud so you won't have to worry about losing any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri-powered dictation is available in Notes, Email, iMessage and any app that supports it. It works just like on the iPhone 5 - hit the corresponding button your keyboard and start dictating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard on the iPad mini is exactly the same as on the larger iPads and knows the same tricks. You can undock the keyboard, which places it dead center on the screen. You can then move it up or down, depending on what's underneath and where you would like to place it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also split the keyboard in two by doing a simple pinch gesture on it or selecting it from the keyboard options. This feature was most useful on the 9.7" iPads but it's still nice to have here. You can adjust the position in split mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the iPad mini to be the most comfortable for typing of all Apple slates. Even in the default docked position handling the keys with both hands in portrait mode is pretty easy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos and Photo Sharing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Photos on the iPad mini are handled by the Photos app. The smaller tablet isn't as good at showing your images as its bigger brother and the low density of the screen is not much help either. Photos come out in full resolution (no downsizing) but you'd be hard-pressed to enjoy them at this pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the iPad mini is rich on eye-candy - you can pinch-zoom your way back to gallery view here and into single photo view. There is also a small thumbnail bar at the bottom for quick picture scrolling. You can select multiple pictures, delete them, copy them in other albums or share them. You can also preset a slideshow with adjustable transitions and music arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view photos by album, by picture (everything stacked in one place), view them in a slideshow sequence with the option to choose a track to go along with them. You can see the location of the photos in Map view and see faces on the photos (you'd need Aperture or iPhoto on a computer to use Faces).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 6 brings Shared Photo Stream to the iPad. It acts like a social sub-network, built right into the Photos app. You will be able to choose what pictures to share and which people to share with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo Stream works really well and is very simple to set up. You can invite users you want to share your Photo Stream with via email or get invited.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback isn't the iPad mini element<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini isn't the best device to watch videos on - you need iTunes to upload content, the screen is the awkward 4:3 aspect ratio, the device cannot stand on its own and the supported video formats are quite limited. There is not even DivX or XviD support (out of the box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPad mini supports playback of MOV files all the way up to 1080p resolution, but has some specific requirements for bitrate. We threw a few 1080p trailers in iTunes and only half of them made it through the sync into the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, by using a third-party player you can upload clips via the iTunes File Sharing service and upload any video file. It turned out this way we had much fewer limitations to worry about and we managed to play all MOV/MP4 files up to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPads generally aren't the best devices for watching videos - the constrains of the ecosystem, the limited video player and the unsuitable aspect make them notably inferior to their Android rivals in that department. With the iPad mini packing an even smaller screen things are looking even worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that if you still want to watch videos, the iPad mini will last for quite a while. In our test, it went for nearly 13 hours of SD video playback on a single charge.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPod music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music player on the iPad mini resembles the desktop iTunes using the split-screen interface to make best use of the large resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Organizing your music library is easy and there is the option to apply equalizers. Combined with the excellent audio quality (more on that to come), that makes the iPad a promising music tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music application also has its own search in addition to the general Spotlight search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you are mostly stuck with iTunes for uploading and downloading music content on your iPad. We hate to be forced to use a specific kind of software for uploading music tracks, but we already knew what we were signing for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use a work around for uploading your images (like Dropbox for example), but you'll have to use the basic sound player for that and that one has virtually no features whatsoever. It's unlikely that Apple would revise its policy so if you hate the iTunes dependency, then you already know to stay away from iGadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy and download tracks straight off the iTunes Store on the iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple users used to this way of doing things will find no problems here - if you're not opposed to using iTunes exclusively the experience is actually really handy and you can fill up on music in no time with the only required thing would be a stellar internet connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Typically great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The shrinking has has caused the Apple iPad mini to lose some of its voice and it fared a bit worse than the iPad 3 and the iPad 2 in our audio quality test. However, the good news is that those two were virtually perfect, so slightly worse than them still qualifies as awesome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini is impressively loud and while its signal-to-noise, dynamic range and stereo-crosstalk readings aren't as good as those of its bigger brother, they still remain great. The distortion is basically non-existent ,too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the readings remain unaffected when you connect a pair of headphones, save for the the tiny amount of intermodulation distortion that creeps in. Amazingly the stereo crosstalk reading remains unaffected, which almost never happens with mobile devices.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 MP iSight camera goes smaller<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini features a 5 MP iSight camera capable of producing stills of 2592x1944 pixel resolution. It features Geo-tagging (Wi-Fi location on the Wi-Fi-only model), touch focus and face detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is as basic as it gets, offering very little controls outside of the virtual shutter key. The other available option lets you switch between the back and the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images captured with the iPad mini turned out good. Colors are decent and accurate and the level of detail is pleasing for a 5 megapixel shooter. Considering that this is a tablet and you probably won't rely on it as a primary shooter, we are tempted to say that it even over-delivers here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini's iSight camera is capable of producing 1080p videos@30fps. Although not the go-to device for making home movies it's still a nice addition to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface borrows from the camera one - you get one shutter button, a switch to front-facing camera toggle and that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have a bitrate of around 18 Mbps with a fps of 29. Audio has a bitrate of 65 Kbps with a sampling rate of 44 kHz but it is mono, as with all iDevices so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are smooth and detail is good enough. Automatic exposure struggles at times and we found the resolved detail to be insufficient at times - videos don't look as sharp as on the iPhone 5, for example. The iPad mini also features video stabilization. It's more of a software gimmick as it is real hardware stabilization but it does remove some of the shake, which is useful when shooting video with a tabet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini comes in either Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi + Cellular options. Wi-Fi is dual-band meaning both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands work fine. The mini also covers all Wi-Fi standards - a/b/g/n.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cellular version of the iPad has two different flavors. There's a quad-band GSM/HSPA one with dual-band LTE and a CDMA version with quad-band GSM/HSPA and penta-band LTE. The cellular connectivity on the iPad mini is used for data only, so native calls are out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's stereo Bluetooth 4.0, nano-SIM support (for the cellular units) and the lightning connector, which corresponds to USB 2.0.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Safari browser does a solid job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Although not Retina, the iPad mini screen does a good job at web browsing on the go. The device's form factor is another key bonus here, allowing you to browse without feeling like your hands are going to fall off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those concerned with the lower resolution, we have to say that pages mostly look good on the 7.9" iPad mini display. Text is usually readable even at the most zoomed out point and yes, there's no comparing the mini to the iPad 3 or iPad 4, but it doesn't do much worse than the Nexus 7, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multiple tabs support and the auto fill and password managers improve the usability of the Safari browser greatly. The pop-up menus appear as small windows on the screen itself rather than occupying the display things are even more desktop-like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share pages directly from the share menu in Safari. Sharing options include Mail, iMessage, Twitter and Facebook. Reading list allows you to save pages for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reader mode is a great way of reading longer articles in Safari. It strips the web content of fancy fonts and ads and presents you the essential stuff that's really easy on the eye. It works alright on most pages but you won't find it available as an option on all pages. For those cases there are always other options - like Evernote Clearly and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users that are used to browsing on a full-grown iPad will immediately appreciate the comfort of the smaller, lighter iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini can browse the web for 9 hours and 5 minutes, which is very impressive. It was only outdid by the Motorola RAZR MAXX and the iPhone 5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple Maps on a tablet screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini comes with Apple's new mapping service along with voice-guided navigation, courtesy of Siri, faster vector graphics, a cool 3D Flyover mode but and a long list of missing or otherwise not very functional shortcomings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app works much better on the iPad mini than on the iPhone 5, as it allows much more content to fit on the screen. It's especially better for browsing cities and enjoying Flyover mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation will work even on the lockscreen or in the background. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also sourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road. Keep in mind that only the cellular iPad mini has GPS on tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a catch, though - the Wi-Fi only version of the iPad mini doesn't have a built-in GPS, so navigation is out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Flyover mode is a great bonus for your viewing pleasure. When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is extremely limited, but hopefully more areas will be added later on. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While rich on eye-candy, Apple's Maps are still behind the curve in terms of functionality. It's shortcomings have been well documented - the 3D graphics aren't the most accurate around and the neither is the map data itself. As you might remember even Tim Cook himself suggested you try the competitors' products until they improve.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>App and iTunes stores<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple App Store is the great looking app repository that offers the largest collection of tablet-optimized apps on the market right now. As of iOS 6 it has a slightly different manner of operation. Firstly, you won't be prompted to enter your password when you just update apps. Secondly, you can see the change log in the Updates screen without actually opening the info screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's now an All Categories toggle in the top left corner. The Categories tab at the bottom has been replaced with Genius, which lists apps you might like on the basis of the apps you've already seen or downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, after you buy or update apps you will no longer be kicked back to the homescreen - you can continue browsing the store. You can launch apps you've already installed from within the store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes Store also features the new interface, which is way cleaner with a more images. Facebook reviews are available here too so you can check out what people are saying about an album, movie, etc. You can also preview just about everything. Ringtones, alert tones, movies, etc. can all be checked out or listened to before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Well, Apple is now offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo Booth and FaceTime<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo Booth is almost the same as the Mac OS X Photo Booth - you can use the front or the rear camera to take funny pictures of yourself or a friend. There are only 8 different filters here, but the results are pretty funny nonetheless. The only downside is that using the front camera (which is more natural) gives you 1.2MP results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has very simple interface - you have nine squares where you can see the different filters applied in real time. You choose a filter and tap on it. Now you can take a picture, change the camera or review/delete your previous Photo Booth photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini has a 1.2 MP front-facing camera, which is capable of 720p FaceTime video calls. FaceTime works over Wi-Fi and a cellular connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty minimal, you get the opposite's video feed, a mute, end and switch camera toggles and a small window of your own video feed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps on the iPad mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Calendar on the iPad uses the screen estate very well giving you split-screen intraface - the date on one side and the agenda view on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view your events and tasks by day, week, month, year or as a list. You can also opt to view appointments from your iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo, etc. or all of them at the same time. There's a handy option to view Birthdays too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which calendars you want to see - Facebook, iCloud, Exchange, etc. Your iCloud calendar can be divided into many categories like personal, work, birthdays or you can choose to have multiple calendars for different people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an event hasn't changed. You have the usual array of options - you can choose a date or dates, hours, to set an alarm, to add invites, location, etc. Finally you can choose to which calendar you want to save the event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The separate Reminders app has a simple interface but it does a nice job. You can set to be reminded on a day or at a location (you'll need a GSP-enabled iPad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a reminder sets off, you see it as a standard notification - on your lockscreen, the Notification Center and the homescreen (as a banner or a pop-up).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app on the iPad mini is the usual affair. You can add multiple alarms (though we don't see many people using an iPad as an alarm clock) and they get displayed in a nice time-table grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini also comes with Stopwatch and Timer, built into the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks really comes into its own on the 7.9" screen of the iPad mini. If there ever was an iPad to read books on, the mini is it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from iBooks you can also open PDFs. You can choose different fonts, reduce and increase the text size, change the background and play around with brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini LCD isn't the best for reading books, though. It's no E-Ink and will eventually hurt your eyes if you spend too long time with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipboard is a great app for enjoying the web through a magazine-styled layout. It really shines on the Retina-ready iPads but it isn't all that bad on the iPad mini. Scrolling through apps is smooth and pictures look good, even at this resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing games on the iPad mini is an awesome experience. For one, accelerometer-controlled games are actually possible to play for more than 30 seconds. Tilting the larger and way heavier iPads for longer was bordering on a proper work-out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, those games that require two-handed operation (particularly the ones that use two dials) are way easy to play on the mini. But the iPad mini is not just the best iPad for gaming - helped by the huge selection of titles available in the App Store it might be the best gaming tablet there is.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, then. Before we have our say on the iPad mini, we'll let the numbers talk. Three million tablets sold over the opening weekend easily beats the record set in March by the then new iPad. It's a combined figure of course for the two new slates - big and small - but it's quite likely for the iPad mini to claim responsibility for the better part of the traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the novelty factor for one - a truly portable Apple tablet at long last against an iPad 4 that hardly brings anything new over the now discontinued iPad 3. No doubt, the mini is the new iPad, and it's not beyond belief that it may end up as the iPad of the future. Looking at the third and fourth generation of Cupertino slates, it's easier to imagine an iPad 5 with a Retina display in the mini form factor than another incremental upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a second thought - would it have made sense to simply launch the iPad mini with a high-res screen and an A6 chipset instead of releasing another full-size slate just months after the previous model? From the perspective of iPad 3 owners, it most certainly would.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to guess what's on Apple's mind. At least a little pressure from cheap Google-powered tablets must have been felt. Or they may be simply encouraging users to have both sizes - one as a stay-at-home, the other for outings. That's more like Apple actually. They'd rather go on and on about portability and carefully avoid the subject of affordability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because, let's face it, the iPad mini is way more expensive than the likes of the Nexus 7 and the Kindle Fires. Whatever the stunts that allow Google and Amazon to charge less than $ 200.00 on their tablets, they at least have the decency of putting an HD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At $199 for a 16 GB version the Nexus 7 is a steal but even a 32 GB variant will set you back much less than a baseline 16 GB iPad mini. On the other hand, a bigger 8.9" screen on the Kindle Fire HD is also cheaper than the cheapest iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Asus Google Nexus 7 ? Amazon Kindle Fire HD ? Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In an ideal world, the iPad mini would've been out at least a year ago and competing against something like the Samsung Galaxy 7.7. But when it gets to tablets you wouldn't call it an ideal world unless you're... Apple. Yes, Cupertino has been calling the shots forever and we're at a point where for a tablet to sell it either has to be dirt cheap or sport a bitten apple at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung P6800 Galaxy Tab 7.7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there we are. The iPad mini is nothing more than an iPad 2 with a smaller screen and premium finish. The A5 chipset is two-generations old and the mini has fewer pixels on a bigger screen than the closest Android-powered rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the iPad mini is the biggest thing to come from Apple this season - after an underwhelming iOS 6, after an iPhone 5 and an iPad 4 that are not exactly making the previous versions obsolete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a beautiful device too, we'd go ahead and call it the best looking Apple tablet to date. But portability is by far its biggest asset. Enough probably to make millions of users buy the mini and keep their bigger iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only because it can go wherever they go, it's for things like gaming too. Videos suck on the small, low-res, 4:3 screen; web and picture browsing, as well as reading, are a lot better on Retina. But playing games is where the iPad mini is at its best. The screen size is right in terms of how far your thumbs can reach and accelerometer control is a lot more sensible than on a full-size iPad. And we mean for more than a couple of minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But does this make the iPad mini a niche device for gaming and commuters? The competition would certainly like to think so. But even they must realize it's too good to be true. We can take people who are committed to Apple in one way or another - an iPhone or an iPad, most likely both - out of the equation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's just become harder for the neutral user about to decide on their first ever tablet. And that alone is a win for Apple already. We're not saying it's fair. But the choice is really between sensible and fancy, cheaper and apple at the back.</paragraph>
