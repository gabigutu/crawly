			<paragraph>The new Siemens Class S is not just a "boring" mobile phone meant for work. Apart from luxury elegancy, brilliantly elaborated functions and fast data transfers, it offers an excellent MP3 player and a high-class camera. And what about the price? It's so low that it is hard to believe.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All Siemens mobile phones from the S class are famous for their excellent working features. In particular, the latest S65 model has become very popular for its decent outlook, large display, superb phonebook service, calendar and messages, as well as for its Bluetooth and marginal orientation towards multimedia functions. Obviously, the manufacturer has decided to supplement it with several entertainment applications in order to keep the pace with the competition. And here we have Siemens S75 - a music mobile for managers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Siemens S75</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75 looks very luxurious. Its front cover is made of black shiny plastic material, touched with chromium plated elements: the frame around the display, the decorative band above the metal grid of the speaker, the manufacturer's logo and the rectangular frame of the control button. The entire front side of the device is flanked with silver-like plastic material, which is trimmed in the middle part of both sides, thus making the phone look narrower. L</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Fortunately, the shiny black surface is not so smooth as to make fingerprints stand out too much</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Business style - black in a combination with chromium elements</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looked aside Siemens S75 reminds a sandwich. Both top and bottom courses are silver. In between them there is a dark grey section, in which several elements are mounted. On the right side of the phone you will find buttons for volume control of the earphones, while on the left side the camera release button and the music player button are to be found. In the bottom part of the left side you will also see a dark glass, which is basically the infrared port. The bottom side of the device is occupied by the system connector, which is identical to the system connectors of the rest of the models from the 65/75 series. Above the connector you will find a large memory card slot. To open it you will need a pen or a similar sharp object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  &nbsp;Phone's sides ? the right one hosts two buttons... ? ... as well as the left one</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The memory card slot is located above the system connector ? removing the memory card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top of the phone there is a small slot, which reminds an eyelet hold. However, it is nothing else but a bracket for the car holder. If you hang Siemens S75 on your neck, it will be swinging upside down as the real eyelet hold is located on the bottom side of the device, below its removable back cover. The back cover is entirely silver. Below it you will find an 820 mAh Li-Ion battery, which is said to support up to 300 hours of stand-by performance and 300 minutes of phone calls. By this very moment I have been intensively testing Siemens S75 for full two days. Nevertheless, the battery indicator is still half full.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: in the course of writing this review I finally managed to discharge the phone completely</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The infrared port is located in the very bottom part of the phone's left side ? holder bracket is on the top ? a detailed view at the side buttons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75 features a camera located in the upper area of its back cover. Here you will find the lens in a chromium-plated frame, a flash LED and a tiny square mirror for self-portraits. As usual in all Siemens models, the back cover of the phone also hosts the uncovered and rather ugly external antenna connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The removable cover takes a major part of the back side of the phone ? ...hidden underneath are both the battery and the SIM card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a solid construction. It did not creak once no matter how hard I would twist or press it. This fact comes to supplement the good impression this luxury phone gives at first sight. The dimensions of the phone (103 x 47 x 19 mm) and its weight of 99 g send it into the category of medium big and medium heavy mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera lens, mirror and flash diode are elegantly put into the same frame</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Click, click, clap, clap<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alike the front cover, the buttons of the keypad are made of shiny black plastics. They are separate and small, but at the same time stand out enough to significantly assist touch control. Press is relatively firm, but at the same time quite loud. I myself find it so loud that I fear it may disturb a lot, if the phone is used in quiet environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   The buttons of the keypad are quite comfortable to use, but still pretty loud</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the SXG75 model, Siemens S75's control key is in a distinct chromium rectangular frame. Selected options are confirmed by a press on its middle part. On the sides there are two context keys and a standard pair of green and red receivers. Besides, on the left there is an additional key, which opens music files, and on the right - a key for direct access to the internet browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Keys bulge notably above the surrounding surface ? keypad is backlighted in white</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the loud clicks, the keypad is brilliant. In general, keys are easy to manage, even if quite small. Fast SMS writing is not a problem. The keypad is backlighted in white, but it is only the legends of the keys that shine. Side buttons have been smartly done as well. They do not need to be pressed strongly, but are somewhat difficult to find by touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>12 icons with better design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you switch on the phone, it asks you - as usual - whether you are serious in your intention. If you confirm, a stand-by image appears on the display. Hereafter everything - from the battery and signal strength indicators up to the legends of the context keys and the operator's logo - is the same like in other Siemens models. A certain modification is notable in the date and time details, which are no more displayed in the bottom bar, but in the upper part of the screen, below the bar with the state icons. Instead, the bottom bar is occupied by a help link, which provides various types of information: from details about the functions that have been assigned to individual numeric keys to the number of missed events/messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Main display with various wallpapers ? help link in the bottom bar (key number 5 is a shortcut for the flash function)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All those, who own a Siemens model of the 65 collection, should be prepared for a little surprise, when they enter Siemens S75's menu. Its icons are nicely colored, animated and pretty elegant. What's more, there are not 9, but 12 of them. This extension is explained with the special attention the manufacturer has paid to games, the multimedia files player and - quite surprisingly - the alarm clock. If you do not feel comfortable using the matrix menu, you can choose a view with large font, in which icons are displayed individually, accompanied by a large text legend, and can be scrolled vertically. The second style may come in handy in a car or in case that the sight of the user is not very strong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main menu in a matrix view... ? ...and displayed through separate icons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the user interface can be adjusted. You can change not only the wallpaper on the display, but also the entire color scheme. Siemens S75 offers 5 color schemes. After a certain period of inactivity, which can be set, a huge digital or analog clock appears on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Preinstalled color themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the display of the S75 model is identical to those in Siemens CX75 or M75. It is not bad, but to my opinion, a manager phone like this deserves to be equipped with a display of a higher, more luxury class. Its resolution of 132 x 176 pixels looks quite poor, when compared to the competition. On the other hand, its excellent readability under direct sunlight is worth a compliment. Siemens S75 is able to show 262K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Display is perfectly readable under direct sunlight ? a huge digital clock, which is easy-to-see without backlighting, appears on the display after a certain time of inactivity</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite of the implied innovations the structure of the interface and the control system of Siemens S75 do not differ that much from previous models. Each key of the numeric keypad can be assigned a phone number or a particular function, which gets open when the relevant key is long-pressed. The function allocated on the right context key in a stand-by mode is possible to customize. Also correct for the up, left and right ways of the control button. The down way of the control button is reserved for access to the phonebook, while the left context key is supposed to serve the "inbox" section. In this section you will find a list of all missed events, calls, newly received messages etc. It is a truly smart solution, as everything is located in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;A list of missed events and newly received messages ? calls list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To enter the main menu press the middle part of the control button. To search it - use numbered tags directly or select and confirm each tab separately. The device responds immediately. Those used to searching Siemens menus by vertical moves of the joystick may run into difficulties. Here there are various extended tabs, which require the use of horizontal moves. Besides, the manufacturer has abandoned the system, in which the right way button confirms options and the left way one takes you a step backwards. In Siemens S75 you will need to press the middle of the control button for confirming and use the right context button for a move backwards. If you are used to press the red receiver, you will find yourself straight back in the stand-by mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The red button will take you back to the main display from java applications as well. In my case, every time I approached this step, the phone would die out. So I was frequently forced to pull out the battery and restart the device. I am sorry to say that the same problem occurred several times with other applications too. On the other hand, Siemens offers firmware upgrading, which could probably relieve the shortages mentioned above. In any case, the newest firmware in Siemens S75 we are testing is labeled 15.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Siemens does not provide voice control. Instead, it offers the users the possibility to set together a menu of their own with the functions they used most frequently. Once set, this menu can be customized to be accessed through the right context key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Useful tabs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let me now make some observations on phone calls. First of all, let's fill up the phonebook with contact names. For whom prefers to avoid delays implied by manual entering, they can download the latest version of Mobile Phone Manager - service software available on the CD that is delivered with the phone. This software enables synchronization with Outlook in a PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apparently, the capacity of the phonebook depends on nothing else, but the size of the currently available memory space. The status indicator reports that the phonebook can still fit in more than 500 names, without giving any particular limit. The phonebook of Siemens S75 has undergone one significant change in comparison to the models of the 65 series - it's made of 5 tabs, which are open through the horizontal ways of the control key. The first one gathers all contacts, which have been saved in the phone. The second includes groups, the third shows a list with all active users logged into instant messaging, the forth shows the list of contacts on the SIM card, and in the fifth one a list of most frequently used contacts is automatically created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Phonebook - all contacts are located in the first tab ? groups tab ? there are no numbers saved on the SIM card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs are also used when entries are viewed or edited. In the first one you will find general information like name, phone number, picture. In the second one there are private contact details (phone numbers, email address, street address...). The third one includes company contacts, the forth one is reserved for additional private details (group, notes, birth date...), and the last one features the so called "Online status" (ID users for instant messaging and push to talk). In result, each name can be assigned up to 43 fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Contact view ? editing entries</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Callers can be differentiated by a particular ringtone, a picture or even by a video record. Regrettably, the caller's picture or video do not appear in a full-screen mode, but in a tiny thumbnail. Besides, videos are only run once, which is a pity. Each group can be assigned a special picture and ringtone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Ringing can be accompanied by a picture ? or a video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is very well organized. Names are searched through gradual writing of their initial letters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phone jukebox<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ringtones offer a surprisingly extensive customization options. Both each group and each contact name can be assigned with a ringing melody of their own. What's more, the correspondent melody is played both when a call and a message come in. Apart from polyphonic melodies, you can also use MP3 files. If you want to apply a longer MP3 file as a message alert, you may want to define the number of the seconds from the file that should be played. Alerts in the calendar and the alarm clock can also be set to use a music file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special attention has been paid to vibration. The phone offers 6 types of vibration. The trick in Siemens S75 is that you can set up a different vibration for messages and calls. This way, for example, the phone may vibrate when calls come in, but remain quiet, when a message is received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringtones can be changed instantly with the available profiles. To silence the entire device you need to long-press the asterisk. Ringtones can be modified any time using the buttons on the right side of the phone. When you press those buttons, ringing melodies are played in the volume mode that is currently set. Unfortunately, the same happens - even if illogical - when silent mode is activated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Profiles menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringtones are never played in full volume straight away, but are introduced with a quiet start of approximately three seconds. Ringing can also be set up to gradually increase its intensity. A real surprise for me was the sound performed by Siemens S75, which is rich, with sonorous high frequencies and good bass elements, and it no more gives cheap impression, as it used to be in former Siemens models. Sound volume is more than good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I praise Siemens for the high quality of the sound playback during phone calls. Certain minor resonances can be overheard when the loud handsfree is setup at maximum volume.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent music phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The high quality of the sound performance is particularly important for music fans. We recommend that you listen to music files through the earphones delivered together with the phone, which are of the plug-in type. There is a microphone and a button on the supplying cable, through which calls are accepted or ended. In general, the sound produced by the earphones is not bad, but its bass elements could have been a little bit more intensive. Siemens S75 music player lacks equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Earphones, delivered with the phone, play well</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume is controlled through the buttons located on the right side of the phone. On the left side there is a pause/play music button (if you use this button to stop playing, a second press on it gets you back to playing from the moment, at which the playback was interrupted). All these buttons are inactive if the keypad is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main keypad also features a music button, which provides direct access to music files stored in the gallery with multimedia files. The exact title of the gallery is "Media Player". It has four tabs - the first includes music files, the second one - playlists, the third one is reserved for pictures, and the forth one - for videos. When you enter Media Player, the phone checks out memory space and updates the list of all available multimedia files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   List with music files in Media Player - music is ordered by both artist's name and album's title</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music files are ordered according to the information provided in ID3 tags by artist's name, album's title and genre. All music files, including those without complete ID3 tag, are kept in a folder called "All". When you select an artist, the player offers you a list with their albums followed by a list of the contents of those albums. To start playing, simply select a file. Use Right/Left way of the Control button to fast-forward and the Up/Down ways, if you want to switch to the previous/next file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; More fields - music files list ? videos ? pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five playing modes in the phone: 1. All files from a certain album are played. 2. One particular music file is played. 3. One file is played repeatedly. 4. A whole album or playlist is played repeatedly or randomly. 5. Several seconds from each music file are played only. Of course, there is no obstacle for creating playlists of your own. As you can see, Siemens S75 can fully substitute any MP3 player. What I miss here is a port that would let me plug in a standard pair of earphones using a 3.5mm jack. By the way, this draws back Siemens S75 against its competitors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Enough memory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75 has enough memory space thanks to RS-MMC slot and 27 MB of internal memory. Along with the phone you will also receive a 128 MB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multimedia files are displayed in Media Player. Picture previews are displayed in groups of three - both in landscape and full-screen mode. The same applies for video records. An example video is installed in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Video records can be played both in portrait and full-screen mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The directory structure can be opened with the a special browser, accessible from "My files" in the main menu. Once again, the designers have decided to use tabs - one for the internal memory, another one for the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Tabs in Siemens S75... ? ...and in the memory card</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo and video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that available memory space will be partly occupied by your pictures. Siemens S75 is equipped with a built-in megapixel camera, with maximum resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels. Lower resolution levels are available as well. The camera offers exposure compensation, a color mode, a night mode, a self-release option, white balance, and a digital zoom managed through the vertical ways of the control button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Camera's interface ? video camera interface ? camera setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark you may want to use the flash LED, which features a red-eye reduction system. The LED can be activated apart form the camera. In such case it serves as a flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75 shoots quite good pictures. Noise levels usually rise under clouded sky and poor light conditions. The macro mode of the phone is rather low quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Testing pattern and indoor pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      On a winter walk...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siemens S75 does not capture text very well</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is composed of two sections - one for the camera control options and one for the video camera application. Videos are recorded in 3GP format in a resolution of 176 x 144 pixels and thus can be used in MMS at the most. Videos' duration is limited to one and a half minute.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's now turn our attention from fun back to practical matters. Apart from voice communication, Siemens S75 offers a wide range of message exchange options. SMS, large EMS messages and MMS are supported, of course. Emails too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Message menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor has undergone no modifications, if compared to previous models. You can choose out of three font sizes, the smallest of which allows you to display 12 lines full of text. Countdown details about both used characters and used messages are displayed in the top. You may also want to assist the writing process by using T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Writing a SMS ? three font sizes available</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the SMS editor, the MMS one does feature certain changes. For example, it no more displays a layout of individual elements of the message. Instead, it gives you blank space, which you fill in with content via the context menu. The MMS editor is easy to get used to and you should have no fears to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Creating a MMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is a fixed part of the menu. Sent email messages are smartly separated from the text and the multimedia ones. You can download either entire emails or headers only. If you select the first option, you will surely appreciate the option of setting a particular limit of each downloaded email. It is possible to save a copy of each message in the mail server as well as delete messages straight away, once they have been transferred into the phone. Besides, you can choose, whether emails deleted from the phone should also be removed from the server, or a copy of theirs should be kept on it. Each email sent from Siemens S75 can be with an automatic signature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Sent emails ? viewing emails - Siemens works well with HTML format ? email setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75 is able to both send and receive emails with attachments.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Business and football<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features a rich extras menu. In a folder called Organizer you will find a calendar, which is able to memorize various reminding notes. There are 6 different kinds of notes available (memo, call, meeting, voice record, birthday, and holiday). Each note can be set to go with a legend, starting and end time, alarm, alarm advance and repetition interval. The calendar can be viewed by months, weeks and days. As you see, everything is more or less identical to the calendar of the 65/75 collection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Time organizer's menu ? various views of the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All events are gathered in a common view called Appointments. Further on in the Organizer menu you will find a standard task manager, a notes manager (notes' maximum length is 160 characters), a voice recorder (max. duration of 100 minutes), world clock and an option for access to remote synchronization through server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Task manager ? alarm clock ? WAP browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not the end of the extra functions though. In the main menu, under "Extra" you will also find a calculator, a measure converter, an instant messaging application, a stopwatch, a countdown function, and a very interesting innovation: a device, which counts the time between two particular dates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, java applications are also possible to access form the Extra folder. The phone has an installed blogging program, due to which you can share your experiences and pictures with other users in Internet, using 20six service. Moreover, the phone offers a program called Download assistant, which helps you download files from Internet, and an archiver program called Mobile Zip. Siemens S75 is also equipped with a browser for PDF and Office (DOC, XLS) files, but it manages very simple files only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Extras menu ? calculator ? java applications menu is quite big</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75 offers two games - Marble Madness and Real Football. In the first one you roll a marble on broken plates trying not to let it fall off. The second game is far more amusing - it is a variation of the football game we all know from PC. Even though graphics are adjusted to the phone's limited capabilities, playing this game is great fun, especially when you find yourself in the role of the provocative naked man, who runs around the playground and tries to escape from the police.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling marbles ? football </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Installing new games is not a problem. Siemens S75 supports Java 2.0. Jbenchmark results show that the speed of the phone's hardware equipment is pretty high:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New data solutions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfers through GSM network are backed up by both GPRS Class 10 and the fast data transfer technology EDGE Class 10. Close range connection is available via infrared port, Bluetooth or USB cable. Siemens S75 substitutes a hardware modem for PC, if necessary. If you fear installing of relevant controllers, use the service software Mobile Phone Manager, which is available on the CD included in the original package. Apart from managing internet connection, Mobile Phone Manager supports synchronization, manages SMS and MMS, allows recording of multimedia data into/from the phone, and backs up/updates data saved in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The data profiles setup in Siemens S75 is completely new. This seems to be the main reason for the unavailability of a relevant configuration on the manufacturer's website. This type of phone is not present in the menu of the smart T-Mobile configurator either. That is why it is necessary that all settings are done manually. In the Settings/Data exchange/Online settings option there is a list of configurations for various operators. Inside this list you will find a full range of setup options for all services and applications, so when you change SIM cards, you will need to simply switch to the required operator. In the first place, however, make sure that everything has been setup properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs have been used here, as well. The first one stores general information, the second one - the settings of all applications including 10 different java profiles for external applications. The third tab is reserved for server properties, and the forth one stores the properties of the access point. Obviously, settings starts from the forth tab. In the third one you only need to enter an IP address and a port. In the second tab you have to select the setup mode that corresponds to the third and the forth tab. The last necessary thing to do is to attach the properties of the relevant function (for example, the home page for the WAP browser or the access to the mailbox in case of setting up a new email account). Inexperienced users may find this section a little bit complicated in the beginning, but eventually, you will see that it is not chaotic at all. What's more, the system never asks you to insert twice one and the same detail and all necessary settings are done in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> New, unified settings of data profiles</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A serious competitor for Nokia 6230i<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75 is an excellent mobile phone with very well elaborated functions. Its unstable software can be considered its weakest spot, but there is still hope that the new firmware versions will set it right. You should not have any difficulties with Siemens S75 in everyday use - at least not the kind I had, as testing is always more challenging than common use. The phone is perfectly equipped to satisfy user's needs - from everyday work to music and entertainment. As for the megapixel camera, it fulfills its main duties - to take pictures and to record videos for MMS - quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S75's main competitor is Nokia 6230i, which is attractive for its better display and stereophonic radio. Nevertheless, Siemens S75 features better functions and is much cheaper. It is currently offered for 230 euro. Due to its price, it has become a competitor even for its "colleagues" - Siemens M75 and CX75. The first one still has a chance to find more fans due to its stable construction, but the second seems to fade away. There is no doubt that Siemens S75 is worth buying both for its brilliant design and smart applications.</paragraph>
