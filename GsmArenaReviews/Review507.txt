			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie has got to be the company's most straightforward attempt at product naming. Sure, it does have the mandatory 7-symbol alphanumeric model string at its tail, which means zip to the uninitiated, but unlike the piles of different Zenfone 2's, in this case a simple Selfie will suffice to describe the specific model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The title does well to advertise the smartphone's headline feature and in person the handset isn't shy showing it off either. Selfie could very well come before Zenfone with this one, as the front 13MP shooter has pushed the earpiece out of its customary central position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dual-tone front facing flash further emphasizes the device's priorities and is a bit of an exclusive feature. Setting aside rotating camera trickery like on the Oppo N3 and Honor 7i, you'd be hard pressed to find a smartphone with more than a single LED to shine at your face. The HTC Desire Eye is one, the only one perhaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point you'd be forgiven to think that the Zenfone Selfie is a one-hit wonder, but you'd be wrong. It can take on most any midrange competitor - after all, in 2015 the majority of those are equipped with the same Snapdragon 615 chipset anyway. Up to 3GB of RAM, a 5.5-inch FullHD display and a 13MP primary camera mean that the Selfie won't be shorthanded against all but the best-equipped rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the record, the model number of the Zenfone Selfie is ZD551KL. We have here the version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and there's a lesser 2GB/16GB option and surprisingly, both share the same model number. We're not big fans of the concept that the two numbers should be interdependent, but let's say that it allows for a more affordable base model, and that's a good thing where the Zenfone Selfie is positioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy that the Zenfone Selfie has a few features, which are slowly going into oblivion in the high end segment. The smartphone takes microSD cards for expansion, and it also has an easy-to-access swappable battery - batteries on Zenfone 2's have so far been guarded by a dozen screws despite the misleading removable back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as you see, the Asus Zenfone Selfie is an intriguing handset and we all but ready to put it through our customary review routine, with unboxing and hardware overview first up on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard-issue retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie comes in a standard retail box, its sleeve color matching the phone's back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box contents include an AC adapter rated at 5V/2A and less than a meter long USB-to-microUSB 2.0 cable and a headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone Selfie 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie measures 156.5 x 77.2 x 10.8 mm and that's 4mm taller than the already bulky Zenfone 2 ZE551ML. This minor change in dimensions was obviously called for by the large front camera assembly, and selfie enthusiasts are likely to be ok with the trade-off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of weight, there's no telling them 5.5-inch Zenfones apart. Whether it be the Zenfone 2, or the Laser, or the Selfie, they all tip the scales at 170g, which is not exactly light. Other selfie specialists like the HTC Desire Eye (5.2", 13MP, 154g) and Sony Xperia M5 (5", 13MP, 143) are noticeably lighter, but then the 6-inch 13MP Xperia C5 Ultra is even heftier at 187g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The smartphone shares the family's design guidelines closely. Based on the 5.5-inch Zenfone 2 that started it all this year, it's again larger than necessary for its diagonal, and pretty thick too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, Nov 10: The back cover is made entirely out of plastic and now that we got a retail review unit, it turned out quite solid - as solid as the one on the Zenfone 2. It doesn't give in under pressure and there is no squeaking to be heard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover on the Zenfone Selfie comes in three different textures, each with its own distinct colors. The Aqua Blue, Chic Pink and Pure White models have a matte finish. Surprisingly, the matte finish can get quite smudgy with fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Glacier Grey, Glamor Red and Sheer Gold on the other hand come with a faux brushed metal finish and they are great at keeping fingerprints away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are the Diamond White, Illusion Polygon Blue, Illusion Smooth Pink, which have an irregular, patterned surface though these were not available on our market. Of course, their availability might differ from region to region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One pain point valid for any of the colors is that the back covers are unusually hard to remove. You literally have to pry them open with force and you better have the nails for the job. On a positive note, we guess this would mean the back cover won't come off easily should you drop your phone accidentally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary camera resides in a central position flanked on either side by the laser autofocus window and the dual-LED flash. Underneath the camera is the volume rocker - LG style but with one key difference - without a power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Towards the bottom you'll find the speaker, but don't expect it to be as large as the mesh in the cover - it's about a third of that size and is positioned towards the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Selfie is your regular Zenfone affair with a twist. The top bezel has grown due to the large camera module and the 13MP shooter stares at you from a central position. The earpiece has been pushed out of the way to the right, while on the left is another duo of LEDs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5-inch IPS display is covered with the latest Gorilla Glass 4 and is reasonably easy to keep clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is the strip of capacitive buttons freeing screen space, but it also makes for a sizable bottom bezel. The additional chin below with a concentric circle pattern doesn't help either though it;s a nice design highlight and allows for instant recognition of the phone as Asus made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up top the phone is the power button - we gotta admit, it's one of the most uncomfortable positions possible on a phablet. Good thing then that the double-tap-to-wake feature will save from reaching all the way up to press it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the power button is the 3.5mm headphone jack, while the secondary mic pinhole is on the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port is on the bottom. It's upside down compared to the generally accepted position with the chamfers up. The supplied cable does take that into account, however, and has the USB marking on the right side so that it's facing up when you plug it in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the volume rocker on the back, power button up top and card slots under the hood, the sides are left completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the hand, the Zenfone Selfie feels much the Zenfone 2. It is large, but the curved back negates the issue and makes it quite comfortable to handle. The matte back provides enough grip and the rear volume buttons fall right in place for forefinger operation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Color-accurate 5.5-inch IPS panel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie comes with a 5.5-inch display with 1080p resolution, and that translates to a density of 403ppi. It uses an IPS LCD panel, which our microscope shot revealed to have a standard RGB subpixel arrangement, unsurprisingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie has very accurate color rendition with the average DeltaE being the impressive number of 4.2 (for the primaries plus black and white). The max DeltaE is 7.7 and that's mainly the rendition of white, which is slightly on the bluish side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The offered display tuning sliders allow you to improve that even further and by adding just a slight warmness to the display output we were able to achieve exceptional color accuracy - average deltaE of 3.3 and a max DeltaE of only 4.4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum brightness of the LCD panel (333nits) is not a good as it could be, but the relatively deep blacks (not as good as on the Lenovo K3 Note, but certainly in the top-tier among LCDs) allow the Zenfone Selfie to offer good contrast ratio of about 928:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the middle of the brightness slider, the brightness level is less than a third of the maximum brightness level, but that is also true for many other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimum brightness level is 22nits, which a lot more than the best we've seen so bear that in mind if you intend to use it frequently in pitch dark environment - this sort of light level might be unpleasant for the eyes in such conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie performed poorly in our sunlight legibility test perhaps due to the low maximum brightness. It's certainly far from good AMOLED screens in this respect (even the budget-minded Galaxy J7, for that matter), but the score is quite low even for an LCD panel, especially in 2015. Even the Zenfone 2 does somewhat better, and we're not quite sure why that is. The panels look very much the same, though the Selfie is indeed a bit dimmer, just not as much as to make that much of a difference in the sun.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie is well stocked on connectivity options. First off, there's quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE on both SIM cards and that's where the second card is capped. SIM 1 also gets quad-band 3G and a multitude of LTE bands, which are region dependent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac radios are on board as well, with Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is in its 4.0 version, there's a GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS, but no NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port comes with USB host support for attaching your choice of peripherals and MHL support. The headphone jack is the standard 3.5mm affair, allowing you to plug in just about any set of headphones out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a dedicated microSD card slot for storage expansion, which takes cards up to 128GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An FM radio receiver is provided for listening to music on the go without generating data traffic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone Selfie battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie comes with a 3,000mAh battery - a user-replaceable lithium polymer unit. The powerpack might very well be the same exact one as in the Zenfone 2, so we expected comparably unimpressive results. We weren't entirely right, it turned out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all starts with the twenty and a half hours of 3G call times - a good 4 and a half hours longer than the Zenfone 2 ZE551ML and a solid result on its own. It gets even better in the video playback test, where the Zenfone Selfie is good for 11 and a half hours of movie watching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good impression so far is marred by the web browsing longevity. When using the built-in browser, the Zenfone Selfie manages a lowly 6 and a half hours. Switch to Chrome, and the situation isn't as grim, but 7:43 hours is still only an average result. It's virtually the same number as the Zenfone 2 posted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the Zenfone Selfie does okay in the battery department, noticeably better than the Zenfone 2. Its overall rating of 63 hours in our proprietary test is far from record-breaking but it's not disappointing either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J7, for example, would last you a full 5 hours longer in video watching and a little over an hour longer in web browsing, but loses to the Selfie in call times. Another selfie specialist, the HTC Desire Eye, does about ten hours in both screen-on activities, but comes shorter in call endurance, too. Meanwhile, the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra trails the Selfie in all test disciplines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Make note that our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>You almost can't tell it's Android 5.0.2 underneath ZenUI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie comes with Android 5.0 out of the box, by now somewhat dated already. Google's OS has been the object of a total makeover by Asus, and the overlay is called ZenUI. It's not merely a skin too, instead the company has added a host of proprietary apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the power button all the way up on top, you'll be grateful there's a double tap to wake feature. Sending the phone back to sleep works by double-tapping on an empty area of the interface. If you're running a full-screen app, double-tapping on the notification bar will do the trick. You could disable the feature in settings, if you want that extra 1-2 percent of standby endurance, but we don't see ourselves doing that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a typical Asus affair. You're greeted by a time and weather widget, but also three shortcuts to the camera, dialer and messaging apps. They are customizable too, and you can assign any installed app of your choice to either of the three slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of notifications follows and, unlike some other Lollipop builds, double tapping on one takes you straight to the app that pushed it. Unlocking only works with an upwards swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom, the app drawer shortcut always in the middle. You cannot add more icons beyond these four, but there is folder support. Removing one does not rearrange the others, leaving an odd empty space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are preloaded Asus and Google folders, packed to the brim with a selection of applications from the respective companies - custom Asus apps in one, and the default Google apps in the other. When you install a new app, the phone will suggest a folder for its placement, aiming to keep things nicely organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch zoom lets you rearrange your homescreens, as well as select a default homescreen and add additional ones up to seven total, which can be cycled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding your finger on a homescreen brings a popup menu. It gives access to icon packs (of which there's only one on board, but the Play Store has plenty), scroll effects (a grand total of 11) and wallpapers. Additionally, it provides another way to get to the app drawer and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a theming engine with plenty of free themes available online, if you want to abandon the default cartoonish Asus theme, or go for an even more colorful one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has plenty of customization options itself. Grid size can be adjusted in the 3x3 to 5x5 range, with the latter making more sense on the 5.5-inch screen. Apps can be arranged alphabetically (the "All" setting), manually, or by frequent use, and you can also choose to only display the ones you downloaded yourself. Alternatively, you can have the Selfie group apps into folders according to their use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has seen extensive customization as well. A single-finger pull-down only brings up the notifications and no quick toggles. Side swiping removes the notifications and a "clear" button does away with all of them at once. A second swipe from just below the date reveals the toggles, and whatever notifications you have left get squished to the little space underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A two finger pull-down gets you straight to this state, which features a brightness slide with an auto mode, a 4-in-a-row set of quick tools and a 3x4 grid of toggles. Both the quick tools and the toggles can be chosen and rearranged, but you need to have exactly 4 tools and at least 8 toggles lined up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is the standard Lollipop style virtual rolodex, but with a twist. In between the typical "Close all" button and shortcut to the Apps section of the Settings menu, you get a pinning option. What that does, is keep the selected app in view regardless of taps on the capacitive buttons. It's a bit fiddly to get out of requiring a press-and-hold on the back and task switcher buttons simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick trigger is Asus' answer to the problem of handling large devices single-handedly. It's evoked with a double tap on the home button, provided you've enabled it first in settings. What it does is shrink the entire interface to a portion of the screen, which is resizable and can be moved around to suit left or right handed use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the touchscreen always-on for the double-tap-to-wake feature, Asus was able to implement a few other nifty shortcuts. For example, drawing the letter "C" on the screen while it's sleeping will wake the phone and straight up launch the camera app. "W" launches the browser and presumably stands for Web. While the letters are preset and you get six of them, you can assign any app of your choice to any letter - very convenient!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Befitting its midrange aspirations, the Asus Zenfone Selfie comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 under the hood. In this particular case the clock speed caps are set at 1.5GHz for the pseudo-big quad-core cluster of Cortex-A53's, and 1.11GHz for the other four cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review unit has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There is a lower-specced version with 2GB of RAM and half the storage. It's natural that the 2GB of RAM may adversely affect some (but not all) of the tests, so have that in mind when sifting through the numbers below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sticking to our usual drill, we kick off with the GeekBench 3.0 benchmark. The Zenfone Selfie scores a lot like you'd expect from a Snapdragon 615 device. It's on par with the similarly equipped Moto X Play and marginally ahead of the Zenfone 2 with the lesser of the Atoms, the Z3560. The Exynos 7580 in the Samsung Galaxy J7 is ahead in raw CPU power, as are the Xperias C4 and C5 Ultra.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Antutu the Zenfone Selfie posts good numbers, among the top Snapdragon 615's we've seen. It more than likely thanks to the 3GB of RAM, which can show its benefits in this compound benchmark. The more powerful CPU helps the Galaxy J7 inch ahead, despite it only has half the Selfie's RAM. The Xperias are towards the top of the crop, where you can find the top-specced Zenfone 2 with the Aton Z3580 and 4GB of RAM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall score in Basemark II 2.0 isn't impressive on its own, but it's still higher than the Moto X Play. The Zenfone Selfie is also comfortably ahead of the Galaxy J7, though it still can't match the Xperias. If you want to beat them with an Asus smartphone in this benchmark, you'd have to go with a Zenfone 2 ZE551ML, and even the Z3560/2GB model will suffice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-core performance of the Selfie is quite good, almost matching the Xperia C4 and C5 Ultra and again beating the Galaxy J7. The powerful Mediatek's in Sony's models show their strength in the multi-core results easily beating the Zenfone Selfie. The Galaxy J7 is only slightly ahead of the Selfie, and the Intel-inside Zenfone 2 isn't quite up to the same standard in the CPU parts of the benchmark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to graphics performance, the Zenfone Selfie shows some weaknesses. Never doing too well with FullHD screens the Adreno 405 posts lower numbers in GFXBench, even for its standards. A couple of fps behind the Moto X Play in the lighter T-Rex test and a few tenths of a frame in the more demanding Manhattan test aren't deal-breakers, but ruin the overall impression of a well-optimized Snapdragon 615 device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charts clearly show that either of the Zenfone 2's with their PowerVR G6430 are a much better option for intense 3D rendering. The Galaxy J7 does beat the Selfie in onscreen tests, but it's the lower 720p resolution that helps its cause.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In Basemark X the Zenfone Selfie sticks closer to its S615 brethren, comfortably ahead of the Galaxy J7, but still no match for the assorted Zenfone 2's.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JavaScript isn't the Selfie's cup of tea, scoring rather poorly in Kraken 1.1. That said, the Xperia C5 Ultra is the same ballpark and the Idol 3 (5.5) is even less inspiring and the. The Moto X Play shows that the Snapdragon 615 can do better and is well ahead, tied with the Galaxy J7. Again, the Zenfone 2's lead the pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>General web browsing performance, tested by BrowserMark 2.1, doesn't look too good either. Ahead of the Xperia C5 Ultra, the Selfie is nowhere near the Moto X Play, which is also beaten by the Galaxy J7.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it all up, the Zenfone Selfie's benchmark run is a mixed bag. Starting well in the CPU tests and going strong in compound benchmarks, it's trailing in graphics performance and scores below average numbers in browser tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook covers the basics, adds some<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie uses a combined interface for the phonebook and dialer. Out of the box it's laid out across five tabs - Telephone (dialer), Favorites, Contacts, Groups and Call Guard, for managing blocked numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can however edit the tabs and remove ones you don't use for a less cluttered interface. You can also add another tab, dubbed VIP for those among your contacts with a special status. Out of the six possible tabs you can have up to five at a time, and Telephone and Contacts cannot be removed, for rather obvious reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Side-swiping lets you switch between those without needing to reach for the top, welcome on a sizeable 5.5-inch device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can display all your available contacts, or limit the list to the ones in your Google account, either of your SIM cards or the phone's internal memory. You also get quick access to a specific letter from the alphabet as well as a search box with voice search capability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single contact gives a quick glimpse over the available means of communication with that person. Tapping on the pencil in top right corner reveals the usual myriad of options for editing with virtually every detail getting a dedicated field.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no separate call log tab, instead it's combined with the dialer, and sits underneath the num pad. That one can be easily hidden though with a tap on the icon in bottom left. The call log gives you an option to show the calls by categories or all of them together, as well as a dedicated list for the VIP calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a dual-SIM smartphone, and as such the Zenfone Selfie offers a choice of options on how to handle the two cards. Within the settings menu you can enable/disable each of the SIMs, and also assign a name for easier distinction. Obviously, you can specify which one is used for different tasks such as voice calls or data transfer. Otherwise you'll get two call buttons below the num pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie posted an Average score in our loudspeaker test. While it is an improvement over the Zenfone 2, it's still not loud enough to guarantee you won't be missing notifications in noisy environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging, email and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The generic Messaging app on the Zenfone Selfie offers straightforward texts with Asus's take on design, and works well. You can attach a picture or a video or a number of other items and that automatically turns it into an MMS message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie comes with the common set of two email apps, the generic Android Email one, albeit tastefully skinned by Asus, and Gmail. They offer largely the same functionality, with similar interface and support for multiple accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a single keyboard installed on the Zenfone Selfie, dubbed Asus Keyboard. It's not lacking in functionality and has a separate number row, which is handy, while still allowing for plenty of usable screen estate. Secondary symbols are also available, for quick punctuation or old-school emoticons without changing the entire layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes in three sizes, but Tall takes up more than half the screen and is a bit excessive. Most users will likely stick with Normal or even Short, which still provides adequate size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's swipe-enabled, although Asus calls it trace input, but the concept is the same. Flick input lets you change between upper and lower case simply by taping on the key and flicking in up for uppercase and down for lowercase - a nifty feature, saving you a tap on the dedicated button. Trace and Flick can't work together, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Capable gallery with MiniMovie and collages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie comes with a custom Gallery app. It defaults to a view of your folders and the camera roll is highlighted over the top. The Gallery also supports events and people views, plus it can display images from various cloud services including ASUS, Omlet, Facebook, OneDrive, Google Drive, Google+ and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the Asus MiniMovie app, which lets you select a bunch of images and turns them into a short video of sorts, with music, transitions and the lot, which you can customize, of course. A handy collage feature is also on board, and it's pretty comprehensive, with a host of aspect ratios, templates and backgrounds. Asus has upped the maximum resolution to 2,560 x 2,560 which is now usable for a bit more than social-media sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it, delete it, enter edit mode or just get more info. You also get quick shortcuts for rotation and additional information. The integrated editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate, fisheye, doodle) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie's video player is part of the Gallery, there isn't a dedicated app. There are no premium features or particularly striking video decoder support. Its interface is very simple, too - just a playback scrubber and a play/pause button, alongside a sharing button at the top. The most advanced feature is picking up playback from where you left off the previous time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has severely limited codec support and refuses to play most formats. WMV, DivX and MOV files don't start at all, some XviD and x264 files play fine - others don't, AC3 audio is a no-go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus music player does decently in terms of functionality, covering all the basics. The interface features the usual set of panes for artists, songs, and genres, music stored on various cloud services can be pulled as well, different color themes can be applied to the interface, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a large Now Playing window with prominent album art, and also has integrated bass boost and surround sound options, although both of those only work with headphones. An equalizer is also available with multiple presets and a single custom setting. That's in addition to the system-wide AudioWizard sound enhancement software.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A useful FM radio app is available on the Zenfone Selfie. The search function automatically stores all available stations. It has RDS and can retrieve the stations' names. You can set up to 5 favorite stations but they are displayed with their respective frequency, instead of the names.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressively clean audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie did a great job when connected to an active external amplifier. The scores it got were excellent top to bottom and it matched them with above average volume for one of the better performances across all phones, let alone mid-rangers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes very little harm - with the stereo crosstalk taking a very minor hit and the other readings remaining just as great. The loudness drops a bit too, but it's still a solid showing that would put much more expensive phones to shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich 13MP camera on the back<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie comes with a 13MP primary (or in this instance, let's just call it rear) camera shooting stills in a 4:3 native ratio up to 4,096 x 3,072 pixels (OK, technically 12.6MP). The sensor is placed behind an f/2.0 lens. It has a laser autofocus system and a dual-tone dual-LED flash to assist in low-light, but lacks optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app has the common combined interface for still and video shooting with the familiar compromise - both actions are accessible from the same screen, but you can't frame your videos before hitting record, because 4:3 coverage is rather obviously different from 16:9. Unless you're a fan of 16:9 still images, in which case you'd be fine in terms of framing, but you'd be wasting pixels in your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker can be set either as zoom control, or shutter release. The latter works great for both the rear and front cameras when held in portrait orientation, but is awkward in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu offers control over white balance, ISO, exposure compensation, the lot. The list is scrollable through still, video and general options with tabs for quick access. You also have a dedicated flash settings button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An array of shooting modes are available on top of the Auto Mode, including Night, Panorama and HDR. Depth of field takes two shots and combines them in one image for a closeup with a blurred background (bokeh). Super resolution takes multiple shots and combines them to produce a 50MP image, while Smart remove allows you delete unwanted passerbys from your photos, again based on multiple exposures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The All smiles mode takes five shots and selects the one with the highest number of smiling faces in it, and Effect applies one of a number of pre-selected filters to your shot, and is visible live in the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a comprehensive Manual mode as well, which offers you control over focus distance, shutter speed (all the way up to 32s), ISO (50-800), exposure compensation (-2/+2EV range in third-stop increments), and white balance with color temperature adjustment. An on-screen level is present, and so is a live histogram.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're actually quite happy with the output of the Zenfone Selfie's rear camera. Detail level is on a nice level for the price segment and even though the images are quite noisy, we do appreciate the laid-back approach to processing, which doesn't create a mess with overeager sharpening and noise reduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic range is rather limited, shadows often end up too dark, without having too much info preserved in the highlights either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a more positive note, colors are vivid and have a consumer-friendly vibe to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has an Optimization feature, which is on by default, but we kept it off for the above samples as we have bad experience with it on the Zenfone 2. However for the sake of comparison, we shot the samples below with the Optimization set to On. As you'll see there are no visible differences in our test scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, switching Optimization to Manual allows you to adjust some pretty advanced stuff regarding the camera's processing algorithms such as Saturation, Contrast, Sharpness, Noise reduction, Backlight, and Detail enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there's an HDR mode on the Zenfone Selfie, and if you're in Auto and the camera determines HDR is the way to go, it will suggest enabling it, but won't intervene all by itself. It does well to light up the shadows acting conservatively and doesn't produce over-the-top unnatural looking reults. Given that the images are quite noisy and burned out in the highlights to begin with, HDR doesn't sound like a bad idea as a general shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie's rear cam can get extremely close to its subject and still acquire sharp focus, resulting in some very good macro shots. With a distance of about 4cm from the front element of the lens, you'd imagine that lighting your subject would be tricky though, but that can't in any way be a fault of the Zenfone itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Panorama mode. You can shoot in both portrait and landscape orientation and the app recognizes it unlike on other brands, where you need to set it up manually (cough, Sony). The panoramas aren't the best around, but if you refrain from pixel-peeping, they'll do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shot in portrait the images are about 1,800 pixels tall, but the actual resolved detail is rather low. There are also some issues with the stitching, manifested by visible bands in the sky. Areas with texture are stitched better, provided they're far enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we shot our test posters with the Asus Zenfone Selfie and here's how it fared next to the Zenfone 2 and Samsung Galaxy J7. Of course, our tool allows you to compare it against any other smartphone that we've shot with.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good 13MP front shooter with a mighty flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The focus of the Zenfone Selfie is obviously on its front-facing cam. Another 13MP unit, it does have autofocus, though it has been stripped of the laser tech that the rear shooter has. There's a dual-tone dual-LED flash on the left side of the lens, which is a feature exclusive to the Selfie and the HTC Desire Eye - the number of front-facing flashes has been increasing recently, but most are still single-LED jobs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a comprehensive Beautification feature, for image enhancement and you can see the effects live, or apply them post-shot. The effects include skin tone adjustment, skin softening and brightening to cover imperfections and the rather peculiar eye enhancement and cheeks thinning. All of these can be set from 0 to 10, except the skin tone where you have a selection of tints to apply to your pale self.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the virtual shutter button up activates the delayed release feature ? 1 to 5 seconds depending on how far up you swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Selfie panorama mode lets you stitch multiple shots into one wide image, nicely guiding you where to keep still, so the phone can take the next shot. Unfortunately, due to the short distance to the camera, you?re more than likely to end up with stitching issues. Also resolution and detail are quite low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the smartphone named Selfie, we expected image quality on par with a good rear shooter. Apparently, front cameras aren?t quite up there with the rear cameras in terms of quality, but as front cameras go, the Selfie's is very good, just not a match for a proper primary cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of what was said about the rear camera holds true for this one as well, but the standards for front-facers are simply not as high. At least yet. And with selfie cameras pixel-level detail isn't all that important - in all likelihood these images will end up on social media, compressed and viewed to fit the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, when the megapixel card is used as a headline, we'd expect a bit more, and the Zenfone Selfie leaves us wanting. The output is again pretty noisy and dynamic range is quite compressed. But then colors are nice the phone exposes well with what it's got. The level of detail is also quite high, again, compared to regular front-facers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beautification yields interesting results, perhaps less so for us that for the phone's target audience. The second sample is shot with the feature off and for the third we had all sliders positioned midway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Skin softening wipes out most of the texture on the face, brightening kills even more detail in brightly lit areas and the eye enhancement and cheek thinning work together to create an improved version of yourself. At least that's the idea. Cranking the last two all the way up to 10 does at least have some fun value - you can go ahead a produce an almost comic book character look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash is quite powerful, so much so that it sometimes suffers from it. It would often blow out subjects (read humans), which kinda defeats its purpose. On other occasions, mostly when you?re closer to the phone than arms-length, it produces more adequately exposed images, which is a somewhat odd behavior ? you?d expect that the closer to the flash you are, the more overexposed your face would be. Overall, your mileage will vary and you may not get a perfect shot every time, but we guess it will still be appreciated in the dim places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shots below illustrate the smartphone's front camera behavior at night - first one has soft warm light seeping out through the office curtains, followed by the same scene but with the flash on, and another one with the flash in near complete darkness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent 1080p video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone Selfie shoots regular speed videos at up to 1080p resolution. There's a time lapse mode where you can select the frame interval at anywhere from 1s to 3s in half-second increments, as well as 5 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a slow motion mode, but the way Asus understands it, is now how it's supposed to be - at least we don't think that slowing down a regular video to ~6fps counts as slow motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p footage from the Zenfone selfie is captured with a bitrate of 20Mbps and audio is recorded in stereo at 96Kbps. The level of detail is miles better than the mushy Zenfone 2's output - the Selfie is still not on par with the best in business, but shows a long stride in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, little can be done about the dynamic range and with videos it's even narrower that still shots - highlights are blown, shadows are pitch black. The tendency to underexpose videos doesn't help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We struck luck with some pretty fast-changing conditions for our time lapse and it was nice to see how the Zenfone Selfie handles exposure. At a frame every five seconds, the video below was shot over the course of 80 minutes and spans the entire range from bright sunshine and a clear sky to gloomy overcast fall weather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beautiful as it may be, the sample contains even less detail than the regular footage, so you should keep in mind that it won't stand up well to pixel-level scrutiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, feel free to download an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample straight from our server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also compare the Zenfone Selfie to any of the numerous phones and tablets we've tested, but we've pre-selected the Zenfone 2 and the Samsung Galaxy J7.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A whole bunch of browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie comes with a total of three browsers pre-installed. The Asus Browser offers much the same powerful functionality as Google Chrome but differs in that it offers a navigation bar at the bottom with back/forward, tab manager, new tab and a quick shortcut to add the current page to the Do-It-Later app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's questionable whether you need a navigation bar at the bottom, when you already have a set of capacitive buttons and another bar at the top. Having access to the tab switcher from the bottom is handy, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is the more mature alternative and offers easy transition from smartphone to smartphone not to mention seamless syncing with its desktop counterpart thanks to your Google account. It's fast, clean and makes much better use of screen area. We also mentioned already that Chrome is the wiser choice if any battery longevity is to be expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Puffin browser. It's quite unlike most other browsers, has some interesting interface quirks like on screen trackpad or gamepad with a four-way controller, and it can also render flash content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie offers its own file managing app that allows you to easily take care of your video, picture, and document files, although there is no document viewer/editor pre-installed. The file manager can sift through your internal storage and memory card, but also sync with cloud storage like Google Drive, OneDrive and Dropbox. Batch operations are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom Calendar looks good, syncs with your accounts including Google, and offers Day, Week and Month views, but no Year. There's also a quick Agenda view that shows all of our events regardless of where they're recorded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus Mobile Manager aims to give you granular control over app behavior and battery and battery consumption. Auto-start manager keeps a reign on pesky apps that want to start in the backgroung without your knowledge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Power consumption can be optimized using the Power Saver app. You can select from four pre-defined modes with different settings for CPU performance, screen brightness and network use. There's also a customized mode where you can set these yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data usage section lets you set a cap on cellular traffic, as well as restrict individual apps from internet access - really handy if you want to receive your emails for example, but don't feel like ramping up traffic from social apps. To keep yourself focused, you can disable notifications too, again on an app-by-app basis. There's also a built-in antivirus app, with a shortcut inside Mobile Manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app packs a world clock feature that displays the time across various time zones, and has an integrated stopwatch and time. There's also a calculator app that has advanced functions in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a handy flashlight app with an always-on mode, three-speed strobe, and SOS pattern. Alternatively it can light up the display, but oddly not the front flash. Thanks to the laser autofocus tech, you get a precise Laser ruler, which can measure distances up to 50cm. A simple sound recorder app is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do It Later is the procrastinator's dream app for chores you want to postpone for a better time without clogging your calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A ZenLink package of four apps provides added functionality. PC Link enables you to control the smartphone from your computer, via an application you download from the Asus website. Once the application is installed and the two devices paired, a resizable mockup phone window appears on your desktop and you can use your mouse to send commands to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remote Link does just the opposite, turning your Zenfone Selfie into a remote for your PC. Another desktop app needs to be installed and communication takes place over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The Share Link apps is an additional option for quick and easy exchange of photos and what not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kids mode lets you setup a restricted number of apps for your little ones to use and also limit the range of contacts, from which calls can be received.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone Selfie key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality is solid, comes in a variety of back cover colors and finishes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display is sharp, has very accurate color rendition and plenty of tweaking options. On the other hand, it's pretty dim even at its maximum setting, and has poor sunlight legibility. Contrast is average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is decent: the Selfie does especially well in video playback, 3G call longevity is above average, but web browsing endurance is less than 8 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZenUI is a touch too colorful, but is widely customizable and has plenty of useful added features on top of Android. The OS is only v5.0.2, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmark performance shows flaws in graphics department and web browser optimization, CPU scores are solid for the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker scores an Average rating, can be quite loud with the right tune.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gallery packs plenty of features and the image editor is powerful, but you'd be needing a third-party video player straight out - the built-in one is barebones and has limited codec support. Music player doesn't have any glaring omissions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Very good audio output, above average loudness in the headphones too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>13MP rear camera produces comparatively good output for this price range with nice colors and good detail, albeit quite noisy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Front cam shoots high-res selfies with good level of detail for a front-facing unit though it's no match for the rear camera. It also boasts plenty of face-enhancement features and dual-LED front flash that does well, though our experience with it varied a lot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone Selfie isn't too quiet about what it tries to be - a smartphone for taking photos of yourself. With 13 megapixels front and back it sure has nailed the numbers game and the dual-tone dual-LED flash makes it a one-of-a-kind offering. OK, second of its kind, but still a rare breed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, name a smartphone Selfie, and you're certain to be putting a lot of weight on that front camera's shoulders. For the most part it does okay and captures decent images, as far as front cams go, but it's just not the ultimate selfie-shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Set the front-facing camera and flash aside and you essentially end up with a 5.5-inch Zenfone 2 ZE551ML, with only a few minor albeit principal differences - easily questioning the Selfie's existence, or its success at least. And even though we appreciate the user-replaceable battery in the Selfie, there's no getting around the fact that the Atom-powered Zenfone 2 (in all its incarnations, really) is a much stronger performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So again, the Zenfone Selfie's most obvious competitor comes from within Asus' ranks. The Zenfone 2 ZE55ML, be it the Z3560/2GB model or the Z3580/4GB one, does substantially better in the graphics department and from a mobile gamer's perspective the choice is a no-brainer. Those in the habit of swapping batteries will need to stick with the Selfie, and they'd be getting a few extra hours per charge to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Eye is the only other major smartphone with a dual-tone dual-LED front flash and as such can't go unmentioned. The Eye is powered by a top-tier chipset, even if a couple of generations older, so it's more powerful, in graphics tasks especially. Its display is smaller and so are overall dimension, so if you're put off by the Selfie's size, the 5.2-inch Eye might be worth a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also has IPx7 certification for water protection, slightly better battery life and fast charging, but the powerpack is sealed. Perhaps we should have started with the fact that the Desire Eye is up to twice as expensive as the Zenfone Selfie, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J7 is a more recent contender in the selfie-centric niche. It sports an AMOLED display, but its resolution is only 720p - it's not as sharp, but handles onscreen graphics with a bit more ease. Its front camera isn't as good as the one on the Selfie, not on paper and not in practice, and the same can be said about its flash. The J7 has a swappable battery too, and one that lasts longer than the Selfie's in all but voice calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No selfie shootout can do without the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra. Another 13MP unit with flash, the Xperia has a single LED on its faceplate. The C5 is the obvious choice for big-screen lovers, offering a 6-inch FullHD display in a reasonably compact package with minimal bezels. The larger diagonal takes its toll on battery life though, and the Selfie lasts longer across the board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C5 Ultra, on the other hand, consistently outperforms the Selfie, despite having a gig less RAM. Depending on where you reside, Sony's selfie-loving phablet can be between a little and a lot more expensive so that may settle it for you before you get to the matter of merits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X Play is one of the most rounded off 5.5-inch devices out now and it does so without breaking the bank. It doesn't have the Selfie's megapixel count on the front, nor the front flash, but does a pretty good job with its 5MP unit. And when it comes to the main camera on the back, the Selfie is not even in the same league. The Moto X Play's battery is a marathon runner more so than the Selfie's, and supports fast charging, but it's not user-replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, to go for the Zenfone Selfie means you must really insist on having the highest-spec'd front camera setup on a budget that the market offers. And there's nothing wrong with that - after all, Asus design this phone with a specific audience in mind. If you however don't fall in that specific group, there are not a whole lot of reasons to recommend the Zenfone Selfie over the competition.</paragraph>
