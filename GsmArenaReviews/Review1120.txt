			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It may look like Samsung is dipping a toe in unknown waters but its long-time partnership with Microsoft is a wet suit of sorts. The Ativ Tab may be the company's first Windows RT tablet but not its first Windows slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may be familiar with the Samsung Series 7, a handful of tablet PCs running the desktop version of Windows 7. These Intel-powered devices are essentially laptops proper (give or take a keyboard) and have understandably been off our radar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ativ Tab on the other hand is a tablet that we would be interested in - a tablet like them Google and Apple slates. Running the lighter Windows RT, the Ativ Tab is powered by an ARM chipset, like millions of phones and other handheld devices. All prim and proper, just not quite sure about the name. Ativ as in "Vita" read backwards. Yeah, right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it will be up to the Ativ Tab, the Microsoft Surface and probably more Windows-powered slates from the likes of Acer and Asus (why not Nokia) to bring the professed three-horse race over to tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not get carried away fantasizing about a double-edged attack on the iPad - an idea, which Samsung of all makers would most certainly savor - and take a look at the Ativ Tab's highlights instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Ativ Tab at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Specs-wise there's nothing particularly impressive about the Samsung Ativ Tab. It's less powerful than even some of the smartphones out there, we've seen better screens, more apps, voice call support, and probably superior media capabilities elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Ativ Tab has other strengths, the Office package and seamless compatibility with your home or office PC being one of the highlights. It has expandable storage too, which not all tablets guarantee. An optional keyboard and a stylus are other points in favor. Now, let's start exploring the Samsung Ativ Tab.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ativ Tab is a good-looking gadget with quality build and premium feel. It takes a lot of design cues from the Galaxy Note 10.1, but somehow manages to look way better. The minimalist design suits this tablet quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slate is entirely made of plastic, which may sound questionable considering the magnesium case of the Microsoft Surface, but there's nothing about the build and finish to raise concern. The back of the Ativ Tab is nice to touch and has a brushed aluminum look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Tab is built around a 10.1" PLS LCD display of the reasonable 1366 x 768 pixel resolution. The screen is very bright at 400-nits and boasts wide viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is above average with vivid colors and reasonably deep blacks (we're saving our usual screen tests for a retail unit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pixel density is nothing to be excited about (155ppi), but considering tablets like the Ativ Tab are viewed at a bigger distance than phones, it's not much of an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows RT platform mandates a single hardware control - the classic Windows Start button. On the Ativ Tab it is centrally placed below the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our pre-release unit, the Start button felt a little flimsy, but this will hopefully be sorted before the Ativ Tab launches. Overall, the tablet feels extra solid, no rattle and creaks even when we tried to twist it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera is located above the display, along with all the sensors. In the left corner, there's a status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two front-facing speakers on either side of the screen. We found this location to much better suit gaming and movie watching than the sides or the back of the slate. Due to the position of the speakers in the upper half of the tablet, you're not likely to cover them with your palms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Samsung Ativ Tab (in landscape) are all the buttons and ports (except the docking port). There we find the 3.5mm audio jack along with a lock/power button and the volume rocker. There's a full-size USB 2.0 port and a microHDMI port, both sharing a plastic lid. Lastly, there's a microSD card slot which is also covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The port for connecting an optional keyboard, complete with a touchpad, is located at the bottom. There's a hinge hole on each side to firmly secure the keyboard. This optional peripheral is something to consider, if you are going to do a lot of typing. Alternatively, you choose the money-saving option of a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. A mouse can be connected too via the USB 2.0 port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Tab uses a proprietary connector for charging only, which is placed at the bottom left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the Ativ Tab 10.1 we find a 5MP camera lens with an LED flash next to it. The camera is quite capable of shooting the occasional photos and HD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Tab gets its juice from a beefy 8,200mAh Li-Ion battery. Although there are no official battery life quotes yet, Microsoft promise to impress users with longevity thanks to the OS efficient resource managing. We'll be doing our own battery tests once we obtain a retail-ready unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used on the outside is the glossy variety rather than the matte finish on recent Samsung tablets. Although it's very nice to the touch, it takes fingerprints easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Operating the tablet with one hand, while holding it with the other is possible, but sooner or later you are going to feel the Ativ Tab's weight of 570 grams. Nevertheless, holding it is extremely satisfying thanks to solid build and the 8.9mm thickness. The Samsung Ativ Tab will have an optional keyboard with a touchpad. A stylus is being mentioned too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows RT in charge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In its pre-release form, the Samsung Ativ Tab runs a Consumer Preview of the Microsoft Windows RT. The latest version of Microsoft's OS boasts the familiar tile-based user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick hands-on video of the Ativ Tab UI to familiarize you with Windows 8 for tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "RT" part of the name indicates a special variety of the Windows 8 OS, designed to run on ARM-powered hardware. As a result, Windows RT could only run Metro apps, and not the typical x86 Windows desktop programs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This limitation doesn't take anything away from the great looks though. Microsoft has done an outstanding job of rethinking a rich and complex Windows 8 into a touch-friendly and easy-to-use everyday companion without compromising its capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen in Windows RT is minimalist, showing the time and date as well as battery and Wi-Fi status icons. Swiping up unlocks the slate and welcomes you with the redesigned Start menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's where the Windows Phone 7 tiled style that we love storms Windows 8. The start menu is composed of live tiles (which can be resized) acting as shortcuts to different apps and services. They can display app-specific information and use cool animations doing so. Mind you, only pinned apps are showed in the Start menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can group app tiles by dragging them onto a new group or an already existing one. A pinch will zoom out all pinned apps and show the different groups. From here, you can rename groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 8 introduces a few new gestures that enhance the user experience. A swipe from the right most edge of the screen brings up what Microsoft calls "Charms". A taskbar of sorts with icons for Search, Share, Start, Devices and Settings. If you have opened an app and bring up Charms, they will perform context-specific actions: bring up settings for the relevant app, do app-specific Search or Share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The classic Windows settings are found in the Control panel, in the Desktop mode, which we'll cover later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A left to right swipe acts like a classic ALT+Tab command and switches over to the next app you have opened. Alternatively, swiping left and going back right in a peculiar double swipe displays a thin strip listing all opened apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe from the bottom unveils a pop-up bar with a contextual menu for the current app. Think a cousin of the right mouse click. To simulate a right click (and bring the contextual menu) on a specific item on the screen (e.g. a tile on the start screen), tap and hold and nudge down. The same pop up bar appears bellow showing you different options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lastly, there's the top-to-bottom swipe. It has two functions depending on the swipe you make. On a short swipe, it reveals an app-specific contextual menu. In Internet Explorer 10 for instance, it brings a list of opened tabs. A longer swipe from the top will close an app (just like the ALT+F4 combo). Some serious Nokia N9 stuff here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We loved the split-screen feature allowing you to accommodate two apps at a time. An app can be dragged and docked to a part of the screen without completely pushing the previous one away. You cannot split the screen in half - there's always a small and a big window. It actually makes sense to have the web browser or video player in reasonable size and stuff like email, messages, stocks, etc. in the small window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plenty of neat tricks in the Windows 8 user interface, no doubt about that. Now, let's take a look at some specific apps and the Desktop mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTML Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We couldn't run our usual set of benchmarks on the Ativ Tab for obvious reasons. The browser is the single aspect of the Ativ Tab performance we were able to compare with other tablets you may know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest Internet Explorer 10, Microsoft boasts class leading HTML5 support, faster JavaScript processing and overall better web standards support. It seems that the JavaScript part is ready to deliver as the Ativ Tab aced that benchmark, but the HTML5 engine obviously still needs polishing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Sunspider score shows that the potential is there and once the browser is finalized, the Windows 8 tablets should offer pretty great browsing experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Desktop app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows RT now also comes with Desktop mode. Think of it as an app, which allows you to browse the file system of your device as well as access the Control panel, Device manager and Task manager. Unfortunately, classic x86 apps are not able to install on Windows RT.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Desktop mode things look and work almost exactly like on a Windows 7 PC sans the Start button in the bottom left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager app has been redesigned and now shows two groups of processes - active and background. There's a reading of how much RAM and processor power each app consumes, along with other useful information. You can also see a cool graph at the bottom of the window showing general usage of system resources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File explorer works as intended and the slate didn't have any difficulties connecting to external storage devices and transferring larger files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is betting big on the revamped Internet Explorer 10 in Windows 8. Here, IE10 comes in two flavors - classic and Metro. The latter is available when launched only from the Start menu and relies on gestures to get the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer 10<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The classic look of Internet Explorer 10 is accessed from within the Desktop app. It features the same design as previous versions and supports everything from tabs to bookmarks. You can even play around with the settings on a more advanced level, including cookies, allowed and blocked websites, cache management and more. There's no Flash of course.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office 2013<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another trick up Windows RT's sleeve is the Office 2013 Home &amp; Student edition. It includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To optimize the experience on Windows RT, Microsoft has removed some features from the Office 2013 RT. For example, you cannot add third-party add-ins or use macros. Support for Visual Basic Applications is also disabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every app of the Office 2013 RT suite offers a lot of templates to start a project. Whether you want to create an annual report in Excel, complex PowerPoint presentation for a meeting or just write a simple school report in Word, you've got a wide choice of templates to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Office 2013 RT has an option to optimize the user interface for touch input. It's enabled via a dedicated button with a blue icon. Upon pressing it, buttons get more padding around them. It's a minor change that marginally improves the user experience on slates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, Windows 8 tablets look quite an attractive option - as bold a statement this may be on a market pretty much owned by Apple and swarmed by Android. Price permitting, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is impressive with cool gestures and neat little tricks, it's consistent, friendly and good-looking. The Ativ Tab we tested hasn't got the most powerful hardware but that didn't take away from what we found to be a compelling experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, no the Ativ Tab is obviously not in the same league as the New iPad and the Galaxy Note 10.1 but hopefully that will be reflected in the price tag. There's the issue with apps as well. Microsoft's app market is hopelessly behind Apple's and Google's but Redmond finally has the consistent cross-device ecosystem that will be increasingly hard for developers to overlook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having caught a glimpse of an early test unit, We're yet to see if the Samsung Ativ Tab's bite will be as good as its bark. But it's been a pleasure and we're looking forward to our next encounter with Windows RT on handheld - we won't say no to smartphones or Pro tablets either.</paragraph>
