			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 is not just a phone, it's a corporate rejuvenation. A9 is the boost HTC needs to swim out of the murky waters and claim its piece on the market. HTC may have outed a few very capable phones this year, but it needs a game changer, a statement that the king is still alive and kicking. But will the One A9 turn out to be everything HTC hopes it to be, or quite the opposite - a Pandora's Box of sorts?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 may seems like a departure from other One phones, but in fact - it's an evolution of the One M7. HTC flattened the metal unibody, thinned the profile and added a 2.5D front glass with curved edges following the recent trends. And there is the vivid AMOLED screen, the OIS camera and the microSD expansion slot - we won't object to any of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the signature stereo speaker setup at the front - they were a major selling point of previous One smartphones. But keeping those speakers in the One A9 would have increased the AMOLED's bezels, which would have impacted the overall positive impression of a compact and beautiful phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 seems like a proper mid-ranger, well equipped and thoughtfully targeted. The pricing in the USA has been more than attractive, but we have yet to see how the higher EU price will impact the sales. Hopefully carrier contracts and retailer deals would help it in the long run as at its current commitment-free price its odds don't look so good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have some mixed feelings about why HTC has put so much effort into a midrange phone and the only logical answer seems to be that the One A9 is merely paving the way for the company's big return in the flagship segment. But until we wait to see how things will turn out - let's put the One A9 through its paces. Maybe it will be the market share booster after all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One A9 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the HTC One A9 spreads at 145.8 x 70.8 x 7.3 mm, which is about 1mm thicker and wider than the HTC One M9 flagship. The One M9 is also built around a 5" display, but offers stereo speakers at the front, while the A9 replaces them with just a fingerprint scanner. Luckily the more compact AMOLED screen and the smaller battery have allowed for a thinner profile at 7.3mm and a lighter body at 143g of total weight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One M7 wasn't the first all metal device of the Taiwanese company, but it did popularize the antenna strips over the back. The HTC One M8 had the same strips, the One M9 used them, too. And the One A9 also relies on similar plastic strips to cover the antenna pieces over the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the HTC history, the One A9 is indeed an evolution of the One series - it's basically a thinner and flatter HTC One Mx (you pick a number). But putting the trending 2.5D curved edge front cover glass, made it look more or less like an iPhone 6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 looks like an iPhone 6. But it also looks like an HTC One M8. The truth is there is very little space for design innovation today and inevitably the devices are becoming closer and closer together. Right now if you want to make a sleek and thin smartphone, you put a 2.5D glass screen. A rounded edges makes it look even thinner and improve the aesthetics. In the end, the phone may turn up looking like an HTC, or a Sony, or a Samsung. Or an iPhone. True, the HTC have overdone it. They could have made some changes to the design for the sake of it being different. Instead, they chose not to, and we'll be following closely what that would mean for their sales. We have a feeling conservative European users are not looking for an iPhone clone but who knows!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC One A9 evolved from its previous One M siblings by flattening the metal unibody and putting a Gorilla Glass 4 protective glass with curved edges. Both of those features ensure modern and sleek design and premium exterior. We do appreciate HTC's desire to keep the iconic metal shells for the One series and we are quite fond of the One A9 handling experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 doesn't impress with the screen bezels, but the black glass helps thinning the overall impact of the top and bottom huge strips. While there are no front stereo speakers, the One A9 replaces those with a fingerprint scanner / Home key at the bottom and a nicely nested earpiece on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP OIS rear camera at the back is bulging, but that was inevitable - a thin shell and a capable camera often result in a camera hump. It was that or a thicker and heavier body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the One A9 is a real pleasure - the aluminum unibody feels great in hand, while the curved edges and display don't compromise the handling as others do. The One A9 offers secure grip due to small thoughtful departures of the traditional rounded edges and the grippy matte finish on the all metal back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to the HTC One A9's control set. The earpiece, the front 4MP UltraPixel selfie snapper, a hidden tiny notification LED and a few invisible sensors are all on top of the 5" AMOLED screen. Below is the lonely capacitive Home key, which also doubles as an always-on fingerprint reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint scanner is really fast and unlocks your phone even when the display is turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ejectable microSD and nanoSIM trays are on the left, while the right side of the One A9 has the volume rocker and the nicely textured Power/Lock key, which reminds us of the OnePlus Two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top has nothing but a piece of matte plastic, which we guess covers another antenna as there is no IrDA port on this device. The bottom of the One A9 houses the microUSB 2.0 port flanked by the loudspeaker grille and the audio jack. The primary mic is also around the connectivity port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens and the dual-LED dual-tone flash are on the back, as is the secondary microphone used for noise-cancelling and stereo audio recording during video capturing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 packs a 5-inch AMOLED display, which is a great treat for a mid-ranger. It's a high-quality panel of 1080p resolution, which delivers 441ppi of pixel density. While not record-breaking numbers, individual pixels are nonetheless indistinguishable to the naked eye and so is the diamond PenTile matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 packs a punch with its display as it's got impressive contrast levels courtesy of the AMOLED panel. Unfortunately, the maximum screen brightness is less than stellar at 366nits, which is about average for the midrange class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are offered two color modes - the AMOLED one, which provides slightly oversaturated but eye-pleasing colors and the sRGB mode, which is amazingly color accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 surprised us in the sunlight legibility test, where it scored higher than the Galaxy Note5 and placed itself third below the Nokia PureView 808 champ.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 is powered by a 2,150 mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery, which looks about right for a 5" device. We've seen Samsung AMOLED's produce great battery endurances, but we've also seen quite poor non-Samsung phones with AMOLED. So, we were very eager to put the One A9 through its paces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the news isn't good. The AMOLED screen or maybe the Snapdragon 617 chip, turned out to be the Achilles's heel of the One A9. The phone did very poorly when it comes to web browsing, while it outed average scores on 3G calls, video playback and 3G standby. Thus the final endurance rating of 46 hours is below the average mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 46 hour rating means you can count on two days, barely, if you do an hour each of calling, browsing and video playback a day. Such usage pattern is of course entirely artificial, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 supports Quick Charge 2.0 and the upcoming Quick Charge 3.0 standard, and can replenish the battery blazing fast once hooked on a proper fast charger (9V). Unfortunately, HTC isn't providing one in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9, thanks to the Snapdragon 617 chip, supports lots of LTE bands and covers the specs for LTE Cat. 7 (up to 300Mbps downlink, up to 100Mbps uplink). It also offers quad-band GSM connectivity and quad or penta-band (market dependent) 3G connectivity with HSPA support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the wireless connectivity features include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support and Wi-Fi Direct. Android Marshmallow now allows you to setup your phone's hotspot on the far less crowded 5GHz band on compatible devices and this options is available in the HTC One A9's Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and GLONASS, plus an FM radio. Wireless screen mirroring is available via the Miracast protocol. NFC is also available, but works only for contactless payments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Connect feature works over the DLNA protocol to provide smoother integration of your phone to your home-entertainment setup, for supported devices of course. Those include multi-room speakers adhering to the Qualcomm AllPlay standard; DLNA and Miracast-compatible devices, Bluetooth speakers, as well as HTC-certified devices carrying the HTC Connect logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An MHL-enabled micro-USB 2.0 port sits on the bottom of the phone and lets you stream video to compatible TVs via an appropriate MHL HDMI dongle. USB host is enabled, for connecting external storage. A standard 3.5mm headphone jack lets you plug in your headphones of choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 accepts nano-SIM cards. The microSD slot lets you extend the 16GB of built-in storage to up to 200GB. Thanks to Android Marshmallow, users can now add an SD card, which will then be adopted by the system to behave like internal storage. The memory card will be formatted and encrypted and will be seen like internal memory. You can then install apps and other private data easily onto the memory card.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 is the first device we meet running on the newly released Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Naturally, the A9 comes skinned with the company's proprietary Sense 7.0 UI layer on top, and we're already familiar with this latest iteration from the One M9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen hasn't changed much since Sense 6 - it features a clock with weather info plus four shortcut slots. Missed calls and incoming messages are duly displayed, too, of course. You can limit the notifications' displayed information or disable them entirely if you have privacy concerns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy to report the always-on fingerprint sensor is very accurate and unlocks the display immediately even when it's turned off. The Home key, which houses the sensor, is capacitive though and we needed some time to get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 supports both swipe up and double tap to unlock, meaning you won't have to rely on the power/lock key all the time. You should use the gestures with care though, as you may end up accidentally unlocking your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the HTC One A9 is once again reserved for HTC Blinkfeed. It aggregates content from your social networks (Flickr, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Twitter, Zoe), as well as from over a thousand news sources. You can pick the topics you're interested in and Blinkfeed will automatically pull relevant content. You can also search for specific content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blinkfeed service, with the help of the new Sense Home feature will now suggest nearby places to eat. Blinkfeed becomes aware of your eating habits and will eventually begin popping up restaurant suggestions on your lockscreen shortly before your lunch break or after you leave work. And if some of your friends have left reviews for those places, those will be shown as well, thanks to the Yelp and Foursquare integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreens are fully customizable with links and widgets. If you don't find Blinkfeed particularly useful and don't want it lingering on the front you can do away with it just like any other widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense Home widget, which debuted on the M9 is present here as well. It looks quite ordinary with eight shortcuts - six of them are app shortcuts, while the last two are folders for recent documents and recommended apps you may want to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't configure the shortcuts, Home Sense chooses them for you, but you can opt to remove the smart folder. After you input your home and work addresses, the widget changes the visible shortcuts depending on your current location - work, home or outside. It learns what you are using the most and puts those apps up front. The Home Sense locations are also used by the Blinkfeed for mealtime suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wallpapers, lockscreen style, ringtones, notification sounds and alarms can be customized via a dedicated menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are also supported, and they change your lockscreen and homescreen wallpapers, the app drawer background, the default messaging app wallpaper, the system color scheme, the icon package for apps and settings, all ringtones and the system font.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a dedicated Themes Store for downloading themes, but you can also get fonts, pictures and ringtones separately and apply them to your current theme. You can even build your own themes very easily and if you think they are really good, you can upload them to the store for others to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One finger swipe from the top of the homescreen will open the notification area, which features a cleaner look in Android 5.0 Lollipop. An additional swipe reveals the quick toggles area that include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane mode, screen auto-rotate, flashlight, location on/off, and the option to cast the screen. A double-finger swipe goes straight to the toggles, which are configurable, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default layout of the app drawer is a 4 x 5 grid of app icons. A 3 x 4 mode is also available, though a 5 x 6 would have made far more sense. You can sort app icons alphabetically, chronologically or manually and you can hide the ones you don't need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher has a neat card interface that allows you to select the app you need by swiping up or down. The Chrome tabs now can appear as a cards, too. There is an option to close all opened/suspended apps at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen pinning allows to have an app displayed at all times until you unpin it with a simultaneous press and hold on the Back and Task switcher buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap and hold on the Home button brings the new Now on tap UI with a new animation, courtesy of Android Marshmallow. This new interface recognizes what's on your screen and offers suggestion results based on the automatic search it's done in the meantime. For example - if you are inside the HTC One A9 review, the Now on Tap will detect the HTC One A9 as a keyword and will search for it on the web (don't you go anywhere else yet). While the feature seems useful it doesn't really look more than an automatic Google search and it's nowhere near the Google Now AI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android Marshmallow also offers the Do Not Disturb as a quick setting - it's right below the Wi-Fi quick toggle. It is essentially the previous Interruptions feature. You can choose between Total silence mode, Alarms only mode, or Priority only mode. You can customize these options from the notifications drop down or the Settings app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lot of people were upset by the lack of a traditional Silent mode in Lollipop. With M, the silent mode is back, accessed by holding down the volume button and then once again to exit the vibrate mode. Only scheduled alarms would sound off in Silent mode, pretty much as they're expected to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, new permission management system is available. Each app that requires special permission will be installed without warning, instead you will be asked to allow or deny access upon the first launch. This way you can install and update apps easily, and you will never miss a suspicious permission request as Marshmallow will ask you at every first launch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 is the first smartphone to utilize the Snapdragon 617 SoC, which upgrades the mid-range Snapdragon 615 with the ability to use all 8 Cortex-A53 CPU cores at once and bumps the RAM frequency. The connectivity suite got faster Wi-Fi, support for LTE Cat.7, Bluetooth 4.1 and Quick Charge 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 is not a flagship device, so we didn't expect flagship results. By choosing a mid-tier chipset HTC made a clear statement the A9 won't be fighting the top of the shelf devices, but rather the upper midranges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 puts to the test the multi-core performance of the octa-core processor of the One A9. It's a quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 &amp; quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 actually, but unlike the Snapdragon 615 chips, the S617 can use all of those cores simultaneously. The final result is a noticeable performance increase over the S615 devices (Oppo R1x and R7, vivo X5Pro), while the A9 is also very close to the hexa-core CPU of the Snapdragon 808 (LG G4, Xiaomi Mi 4c) and the Helio X10 chip performance (Xperia M5).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 5 gauges CPU, GPU and memory performance and the HTC One A9 outs mid-range scores, as expected. It does the same as the Snapdragon 801-packing Xperia Z3 Compact and the Helio X10-powered Xperia M5. The S808 and S810 chips are obviously better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another well-known compound test is the BaseMark OS II 2.0 app, which takes into consideration the CPU, GPU and RAM, but also the web and OS performances. The HTC One A9 once again came in the middle of the chart, outing similar results as the Helio X10 fellas.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its single-core performance is quite mediocre, but so are all Cortex-A53 cores out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, the true-octa core power shines at the multi-core test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, about the graphic capabilities. The Adreno 405 GPU has never been known of its superb performance - it was designed to serve the mid-class after all. The one in the HTC One A9 does not support Quad HD resolutions, so video playback and capturing are out of the question. And while the Adreno 405 will do awesome on 720p screens, the one in the HTC One A9 is a 1080p one, which should somewhat lower the performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, both the offscreen and onscreen tests reveal the One A9 is a mediocre achiever at best, putting it next to its S615 siblings (Oppo R7, R1x, vivo X5 Pro, Nubia Z9 mini). This isn't bad, but it means you should not expect smooth performance of heavy 3D games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest GFX 3.1 tests and the BaseMark ES3.1 bench based on the OpenGL ES 3.1 reveal the same findings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BaseMark X GPU test also puts the HTC One A9 behind the Xperia M5 and Meizu MX5, which are running on MediaTek's Helio X10 (with PowerVR G6200 GPU).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A mid-ranger usually does average on the web benchmarks and so is the HTC One A9. The Chrome's JavaScript performance (the Kraken test) and the overall web performance (the Browsermark 2.1) are about the average.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless of whether you opt for the HTC One A9 with 2 or 3 GB of RAM, you'll get a mid-range smartphone to the bone. Its processing power is indeed very impressive, but its GPU is an average performer and may struggle in future top-tier 3D games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app groups the call log, dialer, favorites, contacts, and groups in tabs, which can be reordered or removed. A dropdown allows you to filter contacts by source - stored in the phone, coming from an online phonebook or a social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual contact info is displayed in tabs too, a Sense tradition. The first tab shows basic contact info like phone numbers, emails, work info plus individual options for ringtones, blocking the contact and adding them to Private contacts. Private contacts is a discrete option that hides the name and photo of a contact when there's an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab, Thread lists all communication history between you and the given contact - texts, emails and calls. The third and final tab displays the contact's social networking updates for easy access. Tabs here can be reordered and hidden, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC One A9 displays the last call with a contact photo so you can easily redial someone. There's smart dialing that looks for both names and contacts. You can even switch to a regular QWERTY keyboard though you have to do this each time you open the dialer and we still find that the dial pad is quicker, it was invented for a reason after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can block contacts or add them to the exception list of the Do Not Disturb mode (Interruptions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 lacks stereo speakers at front, instead it relies on a single speaker placed at the bottom. It failed to impress, scoring a Below Average mark, just a notch below our Average achievement. What that means is you should keep an eye on the One A9 if you don't want to miss an important call or notification.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 uses the traditional threaded view for SMS and MMS messages, and they are composed from within the same interface. There's built-in functionality to block messages from certain numbers, those go in the Block box where you can view them later if you like or set the app to discard them immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The look of the app can be tweaked with color schemes and custom backgrounds, font size and how many lines are used for preview in threaded view. The Messages app can also backup and restore messages, so you don't need a third-party app for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 comes with two email apps - a skinned version of the stock email app and the dedicated Gmail app. The native one has a combined inbox and supports options for peak and off-peak syncing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard offers big, comfortable keys and you can run a calibration tool if you think the default setup slips up. A Swype-like Trace option is available and you can enable bilingual prediction (vital with so many English terms entering every day speech in most languages).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other customization options include switching between layouts (e.g. QWERTY, AZERTY), adding arrow keys (for the portrait keyboard only) and a personal dictionary of words that can be backed up to the microSD card or an email.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sense's Gallery with Highlights<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app uses an Android style navigation drawer to separate viewing modes. Timeline groups photos by date, while Albums work like folders. You can manually create albums, the app will ask you to select a number of photos and videos to either copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice little addition to the gallery is the custom search function. Interestingly enough it not only goes through photo meta data, but can also do a sort of reverse image search and find similar photos to a preselected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All albums get a Highlight video as their title image. You can select which items go into the video, in what order and with what effects and music. There are options to go back to the default chronological order, music and theme so don't be afraid to experiment. The start and end clips can be selected manually if you want to create a sort of title card and credits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manually create Highlight videos via the Zoe Video Editor app and export them into 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery's editing options range from basic crop/rotate/flip to frames and advanced effects like simulated lighting, adjusting face contour and eye enhancements. There are even RAW enhancements for the RAW DNG images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also choose an image from the gallery and use it as a base for a custom theme. The theme generator automatically suggests a highlight color, among other things, and you can complete your custom theme in just a few seconds. Of course, you can edit it later through the Themes app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a special Media gesture useful here and in the music and video players - swipe up with three fingers to "throw" the content you're viewing to a DLNA device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player on the HTC One A9, you browse videos through the Gallery or the File Manager. The video players supports the most common containers - AVI, MKV and MP4 - while the video codec support is spotty - XviD and H.264, while DivX and WMV are no-go. There is no support for AC3 audio either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There seems to be some kind of an issue with files with high video bitrate - some of them can't be played, while others can't sustain a pleasant framerate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the interface, you get basic playback controls and the option to snap a screenshot. Subtitles are not supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oddly, the music player in charge of your collection on the HTC One A9 is the Play Music app. Don't get this wrong, we love the app because of the Google Play Music streaming service, we were just surprised not find the HTC Sense music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Play Music offers more than enough sorting options for your local collection, while the Play Music service supports playlists and offline downloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone supports 24-bit, 192KHz lossless high-resolution audio and also offers BoomSound with Dolby Audio Surround sound experience for headphones, and although the two technologies are not connected, to experience either of them you would need compatible headphones and in the case of the Hi-Res audio, some pretty good hearing as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 also packs an FM radio too with RDS support. It can play through the speakers but you still need a pair of headphones to serve as an antenna.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nicely clear, very loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Audio output quality has traditionally been HTC's forte and the One A9 is not an exception. The smartphone delivers flawlessly clean output both with an active external amplifier and garnishes that with excellently high volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones and you get a moderate amount of stereo crosstalk and a bit of intermodulation distortion, but neither of those is particularly bad and the output remains solid. Loudness remains high too, rounding up another great performance by an HTC handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems HTC have done a great job with the built-in audio hardware and you can really tell the presence of a dedicated headphone amp makes a difference in volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9's main camera is a brand new unit. It has a 13MP BSI sensor (4:3) behind an f/2.0 lens and it's armed with optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dual-tone, dual-LED flash will help out for night shots, while a sapphire cover keeps the lens from getting detrimental scratches. Good thing too since the camera protrudes slightly from the back (about as much as on the iPhone 6s).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie camera uses HTC's UltraPixel sensor (4MP, 16:9), which also employs an f/2.0 lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC streamlined the camera UI, but it remains familiar to One users. Auto mode is for quick and simple shooting, while Pro mode lets you tweak shutter speed (up to 2s), ISO and other settings to get the perfect shot. For ultimate tweaking you can switch to RAW files that you can edit later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 comes with an automatic RAW Enhancement option that takes several seconds to process the file and bring out the best quality. It doesn't allow manual tuning of the parameters though, you can use third-party software if you want total control over the processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The captured photos came out with very good amount of resolved detail, accurate colors and spot-on white balance. Foliage is resolved very well, something lots of devices are failing to do recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is lots of noise though, but we guess the untouched noise is the reason of the high amount of detail. The noise in the shadows is hurting the pictures though as it makes the images look softer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR option, if turned on, brings back detail in the shadows, while keeping the highlights almost intact. The One A9 offers high dynamic range, but there are occasion where the HDR option would definitely help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the optical image stabilization allows for shutter speeds as low as 1/5s in low light. Most of the images shot at night may turned quite well thanks to these lower shutter speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you really want light trails in your shots, you can choose an even longer shutter speed (up to 2s) from the manual Pro mode, but you'll have to use a tripod for those. Both samples came rather soft, but are still OK for sharing on social networks and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama resolution is the same as on the HTC One M9 - the A9 it shoots at 1850px in portrait mode and up to 1080px if you are using landscape view. The images are OK, stitching is very good, but the resolved detail is far from great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we took a sample with the front 4MP UltraPixel camera. It isn't shining with detail, but it's super wide and will do for great group selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 turned out quite capable 13MP sharpshooter. You can put it next to other competitors in our picture comparison tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both cameras top out at 1080p @ 30fps video recording though, a limitation of the Snapdragon 617 chipset. There's no 60fps mode either for those action-packed scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A9 seems more focused on still photography than video excellence, aside from one thing - the Hyperlapse mode. We've seen several implementations of the hyperlapse concept (by Instagram, Microsoft and others), but if you're unfamiliar, hyperlapses are basically heavily stabilized time lapse videos shot by hand. They look impressive, and the best app we've seen so far - called Hyperlapse - is only available on iOS, so kudos to HTC for bringing that functionality straight inside the A9 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the One A9 has OIS, but Hyperlapse makes it look like the camera is sliding on rails, giving the video a cinematic feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can speed up time by up to 12x and then use Zoe to stitch several videos together, add some music and you're ready to share your vacation videos with friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Hyperlapse videos come out in 720p resolution and the detail is rather low. Still, the Hyperlapse effect is good and the videos will serve their purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Hyperlapse video we've taken with the HTC One A9 at 6x speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular 1080p videos are shot at steady 30 fps and saved in MP4 containers. The videos use H.264 video codec (video bitrate is about 20Mbps), while the AAC audio is stereo with 192Kbps bitrate at 48 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail is unsatisfactory though, the videos are very soft and the dynamic range is low. They have far less noise than the still images though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download the  1080p video sample from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 is also available in our Video Compare Tool and you can put it head to head with other 1080p shooters.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Chrome browses the web<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 comes with Google Chrome only, which can sync the tabs you have open on other devices (desktops, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data across different platforms.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 comes with the entire Google Package pre-installed - Docs, Sheets, Slides, Photos, Drive, Play Music, Maps, Hangouts, Gmail and Chrome. So your documents needs and online storage, plus navigation and messages are dully covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has skinned its calendar to match Sense 7 looks. Adding an event lets you specify time (with a warning if there's a conflict with another event), who will attend and where the meeting will be held. Multiple online calendars are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Backup can do manual or scheduled backups of your apps, messages (texts and emails), contacts and accounts (mail and social). The data is sent either to Google Drive or Dropbox and you can limit the app to transfer over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice recorder, alarm clock, weather app, calculator and flashlight apps are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can buy an optional DotView case for the One A9 and the phone comes with an app preinstalled. It offers you a choice of numerous themes as well as additional personalization. You can even play Dot-enabled games here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the News Republic app, which is a news aggregator with beautiful interface, similar to Flipboard. You choose your interests and sources and it begins choosing news for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One A9 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality is excellent, as is the design, though the evolution of the design language has brought it dangerously close to the iPhone 6 and 6s;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED display is excellent, too: it offers class-leading contrast, vivid colors and wide viewing angles though only average maximum brightness. The sunlight legibility is great as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is barely average at 46h rating, let down by poor web browsing score and mediocre call, video and standby endurances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comes with rich wireless and wired connectivity options, but we miss the IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense 7 is a deeply customized UI for the latest Android Marshmallow, but all the latest Android features such as Android Pay, the Now on Tap and post-installation app permissions are all there plus a lot more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mid-range Snapdragon 617 chipset offers fast processing, but poor graphic performance on the 1080p display. The 2GB of RAM on our review unit are quite sufficient it seems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player codec support is a mixed bag, DivX videos and AC3 audio are no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio output quality is class-leading, being nicely clear and very loud just as advertised;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera photos offer high level of detail, good dynamic range, great contrast, lively colors and accurate white balance. The noise levels are quite high though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p video samples came out soft with average detail and low dynamic range, the Hyperlapse videos are somewhat low in resolution.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 is supposedly the one smartphone to turn around HTC's low sales and redeem past mistakes. And it's a mid-ranger everybody should be delighted to have - the One A9 comes in a beautiful, sleek metal unibody, with a great 5" AMOLED screen, a capable enough Snapdragon 617 chip and there is even an optically stabilized 13MP camera on the back. It deals away with the stereo speakers though, which might be considered as betrayal among the most loyal HTC fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That however is not the thing that's bothering us. Our only concern with the One A9 isn't the controversial design, which may or may not be taking after the iPhone 6, but the pricing. While the USA can have the One A9 with 32GB storage and 3GB RAM for $400, the European prices begin around the ?600 mark for the 16GB storage and 2GB RAM. And that's not a price for a mid-ranger, be it a premium one, not by a longshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But wait, there is more. HTC is giving the USA fans even more special treatment by offering a a full year HTC UhOh protection for free, and half a year's worth of free Play Music subscription. How about that?!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you get the US exclusive special *unlocked* edition, you'd also benefit from a bootloader unlock option without hurting the warranty plus HTC has committed to delivering timely Android upgrades to this version - and that's within 15 days of the moment the Nexus lineup gets it. It sounds quite a lot like those Google Play Editions of flagship phones that Google used to sell through its own online store. It's surely a step in the right direction, but unfortunately, it seems this edition will not be available in Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if HTC One A9 has any chance to improve HTC's sales, fix past mistakes and account for a market share rise, the aggressive pricing on the US market is what we should be seeing in Europe too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anywhere you put it, the HTC One A9 will be a tough sell on the Old Continent at this price level. The situation in the US is noticeably better but still not enough to make the phone universally appealing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Europe the HTC One M9 costs at least ?150 below the One A9 and offers a more powerful chipset, stereo speakers, a better main camera with 4K video recording and better battery life. It is thicker and heavier, but the Snapdragon 810 is a real beast under a 1080p display, while the signature dual-speaker setup at the front is something many HTC fans are craving for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 costs almost half the One A9 in Europe and yet it also succeeds in making a sleek design out of metal. The 5.2" 1080p IPS display is quite good, and so is the Kirin 930/935 chipset. The P8 matches the main camera of the One A9, and offers a bigger battery and better battery life. And while it may run on Lollipop today, the Marshmallow upgrade is reportedly, already under the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the shelf LG G4 is also priced about ?150 below the One A9 and while it may lack the aesthetics of the One A9, it offers a bigger and higher resolution display, more powerful hardware and much more capable camera. The G4 got its price slashed twice in the past months though, and we hope the One A9 follow suit soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the AMOLED experience is what you are after, you can always refer to the powerful 5.1" Galaxy S6 (?480) or the metal 5.5" Meizu MX5 (?400). Both phones deliver great performance and camera experience, and both are built of premium materials - glass and metal. The thin metal Oppo R7 also relies on a 5" AMOLED screen, but has inferior performance compared to those flagships. Its camera package is similar to One A9's and it costs about half its price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 'flagship killer' OnePlus 2 is also cheaper than the One A9, and while it can't match the metal unibody and premium AMOLED screen, it will give you the power of the Snapdragon 810 chipset, 3 or even 4GB of RAM and 4K videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the recently reviewed Xiaomi Mi 4c turned out surprisingly good with flagship-grade performance thanks to the Snapdragon 808 chip. Its 13MP camera may not be OIS enhanced, but it did blow the competition out of the water in terms of pure photo quality. The Mi 4c brings USB Type-C port and comes with dual-SIM capabilities, while its MIUI 7 is very pleasant to work on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One A9 is a great mid-range device and it manages to deliver a hassle-free user experience in all departments. Unfortunately, it costs as much as a flagship and HTC didn't even bother to include something as basic as a fast-charging plug in the retail package. This won't go well with the conservative European audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless where you live, opting for the One A9 at launch isn't probably the best deal you can get. We'd hope that after the holiday season the One A9's price will be substantially adjusted to a more reasonable level, but we sure hope they don't miss jumping on the holiday shopping wave while waiting to cash in on the current inflated pricing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Knowing how to make a premium smartphone properly is not enough to profit big and this is a lesson HTC should have already learnt with the One M9. Don't get us wrong. The One A9 is an enjoyable device to hold and use. We sure hope HTC has a true flagship somewhere in their labs made of the same magic stuff like the One A9. But to turn bad times around, sometimes merely having a nice product is not enough. You also need to have it out in the right moment and you need to price it right. These are two things that have so far eluded the company and for the sake of all HTC fans out there, we sure hope they will finally get it all right.</paragraph>
