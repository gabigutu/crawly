			<paragraph>One of a kind is the last thing to call Sony Ericsson G705 upon as much as a glimpse. But conceited scoffs may be bitterly regretted. Wi-Fi, GPS and lightning fast data are likely to turn the snooty sneer into an embarrassed smirk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, one of a kind may be not precisely right but the G705 is pretty darn close. The handset is only the second feature phone in the Sony Ericsson Generation Web lineup. To narrow it down even further, the G705 is only the company's second feature phone to sport both WLAN and GPS. And since the other one is proudly perched at the top of the Cybershot tree, the G705 has the midrange all to itself. What a cheeky chap!.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature phone with no gaps in the spec sheet, Sony Ericsson G705 finds itself in quite a predicament. One, it's good enough to mess with the big boys (yep, that's smartphones), but second, it's cocky enough for the big boys to start messing with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point, the G705 has virtually no competition among non-OS phones. Check out our comparative table below for the kind of smartphone track the G705 will be running on. A couple of Symbian-powered Nokia devices are there for a taster of what our Sony Ericsson handset is up against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've got a bunch of sliders there, with Wi-Fi, GPS and FM radio not even mentioned in the table, as all of them are available across the sample. Nokia E66 and Nokia N95 are all-in-one Symbian phones that, business or multimedia spin aside, easily match the main point of G705 - web browsing and connectivity. The now elderly Nokia N95 manages to even match its price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6260 slide is bigger and heavier but that's probably quite worth it, given the higher-res screen, better camera, stereo speakers and the great web browser borrowed from S60 UI. But it would be a few months before it hits the market while Sony Ericsson G705 will be enjoying a good headstart - and sets to make the best of the Christmas shopping spree. What's more, the G705 sounds notably easier on the wallet than the yet-to-be-released Nokia 6260 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks like we're all set to fire up the G705, so hit the jump to see it spin and swing into action.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson G705 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 measures 95 x 47 x 14.3 mm and weighs 98 grams. The neat phone is quite compact and relatively slim, though maybe of a little too basic styling for the feature load it carries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 is entirely made of plastic. And no, that's not a criticism. That it looks just like any other Sony Ericsson slider will probably pass too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The point is it looks a rather low-end Sony Ericsson slider. It's just that the exterior does the excellent feature set no justice at all. Especially in the Silky Gold variety we got for our test. It does feel like "Hey, we've got a nonsense of a phone, let's paint it gold so it gets noticed." Not fair at all to a handset that does deserve enough credit for redefining midrange feature sets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel, which is entirely made of glossy black plastic, could've done just great without the golden accents. The repeating circle pattern of the OK, Call and End keys would've been a nice touch to a conservative styling dominated by straight solid lines, was it not for the offensive color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slide-out flatbed keypad follows suit to make us absolutely certain the Majestic Black version of the handset is the way to go. The brushed gold-painted rear and sides of our G705 unit are enclosed in a silver frame (eyebrows duly raised) and topped with a glossy black slider, so it almost feels like they put together bits form two different handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only good thing about the gold bits is the brushed plastic is utterly immune to fingerprints, as opposed to the glossy front, which is quite susceptible to smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2.4" QVGA display dominates the front panel. Above it, an ambient light sensor, earpiece and video-call camera share the topmost section of the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4" 256K-color TFT screen has nothing to do with the mineral-glass-covered display of C905 and its superb contrast and vivid colors. Sunlight legibility is passable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, a round D-pad is flanked by two blocks of controls of a symmetric semicircle pattern. The one on the left features a soft key and the Activity menu key, a round Call knob squeezed in. On the right there's a soft key, Clear key and the round End button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three golden knobs - OK, Call and End key - only make sense with the slider up and the gold-painted keypad revealed. Otherwise they are a cheesy accent on the low key black front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call and End knobs are too sunk in for a comfortable press. On a different note, the two soft keys, along with the Clear and Activity Menu key, are quite user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>D-pad size is OK, and tactility quite commendable, never mind the low stroke. The confirm key though is totally flush with the surrounding surface and thus way less comfortable than it size suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone up reveals the flatbed alphanumeric keyboard with subtle ridges between rows and fine clefts between columns for great touch orientation. Tactility is further improved by the slightly bulging keys, resulting in tangible terracing. The top row of keys isn't affected a jot by the slider form factor and enjoys plenty of head room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft white keypad backlighting is relatively even. The rightmost column of keys only has a warmer tint - an inevitable spillover from the alternative purple backlighting in web-browser mode. The keys are shortcuts for the web related search, bookmarks, home and zoom features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in standby, the keypad locks automatically upon sliding the phone closed, and that's non-negotiable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson G705 features nothing but the regular Fast Port. The M2 memory card slot in G705 is hidden under the battery cover, an etched M2 logo marking its location. We wish the Fast port was sealed - would've looked way better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker and shutter key are the controls on the right side of the phone. Both are slim and quite rigid, tactility quite poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the G705 features a novelty - a tiny play-stop key that will launch the music player from any point in the interface, except the camera and during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music knob is teensy tiny, rendering a proper press almost impossible - you just need to push it with your nail. It's very helpful though, allowing you to pause your music without even taking the handset out of the pocket. If you started the player and locked the keypad, you'd still be able to stop it by a single click on that key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would've been absolutely fabulous if the music key was totally independent of the key lock - allowing you to resume playing without unlocking. This is not the case with our just-about-retail unit, but maybe the final firmware version will see to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bottomside we only see the rear cover latch - the tiny knob with a padlock pictogram we get to see more of lately - and the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Topside at the rear is the 3.2 megapixel camera lens. Right next to it is the photo LED and the camera light sensor. All the way at the bottom of the G705 are the random-sized dots of the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same pattern is replicated - with a purely ornamental purpose - on the padding of the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover unveils the standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Po battery with a capacity of 950 mAh. The same unit is widely used across quite a range of Sony Ericsson handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer claims the battery should provide up to 400 hours of standby and up to 10 hours of talk time in a GSM-only network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, battery life ranged over two to four days on a single charge, depending on GPS and Wi-Fi use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the G705 is a neat package that handles relatively well and offers a mixed bag of ergonomic comfort and blunders. A nearly great keypad and a handy music key offset against a questionable D-pad and card slot buried under the rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest letdown however is the rather cheapish build and feel for the features offered. Ah, and one last thing? Silky Gold makes no sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or maybe it does. It makes the alternative black styling - neat and low-key as it is - truly Majestic Black.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well-known user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi, built-in GPS and auto rotation are making their way into the midrange and that's the major novelty with G705. They are accommodated on the good old feature phone platform we've known and appreciated across a wide range of Sony Ericsson handsets. The G705 user interface is exactly what we saw in the C905 8MP Cybershot, some top-of-the-line Walkmans and nifty mid-ranger T700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet again, a nice place to start exploring the G705 interface and features is this nice little interactive tool over at the Sony Ericsson website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all recent Sony Ericsson phones, along with the typical 3 x 4 grid, the main menu uses a couple of alternative layouts: rotating and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar, which features tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access - a good enough reason to forget about the other options once you've tried them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A common feature of most Sony Ericsson phones is the dedicated Flight mode. When turning the phone on, you may opt to start it directly into Flight mode but the Sony Ericsson G705 cannot work in Flight mode unless a SIM card is inserted. The other irritating thing is that to get in or out of flight mode you will actually need to restart the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our handset had four themes preinstalled - Clarity, Back to black, Flowers and Gold Lines. Except for the default Clarity theme, the other three are flash based with very pleasing effects and extra features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G705 features the well-known Activity menu. The Running Apps tab of this menu offers basic multi-tasking - for example you can run two Java applications and in the same time listen to the radio or music player. The Activity menu also offers quick access to recent events, the web and My Shortcuts menu, which contains a user-defined list of shortcuts to favorite features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook good to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson G705 phonebook does not surprise with new features but all the good old stuff is at hand. As with all the latest Sony Ericsson phones, the G705 stores up to 1000 entries with a total of 7000 phone number fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. They are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose whether the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be displayed by default. Unfortunately, displaying both lists simultaneously is not an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook lets you auto save to SIM card any new contacts that you're adding to the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, the available details are distributed over five available tabs. The first is where you put the name and the numbers, the second holds email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture, custom ringtone, custom message tone and a voice command. The fourth goes for postal details. The last, fifth tab, is for making an additional note and adding a birth date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you enter a birthday, Sony Ericsson G705 prompts adding it to the calendar and setting a reminder, which we think, is a handy feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>G705 is handling calls trouble-free, no voice quality or reception issues. Earpiece sound is relatively loud and crisp. The integrated loudspeaker cannot compete with the rich, melodic and balanced sound of the C905, so listening to music on the speaker is not much of a treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Sony Ericsson G705 stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. More info on our test, and all results so far, are stocked here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. It is partitioned into four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to a single contact, only the last one gets recorded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Smart Search completes the telephony features. It automatically looks up all the contacts whose numbers contain the digits you type on the stand-by screen. In addition, it also lists the names that start with the letters corresponding to the digits.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reliable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson G705 offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages. The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox. When composing a message, a warning is displayed when you exceed the 160-character limit, to let you know that the message will be divided in two (or more if necessary) parts for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a rich T9 dictionary. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when typing SMS you could easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to sort messages by category, provided you defined a specific category for each message. Six of them come preinstalled: Business, Favorites, Follow Up, Fun, Holiday, Important, but categories are fully customizable as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If sorted by category, a big Inbox By Category tag appears instead of the standard small Inbox icon. Under it, the categories are displayed but only the ones that contain messages are shown, which is convenient. You can also delete all messages in a given category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A drawback is that in the general inbox there is no indication if a message has been assigned a category. There's no indication in messages that are already open either. The Manage Messages feature, along with Categories, offers wide-ranging customization options and improved message handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports push email to boost mobile email usability. Emails are delivered in the background (similar to SMS or MMS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in G705 supports dozens of settings and all types of encodings, just like some of the most advanced messaging devices out there. The phone can save attachments, no matter if they are supported or unknown file formats. Email messages can be sorted by size, date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the phone is unable to handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader. So the options are limited to plain text only and you should have that in mind if you're going for the G705.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Thumbs up for the Media Center<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 runs the flash-based Media Center, where you can find the Music Player 3.0 - a slightly abridged edition of Walkman player 3.0. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player supports numerous file formats, including MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC +, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player can naturally be set to run in the background. Sound is rich and crisp - as long you're using the player with a good headset, that is. If you are not willing to use the media player step-by-step structure, you can directly play a track through the file manager with its classic flat tree structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, while the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Fullscreen mode and screenshot capability are some other extras at hand. You can save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media center menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, YouTube, Games, RSS feeds and Settings icons. The settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto-rotate modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken and prebundled or uploaded images, and offers some extra options like mark as favorite and photo feed. Latest Photo provides quick access to most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year. When a month is open, it reveals a 3 x 4 grid of photo thumbs. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month. The highlighted photo is a bit larger for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section opens again as a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs with non-camera images, such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the full screen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a powerful tool for conveniently managing a vast collection of camera photos with great customization capabilities. Photo Tags displays previously marked favorite photos. The Up key on the D-pad offers quick access to sending options like: send as Picture Msg, as email, to blog, via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. The well known Pan and Zoom and slideshow feature are also on board. Finally, the G705 is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images thanks to its built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but kind of pushed aside with the timeline view missing. We actually doubt it this timeline feature will be available in future phones, as the trend is integrating Walkman and Cyber-shot features across the Sony Ericsson portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PhotoDJ, VideoDJ and MusicDJ are signature features for all Sony Ericsson phones, and are available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even beyond, yet extreme zoom in won't really do any good. Browsing full-res images didn't involve any lags at all, while zooming does take its time. The magnified section of the image loads in low quality, to only appear in full res after a couple of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu. The service itself has seen several changes to include features like "Find similar music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Midrange camera performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 sports a 3.2 MP fixed-focus camera with LED flash. The camera offers a basic range of features, geotagging being the most notable of them. The camera is capable of maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels with average file size of about 1 MB. The other important thing is the Cyber-shot styled interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Settings on toolbar with pop-up submenus and the Multi Menu are well known since K850 and do help the user experience. Traditionally, the viewfinder toolbar lets you control shoot mode, scenes, picture size, LED flash, self-timer, white balance, effects, and settings (Multi menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That the toolbar is only enabled for one-way scrolling is a certain drawback. To put this straight - in order to reach the Multi Menu you have to pass all the other settings on the toolbar, as it's the last item there. Looped browsing of items on the toolbar should be an option, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Built-in GPS enables Sony Ericsson G705 to add standard GPS coordinates to images. When browsing tagged images in the gallery, you have access to a "View on map" tab from the options menu, which displays your location directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The limited camera features and the lack of autofocus may have made you rush to a conclusion about image quality. Though our camera unit firmware is a pre-release version, we see quite good potential in the image quality. Yet we cannot upload as of now full size images, but will do this as soon as we get a final retail version in our hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 camera samples downsized to 1024 x 768 pixels:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 is also capable of capturing video but is limited to the unacceptable QVGA resolution at 15fps recorded in mp4 format.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 has an Access NetFront browser v3.4 featuring the extended home screen, also available in C905 and T700, which we recently reviewed. Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections. The appearance of the home screen changes in varying fresh colors each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Generation Web handset, Sony Ericsson G705 features web shortcuts on the alphanumeric keypad, which we already saw in action in the K660. Backlit in purple as soon as you launch the browser, they work in both portrait and landscape mode and let you control text input, bookmarks, homepage and zoom. These functions are fixed and cannot be turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. The dedicated full screen mode is replaced by the auto-rotate feature, which actually opens it in full-screen landscape mode. View modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom, and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson G705 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is a real pleasure to work with. Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page and the first match is immediately listed as soon as you type a letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-inclusive connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options of G705 are full service. Quad-band GSM/HSCSD/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G are all on board, so there is virtually no spot on Earth (if GSM applies) where you will be unable to connect. In addition, you've got the fastest data transfers around, provided that a HSDPA-enabled network is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, Sony Ericsson G705 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other major connectivity feature is the built-in Wi-Fi with DLNA support. GPS with A-GPS function completes the tally. Last, but not least, there is also the M2 card slot which might just turn out to be one of the quickest means of transferring data on some occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G705 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB connectivity has four modes - one for file transfers (Mass Storage) and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third one is media transfer, which directly connects to the Windows media player, and gives full access to tracks placed on your phone, synchronization, and play or sorting in playlists. The last one is for direct printing of images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G705 is notable for completing the connectivity options with Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, as the official information goes, the maximum transfer rate via the Wi-Fi connection goes only up to 5 Mb/s (yes, that's megabits not megabytes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi connectivity is integrated rather well in the user interface and quite user-friendly. Once you turn it on, you get a list of the available wireless hot spots. Connecting is a matter of single click. It is also available via "My shortcuts", just in case you don't want to look for it in the menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser and all other data traffic is re-routed through the Wi-Fi connection by default, when you are connected. If Wi-Fi connection should fail, the browser automatically starts to use GPRS or higher speed network connection, if available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you won't have to guess whether Wi-Fi is engaged or not, as it has an icon on the top status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto connect, Wi-Fi networks priority, and assigning a favorite network are among the nice and very practical features in the Wi-Fi interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional settings allow you to search networks by their SSID, check your connection status or MAC address (you cannot change that).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson G705 offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Alarms, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Light, Calculator, and Code memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly and weekly views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages; the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarms are part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the well known basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED light on the back of the phone can also be used as a torch, thanks to the Light application. The LEDs can be on continually or for a period of one minute only. They can also blink out an SOS signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include MusicDJ and VideoDJ. VideoDJ is for making your own video clips by mixing already existing ones with still pictures, text and a variety of effects or for making basic cuts using special transitions and adding background music. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A whole suite of applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, the Sony Ericsson G705 comes with several applications preinstalled: AccuWeather.com, Comeks Strips, Standby World 3D, Walk Mate, Wayfinder 7 and the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AccuWeather app gives you up-to-date weather information for locations of interest to you. It provides detailed information about the current weather conditions in the selected region, as well as a 3-day forecast. You should bear in mind that it requires an internet connection and data charges may apply.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Comeks Strips is an application that lets you add speech bubbles and various comic-style add-ons to your camera photos. The comics you make can be then saved or sent via MMS. Making comics is fun and easy following the step-by-step wizard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Standby World 3D is a nice application with readings for up to three different time zones around the world. The background changes as day turns into night in the selected locations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walk Mate is a simple step counter application, which works in background mode based on the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarking favorites and so on. A major drawback is that you cannot use Wi-Fi to browse the YouTube content!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, the Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled in the G705. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all features of the Location services internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance, based on the available information in the database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view. Traffic information is another important feature here. The user interface is nice and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60 minutes period. GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is as easy as it could be. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Log application in the Location services tracks and saves each position request, which is accessible at any time afterwards. Each entry in the log is saved in descending order by date and displays the date and time, as well as the exact GPS position.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wayfinder Navigator 7 navigation software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wayfinder Navigator 7 is the real deal navigation software but in previous Sony Ericsson models it offered time-limited trial turn-by-turn navigation and then required a paid monthly subscription. We guess the situation with the G705 won't be much different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Route planning is extensive, there's pedestrian mode, as well as the option to avoid toll roads. Routes can be optimized for either time or distance. You are allowed to choose among tree modes of voice prompts: complete, fewer or none.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other navigation modes are 2D map, guide and automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Overview map with day and night modes is also onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Sony Ericsson G705 the built-in GPS gets used not only with Google Maps but with the proprietary fitness application called Tracker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app allows you to keep track of your speed, distance, route, and calories during training. Using the Tracker doesn't require connection to the Internet, and there are no costs related. When the Tracker application is launched and "Start training" is selected the application looks for available satellites. Users can choose between time, distance, route based or no limit trainings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu of the Tracker application consists of Start training, Routes, Results, Summary, and settings submenus. Under Routes the routes covered so far are stored. The distance covered is shown in either meters or kilometers. Each route can be viewed in a graphic map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Results sorts all the activities in a calendar month view. Sessions saved for the particular month are indicated by a small icon. The same holds true when day view is selected. Each result can be analyzed in graph or replayed. The graph shows the average speed and the activity total time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the settings menu there are plenty of customization options for the Tracker - units, energy consumption, personal profile, auto save routes, etc. In the personal profile you are prompted to enter details as gender, height, weight, and year of birth. Having defined a speed zone when starting a training session, you will be prompted with phone vibration and on-screen text to speed up or slow down to keep within the preset speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the Tracker application - it proved a handy piece of software. Bear in mind that it requires access to satellites and cannot be used in covered areas such as indoor gyms or the like.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games are good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G705 features three games: Brain Juice, JewelQuest2 and Super Breakout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Brain Juice is quite entertaining game and involves solving mathematical problems, memory games and pattern recognition exercises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JewelQuest2 is a puzzler game. You have to rearrange precious relics to turn tiles into gold as you advance through the interesting levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the Super Breakout to be the most entertaining among the preinstalled games. It has decent graphics and is full of block-breaking action over diverse levels and bonus stages you can unlock.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Guts to stand up to smartphones and utterly self-effacing looks is a nice little twist we guess. It's like the G705 is there saying "Misjudge me, be my guest".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, with a feature set like that, looks are the last thing it needs to boost self-esteem. Actually, if that's how midrange spec sheets are shaping, we dare not imagine what better treats future top devices hold in stock for us. If nothing else, Sony Ericsson G705 deserves credit for pioneering the shift.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's exactly why it needs some more personality, we think. It doesn't have to stun onlookers. No need to have GPS, Wi-Fi and HSDPA engraved in gilded letters. The solid skill and good headstart from the main competitor - which is hardly a looker itself - are strong enough assets. We just don't want it to drown in the mass of faceless low and midrange Sony Ericsson sliders. The G705 is just better than that.</paragraph>
