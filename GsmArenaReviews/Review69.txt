			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that we have the B7610 OmniaPRO running on the much-awaited Windows Mobile 6.5, we're finally up to speed. Omnia smartphones have a pretty wide reach already and they are known for their WinMo customizations and feature-rich specs sheets. The B7610 OmniaPRO however was the first family member to sport a full hardware keyboard and by the looks of it, Samsung have done a great job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Side-sliding or not, the B7610 OmniaPRO is definitely a capable device in both hardware and software equipment. The QWERTY keyboard however is a convenience tool usually reserved for the competition's high-end offerings, so you can bet the OmniaPRO will have to tackle some really capable contenders. But you can easily tell, it a tough nut to crack as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Who is the OmniaPRO is a multiple choice question. And there is more than one correct answer. The original Omnia has produced such an offspring choosing names became a problem. They even had to name one of the kids after the uncle. If you've been keeping track, you'd know the OmniaPRO has an Armani-branded alter-ego - the B7620. But well, Giorgio was lucky. The B7610 OmniaPRO less so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, there's nothing wrong with the name except that there are another couple of Pros in the family. And perhaps too many of them in other houses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've never had a doubt about the quality of the Omnia genes but such a strong and versatile lineup perhaps exceeds the most optimistic scenarios. Samsung are obviously not only trying to update their portfolio but confront their key market rivals by matching competing devices spec for spec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7610 OmniaPRO will be engaging the enemy on the high end of the performance and pricing scale. And that's where even the smallest details count. The B7610 doesn't have a unique defining feature like the Omnia HD to give it an edge against some unforgiving rivals. So, it will have to squeeze every bit of performance out of its system. It can count though on Samsung's solid record in multimedia and interface customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the custom-made TouchWiz looks and feels better than ever. So much that it's worth the spoiler. And the mode switch for toggling Work and Leisure is keen to make a point that this here Pro knows good fun too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the B7610 OmniaPRO will be trying to make its mark. And so will be Windows Mobile yet again. Because the OmniaPRO is certainly not running against PocketPCs only - the competition's finest will stand on its way. That's Symbian, and Android, and Maemo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO dimensions of 112.6 x 57.8 x 16.2 mm are just a tad easier to swallow than the heft of the HTC Touch Pro2. The Samsung is also almost 20 grams lighter, but frankly, both are massive handsets indeed so the differences aren't that obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the B7610 OmniaPRO is a solid offer even if not among the most impressive we've seen. Anyway, a spare stylus and an 8GB microSD card make a good enough set. The rest in the retail box is the compulsory charger, USB cable, 3.5mm wired stereo headset, quick user guide, manual and a CD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Massive body and all, the B7610 OmniaPRO is not much of a charmer. Even the coolest finish wouldn't hide the beer belly and we've seen some of the competition do way better. XPERIA, anyone? Even the HTC Touch Pro2 is carrying its weight with a lot more dignity and grace. It's heavier and thicker but has a tilting screen and a brilliant 5-row QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung tried to be more creative on the rear with the red battery cover. Decent though it is, it doesn't quite match the rest of the handset's exterior and does feel a bit out of place with this Pro here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large 3.5" AMOLED touchscreen of WVGA resolution dominates the front panel. The high resolution and the AMOLED technology guarantee excellent image quality but only just. The 65K-color limitation of the WinMo OS results in occasional banding. It's mostly visible in single color gradients and the large high-res screen makes it more prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance under direct sunlight is not on par with most of the HTC devices. Worse yet, the HTC's top PocketPC has beaten everyone to the debut of capacitive touchscreen on the Windows platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sensitivity is decent for a resistive screen but nowhere near the experience of the capacitive-like units in Samsung S8000 Jet and the Samsung M8910 Pixon12. Samsung claim the OmniaPRO display is advanced R-type but, under whatever name, it can't beat the precision and response of a nice and simple capacitive screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But leaving that aside, the main issue of the display is sunlight legibility. On a bright sunny day the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is quite difficult to work with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting down to basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Starting our tour of the Samsung OmniaPRO controls, first off are the three hardware controls below the screen - the Call and End buttons, and the menu key. All the Menu key does is toggle the main menu on and off (the custom Samsung variety - not the honeycomb). In our humble opinion, the HTC approach with dedicated Home and Back keys is better. The controls are prominent enough for comfortable handling and have solid press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the front panel are the ambient light sensor, the proximity sensor and the video-call camera. The proximity sensor makes sure you won't press anything on the display by accident when you're in a call. Unfortunately, the OmniaPRO doesn't have the active stylus of the HTC Diamond2 and Touch Pro2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the volume rocker and the Business &amp; Leisure mode switch. The Mode switch is a handy control that lets you to toggle between two different sets of setups on your B7610 OmniaPRO. You can assign different user interface settings each and alternate them with a single click. A nifty little feature that we like - even if it's nothing new - Nokia Eseries have it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of Samsung B7610 hosts the screen lock button and the dedicated camera key. Those are both large and tactile enough to allow trouble-free operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is perfectly plain with no controls whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the B7610, in contrast, is rather crowded. This is where you can find the 3.5mm standard audio jack, microUSB port and the stylus compartment. Both connection ports are covered with plastic lids.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slide in and slide out<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open reveals the four-row QWERTY keyboard. We are pretty fond of the sliding mechanism as it locks firmly in both positions and slides in and out very smoothly. The spring-assisted slide responds readily to a gentle flick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard itself is a real treat. The keys are large and quite solid to press so you can type at enviable speed. Numbers are placed on the top row of keys - instead of using a numpad layout.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A different perspective<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The back of Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO accommodates the 5 megapixel camera lens, dual LED flash and the loudspeaker grill. There is a slightly protruding frame around the camera lens to shield it from scratches but there is no actual lens protection so you still need to be careful with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is hot-swappable but is located under the rear cover, which you will have to remove every time you change cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1500 mAh battery is the other noteworthy thing below the back panel. It's rated at up to 480 h of standby time and up to 6 h of talk time on a 3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: We put the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO to some real-world usage for a few days to see how it performs in terms of battery life. We used it on a 3G network, with the screen set to comfortable brightness level - about 25% of the maximum but on an AMOLED screen that's plenty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From fully charged, the battery went to 40% after good 4 days of standby, which included 15 minutes of calls, an hour of music listening, 45 minutes of XviD video watching and finally, 30 minutes of web browsing over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most stressing for the battery was the XviD video playback. Simply staying with the screen lit seemed quite sparing on the battery. That's a good news to e-book readers and bad news to video watchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the B7610 OmniaPRO will definitely last you several days of regular usage, or at least a full day if you're in a traffic jam and have a lot of 30 Rock episodes on the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO fares pretty well in terms of ergonomics but we're less than impressed with its styling. Size is not that much of an issue but it feels the handset - so unlike Samsung - doesn't meet the dress code.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC TouchPro2 and Nokia N97 simply have have a more powerful presence. And we don't mean the tilting screens only.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz UI gets better, doubles the homescreens<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO runs the latest incarnation of Windows Mobile - version 6.5. We managed to get it updated from the original Windows Mobile 6.1 that it came with. But you'd never guess we're running WinMo here as Samsung have completely redecorated the place. The only giveaway is the Start button, otherwise the stock WinMo interface is almost completely out of sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Phonebook to the Settings menu, everything is covered by the custom-made interface. Even the settings themselves have been reorganized to resemble those of the Samsung touchscreen feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, it's TouchWiz all over and it's been upgraded - it has two homescreens, or two user modes if you like, called Life and Work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leisure mode, a.k.a. Life, uses the well-known widget-based, three-pane homescreen that was TouchWiz from the very beginning. The Work mode has more subdued styling than the colorful wallpapers of the Life homescreen and while it uses widgets too, they work in a different way and are generally more practical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets in Work mode are arranged vertically as tabs on the scrollable homescreen and their order is customizable. Each tab is also scrollable sideways if there is more content that needs to be displayed (there's an indicator showing the current view of the widget and the number of extra pages in total).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Life mode widgets are the usual mini applications that you can arrange freely on the three different homescreen panes. In either mode, if the user needs to place a new widget on screen all they need to do is click the arrow at the bottom left corner of the homescreen and pull the widget tray out. To get rid of an unwanted widget you need to drop it back into the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz approach is quite similar to what we saw on the Samsung I8000 Omnia II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-made main menu is similar to the ones found in their feature phones. It can have up to 10 pages with shortcuts and each page has a title.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, it's a lot more organized than the new honeycomb Start menu of Windows Mobile 6.5. The Others button in the lower left corner brings up a single scrollable page with all the shortcuts not in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For multitasking, Samsung have provided two separate tools. The first is the Task switcher, which you can open by long-pressing the center key or by the dedicated button in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is very convenient for switching between apps and has two view modes - grid and a horizontal string of pages with nice transitions. It also offers basic controls for the music player. The one gripe we have with the Task switcher is that the long press required to start it is way too long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Task manager that displays more information about programs (RAM and CPU footprint) and can also display all the running processes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen has a slider at the top of the display. Sliding it left or right unlocks the phone, but there's another feature of the slider - if you have missed calls, their number is displayed on the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping it, reveals a second slider, which brings you straight to the cal log. Or if you have a new message, the second slider brings up the Inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the lock screen, just bellow the time and date, any scheduled appointments from the calendar will show up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two back buttons. The center key on the front switches between the currently active app and the main menu. There is another one, on the hardware QWERTY, which serves as a confirm button. The difference is that it actually closes the app, instead of just switching to the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another convenient feature on the B7610 OmniaPRO. The Composer shortcut gets you straight to business - it launches a screen with shortcuts to get you directly to writing messages, making calendar entries or notes, or running a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we're very pleased with this latest incarnation of TouchWiz and especially the Today plugin used by default for the Work mode. It can be easily fine tuned and presents information in an orderly and easily accessible manner, which is what really counts for business users.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Peeling off the TouchWiz skin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is a PocketPC and there's no away around it. Sooner or later, you'll bump into the cold reality of Windows Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the latest WinMo available, but as you've probably heard time and again Windows Mobile 6.5 is just a spruced up version of 6.1. Prettier, more touch-friendly UI controls do not remedy the underlying problems with usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will have a quick glance at it here, but if you want a more detailed version of this part you can also check out our Windows Mobile 6.5 review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first change introduced by the new OS is the scrollable homescreen. The different items in the list are also scrollable sideways, giving you more functionality per line. For example, scrolling the Getting started item sideways allows you to set the clock, email account, device password, Bluetooth, custom wallpaper, custom ringtone, upload music and finally even remove the Getting started item for good once you're ready setting up the essentials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next major change is the new Windows Mobile Main menu. It comes in the honeycomb pattern that's supposed to boost touch-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the new main menu you've got all the installed programs plus shortcuts to the settings menu. Unlike the Omnia II, where the settings menu looked just like the main menu, on the OmniaPRO it is always covered by the Samsung TouchWiz and looks exactly like on any of the company's feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The perfectly flat structure of the Main menu can surely get a bit clumsy in time due to the huge number of icons piling up, but still we'd prefer that over the confusing experience that so many Widows Mobile new adopters have had in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also some other minor changes such as larger font that allows for more thumbable operation in most menus and the option to alternate tabs by simple finger sweeps wherever Windows offers you tabbed screens. You no longer need to aim for the tiny titles at the bottom of the screen as on the WinMo 6.1 handsets - you just sweep your finger across the screen and the next tab opens instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ARM 1176-based CPU by Samsung clocks as high as 800MHz and allows the OmniaPRO to offer great performance, even with the high resolution display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We used the Spb Benchmark software to test the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO performance. Understandably, compared to the OmniaLITE, it was a bit behind in the graphic part of the test - it has four times as many pixels to draw on screen. Memory speed tests were mostly a draw, but strangely, the OmniaPRO lost in the CPU benchmarks. We ran the tests several times and ended up with the same results over and over again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even way back when the WinMo phonebook was one of the unfriendliest platforms one could imagine, the phonebook did an excellent job. Contact management has always been one of the strong points of the OS having its roots heavily in PDAs with unlimited phonebook capacity and brilliant synchronization options. But it's all the more sweeter now that it has the looks to match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook application of the Samsung OmniaPRO has a nice and simple interface and it is clear that it was developed with touch-operation in mind. The graphics are nice and navigation is intuitive enough to make sure your work with it is trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz UI also has editing contacts completely customized. It gives you a nice and simple interface, similar to the company's feature phones. You have a plethora of available info fields but no option to rename any in case something has been missed - not that there ever was an occasion when we felt that was the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact, there is a shortcut in the context menu that takes you to your recent calls with the person in question. You can also add it to the reject list or the speed dial numbers straight from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you are into grouping your contacts - the B7610 OmniaPRO has that covered too. The first four groups are pre-configured, the rest left to your imagination and specific needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: nothing missing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung made it clear with the previous Omnia handsets that telephony was never compromised, despite the fact that the extra features are somewhat becoming the main reason for buying a mobile phone. The B7610 OmniaPRO has excellent in-call sound and no reception issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application offers Smart dialing, which means you will hardly ever need to go to the Contact list in order to dial a number. There is also the option to record a conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the OmniaPRO the cool feature to mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. Turning it face up starts the ringer again. The proximity sensor makes sure there are no accidental presses during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log on Windows Mobile devices offers practically unlimited entries. Samsung also pimped up the looks and added the nice extra sorting options. You can sort the entries alphabetically by name or by frequency of occurrence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also conducted our traditional speakerphone test to round off the phone part of the OmniaPRO review. It turned out disappointing - it achieved only an Average mark. This means we've seen (or rather heard) a lot better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is king<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging on the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is well heeled in terms of software. The handset can manage SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a nice message editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email editor has also been nicely skinned by the TouchWiz UI but there are no major changes in terms of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest mid or high-end phones. You type your username and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the available text input options on the OmniaPRO, it's clear that the weapon of choice is the hardware QWERTY keyboard. We looked at it in the hardware section of this review, so here we'll cover the software keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional WinMo QWERTY keyboard is of course included, but it's not a real option - the keys are too tiny for even the stylus. The Samsung QWERTY keyboard is much better with its ample sized keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't work in landscape mode though. You can trick it by sliding out the hardware keyboard, which forces landscape orientation. But it becomes immediately clear why it's not available by simply turning the phone - it barely leaves a single line of the text box visible on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the usual way around this is to have the landscape QWERTY appear in a new screen, but this solution is limited too - for example, the web browser can't offer suggestions because the text is entered in a separate window. All in all, a landscape on-screen QWERTY is not much of an option on the B7610 OmniaPRO. But it wasn't badly missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good ol' handwriting recognition is available too. The phone does a marvelous job of recognizing the letters and symbols we scribbled even when we used our fingers. And of course, the stylus makes it a lot easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The so-called Photo app is the main picture viewer on the OmniaPRO. It's got all its bases covered - convenient one finger zooming, browsing by date, slideshow with plenty of options and eye candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an image loads it in a single view where you can zoom or slide to the next one. There are dedicated on-screen buttons for zooming, which toggle on and off automatically. Double tap zooming is also available although, unlike the Omnia II, the B7610 OmniaPRO zooms in on the center of the image rather than the spot where you tapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also implemented the one-finger zooming we came to know since the S8000 Jet. You just need to hold it on the screen for a second and then drag up or down for zooming in or out. This method works in both galleries (as well as the web browser) and it is at the very least as convenient as the pinching gesture on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is, of course, slideshow functionality and you can adjust the direction, slide time and transition effect. It works fine and combined with the huge screen turns the phone into a perfect slideshow device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting the phone to its side or opening the QWERTY keyboard escapes the mundane grid arrangement. It displays your photos in a 3D arc and they slightly overlap each other. You then scroll them with a sweeping finger gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a second arc of thumbnails crossing the current one - and it holds the folders. So with a single move you can scroll either the images within a folder or the whole list of folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An alternative landscape view is available, which displays a 5 x 4 grid of photos with a timeline slider underneath. You can scroll horizontally by swiping sideways (this method works with kinetic scrolling) or you can use the time slider to select a particular month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's all pretty smooth and generally one of the nicest gallery apps as far as user-experience is concerned. Samsung's attempt to create a superior photo browsing app that sports 3D graphics and an innovative interface is really commendable. And so is their general effort to give WinMo the total interface makeover that it needing for quite some time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Touch Player is impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have wisely decided to give WinMo users a new touch-friendly media player and spare them the inconvenience of installing a third-party one to substitute for the poor default WMPlayer. The one that comes on the B7610 OmniaPRO is identical to what we already saw on the Omnia II we previewed not so long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It handles both video and audio files, supports playlists and has the standard album/artist/tracks sections. DNSe and SRS technologies are available in just a coupe of clicks and can really enhance the headphones sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two main views available in the B7610 OmniaPRO player. The first one is the Library - at the top you have six tabs: all music, albums, artists, genres, videos plus Now Playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch into play mode, you see a simple and clean interface. It has the standard music buttons you would expect - volume, skip, play/pause and shuffle, while the album art fills most of the screen above them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options menu offers the ability to play the music faster/slower or to set the track as a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing video is very simple - it's done the same way as an audio file. The player interface looks the same, but tapping twice turns on the fullscreen mode. It has the same control buttons as the standard one, but everything is intended for landscape orientation and there is no taskbar at the top or empty black spaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting the OmniaPRO to the side switches to a cover-flow-like view. For audio albums, it displays the album art and offers an alphabet scroll at the bottom for quick searching. For videos, it displays a video frame instead of album art and lacks the alphabet scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the OmniaPRO has full DivX and XviD video support, it successfully managed to playback all test videos we trew at it - up to VGA resolution and 2Mbps bitrate, that is. With DLNA and TV-out functionality, this is quite the pocketable movie player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We made out traditional Core Player benchmarks with the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO along and compared them with the HTC HD2 and the Acer neoTouch. Surprisingly, the OmniaPRO performed very poorly, well bellow what the Snapdragon duo. Check out the results below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>28 Days Later DivX trailer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transformers XviD trailer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Home-made DVDRip movie 640x272 resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, videos looked excellent on the high resolution AMOLED display, though the inability to handle high bitrate videos is a point against it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is good to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO has a really neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio also has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel during reception, the OmniaPRO should take care of auto-switching to the regional frequencies of your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset also supports radio broadcast recording and of course can be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for only six shortcuts to your favorite stations on the radio app screen. Saved stations appear as notches in the landscape version of the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In that mode, you can swipe sideways to change the frequency and there's kinetic scrolling available to make things faster. The only complain we have is that you have to manually slide it to the notches of saved stations, it won't snap automatically. That can be a pain at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is great - there are no major weak spots whatsoever. The handset did excellently in most parts of our test, achieving some pretty impersive scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cut-off in the extreme low bass frequencies (seen on the graph) are our only grudge about the OmniaPRO audio output. In the rest of the range however the handset fares very well, with the largest deviation being only 0.19dB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The THD, noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are nothing short of excellent and the intermodulation distortion is among the better in the class. Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera does a nice job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is capable of capturing 5 megapixel photos and D1 video clips. There is dual LED flash to assist with low-light pictures and videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface is exactly the same as on its Omnia II sibling. Comfortable and nicely touch-optimized, it has most of the controls you'll need in the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic options are here - ISO, white balance, default storage, stabilizer, etc. WDR is available, which continues to make its way into many recent Samsung cameraphones. You can switch the default storage between the phone memory and the microSD card. Hip camera features like geotagging, face detection and smile shutter are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO pulls off decent image quality with a good amount of resolved detail and reatively noise-free photos. However the contrast is rather low and brighter areas are often overexposed. On the upside, there is a good balance between the noise reduction and sharpening algorithms, which doesn't blur out the details and doesn't oversharpen the edges either.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the OmniaPRO can offer D1 resolution (720 x 480 pixels) at 30fps. There is also support for slow-motion QVGA videos at 120 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the one of the still camera, except for the fact that some options have been disabled. Pity one of them is anti-shake which would have been really useful here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the videos are not as nice as we expected. Compression is waaaay too much, which makes talking about image quality pointless. The so called "slow motion" video capture was a disappointment too - it is limited to QVGA resolution and the frame rate was very low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still D1 resolution video recording is quite rare in WinMo devices so we're willing to let that one go without serious grudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the sample videos: D1@30fps sample, a VGA@30fps sample, and a QVGA slow-mo sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity could have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity, the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is pretty much as well geared as a handset can be - HSDPA 3.6 Mbps, Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth. The lack of faster HSDPA and complete lack of HSUPA are a bit disappointing - the Pro is practically identical to the mid-range Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The network connectivity options of the touchscreen handset include quad-band GSM support and dual-band 3G (900/2100 MHz). In case you are wondering what bands your regional 3G network supports you can check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 is supported as well through a microUSB port. When connected to a computer, the OmniaPRO automatically connects in either ActiveSync or Mass Storage mode - whatever you preset in the Settings menu. Unfortunately, there's no option to be prompted every time you pair the handset to a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OmniaPRO has a microSD card slot to expand the 2GB internal memory. Cards up to 32GB are supported, but unfortunately the card slot is under the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA and TV-out boost the capabilities of the OmniaPRO - for example, you can view photos from the phone on a DLNA-enabled TV set. Or you could use the OmniaPRO to imbue an older TV with DLNA powers through the TV-out. At any rate, the media connectivity options are thoroughly covered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser: Internet Explorer Mobile vs. Opera Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO comes with a couple of excellent browsers preinstalled to make best use of its rich connectivity. You get Opera Mobile v9.5, plus the new version of Internet Explorer Mobile courtesy of the WinMo 6.5 update. The IE Mobile is this time actually good for something unlike its previous iterations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both browsers are supposed to support Flash (we've seen it on other phones) but our OmniaPRO had issues with it. Namely, no Flash content was displayed at all. It seems the Flash Lite plugin was missing - we tried installing it but that didn't help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mobile v9.5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have been keeping track you would know that the Opera browser is extensively touch-optimized and draws inspiration from the iPhone's Safari. The browser has matured and now exhibits no rendering bugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mobile v9.5 is heavily optimized towards vertical scrolling you can scroll complex pages without missing a beat. Panning sideways is a little slower - a checkerboard pattern appears for a moment before the content is drawn, but this lasts for only a moment so it's no big issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in and out is also very fast. You can use the one-finger zooming pattern that we described in the gallery and it works like a charm much like it did on the original Omnia. Double tapping is also very accurate as it zooms in to where you tapped, eliminating the need for much panning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WVGA resolution of the ample display helps navigation a great deal - at the minimum zoom level text is readable enough for you to find the section of the text you're interested in and double tapping takes you straight there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In landscape mode, the minimum zoom fits most pages, which is extremely convenient as it gives you a nice overview of the site, while the fine text still remains readable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser orientation is changed automatically of course, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of the Internet Explorer Mobile web browser has received a nicer touch-optimized interface and way cooler design. It shares most of the Opera Mobile goodies, like kinetic scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the high-res screen we were very comfortable using the desktop mode as web pages look much more natural that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming though is best done with the double tapping on the IE. It works like a charm, though we would have appreciated the one finger zoom, like Opera's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, you have to go through the menu or hold you finger over the screen and go through the context menu to make a slider appear. You can then use it for controlling the zoom but there is no Fit-to-screen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on the Samsung Omnia II, there's no automatic screen rotation in IE despite the built-in accelerometer. Luckily, on the B7610 OmniaPRO you can switch to landscape mode by simply sliding out the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lack of URL suggestions as you enter an address was a letdown too. The only help you get is suggestions of the currently typed address with automatically appended .com, .net, .org, etc. The lack of a "Search on page" option was also quite annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panning and scrolling isn't as smooth as on Opera Mobile, though unlike it, panning sideways doesn't show the checkerboard pattern. The high resolution screen fits plenty of text landscape, but it's quite annoying to have to wait for the checkerboard sections to be rendered and displayed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is skinned much like everything else<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with desktop MS Outlook. With B7610 OmniaPRO, the old WinMo Calendar is gone and has been replaced by the Schedule app. It's the same as the Touch Calendar we've seen before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Schedule application is extensively touch-optimized and feature-full. It offers daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly and agenda views but there are no different appointments available for setting up. Instead you get a single appointment item that you can place in different categories but you always get the same fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can filter events by categories if you wish and each category can have a different color. There's no support for cutting, copying and pasting of events though. Any of the available view modes can be set as default and you can choose the first day of the week to be either Monday or Sunday. The default WinMo calendar is available as well, if you're more comfortable with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tasks application allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. Unfortunately, it is one of the places where the old WinMo interface breaks the surface - no glossy UI or touch-friendliness here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. It too is the stock app, but there's an alternative called Memo (previously called Smart Memo), which has received the TouchWiz treatment. You get different colors and brush sizes plus you can zoom in and out of those notes. You can even save them as JPEG files or send them over MMS, email or Bluetooth if you want to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Recorder and the Calculator need no explanation - their interface is only slightly polished, compared to previous-generation WinMo devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock allows you to set a vast number of alarms to act as either wake-up or reminders. The dedicated wake-up alarm has three slots, which should allow you to wake up at different time in the different days of the week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can however set as many additional alarms as you want, each with its own name, repeat pattern, snooze time and ringtone. You also get to pick the volume and whether or not the alarm should power the phone on if it happens to be switched off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other extra features of the clock application are World clock application that can keep the time in as many time zones as you want, a stopwatch and an anniversary list. In the anniversary list, you can enter as many anniversaries as you want and optionally set up an alarm for each one to act as a reminder on either the day of the event or up to 7 days before it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final item in the organizing package is the neat and simple Unit Converter that offers weight, length, area, volume and temperature conversions. There is also a currency converter and a neat Tip calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File Manager deserves some attention too. It's a TouchWizified file explorer, which means it's easily thumbable, has an alphabet scroll and offers a tree view. The tree view is a nice option and will make navigating folders a more familiar experience to a lot of people. Aside from that, it covers all the file and folder management features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Document editor as good as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application. Office 2007 documents are supported (e.g. .DOCX, .XLSX) and the format is used by default when creating new documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only are they very good for viewing your office documents straight on the phone, but they also offer editing too. There are no extra charges - you are good to go straight out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are extremely pleased with the performance of the OmniaPRO in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on most handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5" screen offers plenty of room and the high-resolution means that text is readable even at low zoom levels. The B7610 OmniaPRO is an excellent device for document handling on the go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications aplenty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO has got plenty of preloaded applications, outside its organizing and multimedia packages too. There's the regular stuff such as an RSS Reader and a Streaming Media manager for a start but there's some new cool stuff also.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSS Reader application is rather self explanatory. It gives you quick access to RSS feeds for staying on top of the latest news and content on your favorite websites. The Podcasts application allows you to subscribe and download video and audio podcasts of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Digital Frame application allows you to use the B7610 OmniaPRO as a digital picture frame with content of your own and highly customizable styles. The app is nothing special, but still a welcome inclusion - AMOLED photo frames are still rare and expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have music playing in the background too and, if needed, event alerts such as incoming message or alarms can be suppressed when the Digital Frame is running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search Phone, capable of searching throughout applications and the whole file system. You have the option to set filters so that the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the OmniaPRO is equipped with two search applications - the other is named Smart Search and adds some nice graphics and transition effects to the whole searching thingy. Oh, and it's pretty good at actually finding what you are looking for too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MSN duo of applications - Money and Weather - is also here. Those are convenient tools for retrieving weather and stocks updates straight from you handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Windows Marketplace for Mobile is an integral part of the WinMo 6.5 experience. The application distribution solution should help third-party applications find their way from developers to the users' handsets by basically cutting off the middle man.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the new Marketplace application is pretty straightforward - it gives you shortcuts to the most popular applications, the most recent ones and category view. There is of course a search box too to make things easier as the number of applications grows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of now, there are over a 1000 apps available within the Marketplace, which is a lot more than when the service launched. There are free ones, but there are also a disturbingly many apps that command 30 dollars - and we're talking stuff that would hardly cost more than 5 dollars in the iPhone app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is nicely setup as well, offering user reviews, screenshots and, as usual, individual ratings. It's even accessible through a desktop browser, which is more convenient. If you buy an app through your computer, it will be downloaded the next time you start the Marketplace client.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS would be better off coupled with a satnav app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO features a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support. The assisted GPS allows for much faster satellite lock upon cold start thanks to current satellite data downloaded over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no navigation software preinstalled on the OmniaPRO so you will have to get one at your own expense. The free Google Maps app is included but that's it really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, GPS navigation software is a regional thing and on your local market the OmniaPRO can be pre-bundled with some sort of satellite navigation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the end of the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO review we're about to part ways with one solid device - the specs alone will tell you that much. But having held it in our hands we can safely confirm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its TouchWiz user interface is so far reaching, most of the time you can forget that you're using a Windows Mobile device. The excellent assortment of preloaded apps means you won't have to struggle with the aging interfaces of the default apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-homescreen bit is a great addition to the UI. Nokia has a similar feature, but that is reserved only for its business-minded Eseries. And the B7610 OmniaPRO is the epitome of a business device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can go on heaping praises on it but there are a few things that disappointed us. The plastic that the OmniaPRO is made of is no match for the metal casing it should have had. And the OS-related color support limitation leads to heavy banding on the screen, which really spoils the pleasant experience of a WVGA AMOLED display. Plus the 6.5 version of WinMo was not as snappy as ver. 6.1, we tested earlier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the B7610 will prosper in a business environment. The Office support is the best available on a mobile device and syncing options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The roomy, four-row keyboard is comfortable and easy to get used to. The touchscreen is very sensitive as well. Shame it's not a tilt screen though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But when it comes business, Samsung have got a whole family full of pros. Through out this review we've referred to the Samsung B7610 just as OmniaPRO, but that's not quite correct. Including the B7610, the "OmniaPRO" moniker covers three phones and two form factors in total:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   B7320 OmniaPRO ? B7330 OmniaPRO ? B7610 OmniaPRO</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its HTC-made nemesis is called HTC Touch Pro2. It is a WinMo-powered phone and its display is bigger by a hair at 3.6" with the same resolution. TFT vs. AMOLED doesn't matter much because of the 16-bit color resolution dictated by the OS. The CPU is slower but the RAM is only slightly bigger. But you get TouchFLO UI, which is still the king of custom interfaces for the Microsoft OS. Oh, and the QWERTY has five rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "other white meat" here is the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X2. It's mostly on par with the HTC Touch Pro2 in specs, except the smaller screen - 3.2". The 8MP camera trumps all the other alternatives we offer here. The modifications to the stock interface are not very extensive though, just the X-Panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Touch Pro2 ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menacing Motorola MILESTONE (or DROID in the US) also looms over the OmniaPRO's head. It's got a bigger screen with slightly more resolution (3.7" and 480 x 854 pixels), which is an excellent viewport to the MILESTONE's strongest point - Android 2.0 Eclair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 duo also makes bid for the most popular smartphones with a slide-out QWERTY and a touchscreen. We won't list their specs as the N97 mini review is still fresh. But for Symbian users, the N97 team is the smoothest transition to touchscreen-land.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia N97 ? Nokia N97 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we're pretty sure that power users are saving their cash for the Nokia N900. The Maemo OS is the most successful mobile Linux so far. We know, we know? Android uses the Linux kernel but even Google say that it's not Linux. Maemo is on the other hand is embracing its roots and your favorite open source apps are a quick port away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whew, that's quite a long list. And of all the phones listed, probably none will achieve the status as the QWERTY phone. But for many users, seeing the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO will be a love at first sight experience. Ignore the nay-sayers - the TouchWiz and WinMo combo performs excellently and for a business people with gadgety inclinations will love the keyboard, the smooth syncing and the excellent Office support.</paragraph>
