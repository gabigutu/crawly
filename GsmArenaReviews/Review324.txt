			<paragraph>It seems Samsung really takes making sleek looking and ultra thin mobile phones to heart. It's no wonder that the Samsung Ultra lineup has become a significant part of the company's mobile portfolio. We got hold of another Ultra Series II member, the Samsung U600, and we'll be more than happy to check if it hits the spot for you. Also known as Samsung Ultra 10.9, it perfectly fits the Ultra series bill and, what's more, looks all set to become its most successful member. Stylish and comfortable to hold are the two things that best describe the first impression the slim handset makes, but we are now to see if it performs as well as it looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U600 is considered to be the runner-up for leadership in the Ultra line II, behind Samsung U700, but that is not completely true. Actually the two phones come from two different research and development centers of Samsung and we would prefer to consider them as distinct products, rather than think of one being an upgrade of the other. Samsung U600 is a bit slimmer than U700 and stands at only 10.9 mm thickness. Actually that makes it the world's slimmest slider. Other U600 niceties that U700 lacks are the FM radio and TV out functionality, so that should be enough to prove that they differ in purpose more than they do in ideology and, therefore, class affiliation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>More than a fashion accessory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U600 is surely an eye-turner. In fact, its ultra slim and flashy design may lead people to believe that functionality is not his element. And, believe us, that would be an absolutely wrong assumption. Anyway, we'll get back to that later in our review. For now let's focus on the design. Samsung U600 will be available in several colors. We got hold of the Black Softfeel one and it certainly won our appreciation. The device itself measures 103.5 x 49.3 x 10.9 mm and weighs only 81 grams, so it fits perfectly in any shirt or trouser pocket. In fact, at most times you would hardly feel it's there. If your previous handset wasn't Samsung U100, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece opening can be seen just a few millimeters above the 2.22" display. By the way, the display itself is worthy of a few words, but we'll get to it a little later. Continuing our way through the front of Samsung U600, we come upon the touch-sensitive soft keys, that are located slightly above the D-pad. Below the soft keys are the Dial key and Delete/Menu-exit key, which are also touch sensitive. The final control here is the web access/confirm key in the middle of the navigation pad. We really aren't huge fans of the idea of placing the web access key there, as this results in unwanted starting of the web browser now and then, but that's just our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Samsung U600 features the volume rocker and the USB slot. The rocker had its place switched from the top end, where it was found on D900 to the bottom, right above the USB slot. A questionable decision indeed, as it is now susceptible to accidental pressing when talking on the phone. After all, this is exactly where you would normally hold a slider phone during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part holds no controls and is livened up only by a little ribbed design. Switching to the right side, we come across the microSD card slot and the dedicated camera key. They are located symmetrically to the controls located on the left side, i.e. at the lowest part of the side panel possible. This time accidental presses of the dedicated camera key are much less probable, as the key itself is very rigid and requires much more pressure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone contains the Power key, which is the last unmentioned control on the phone. It is situated at the right side and is very slightly raised above the shiny plastic that surrounds it. This way it's easier to press, despite its tiny size. The top of the phone and its "chin" (the bottom of the rear part of the slider that is not covered by the front when it's closed) are made of shiny plastic, whereas the rest of the phone is finished in opaque, but equally slick looking plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side is really plain. A slight gap is noticed where the battery cover ends. There are also two inscriptions - "Samsung" and "samsungmobile.com", which are placed at the top and the bottom respectively. When the slider is opened, the 3.2 megapixel camera appears at the top right corner while the led flash and the self-portrait mirror are located in the top left one. In between are the "3.2 megapixels" and "auto focus" labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the rear panel, opening the battery cover by simply sliding it to the top reveals the standard Samsung Li-Ion battery with the modest capacity of 690 mAh. The battery is supposed to last for 250 hours of standby time and 3 hours and a half of talk time. In reality the battery will give you about 2 to 3 days of moderate use, which is not too bad but still hardly a feat to brag about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open you reveal the keypad. Now, that's where phones this slim pay the price of better looks. There is no room for a terraced keypad and the flat keys render touch orientation impossible, despite their otherwise big enough size. Rows are separated by thin and very slightly lifted metal ridges, which is at least some direction, but the keys on the same row should definitely be looked at when typing, unless you want to make a whole bunch of typos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combination of touch-sensitive and regular keys is not very commonplace, so you might be interested how that works out with this phone. It did seem confusing to us at first but when we got used to it, turned out to be as operable as any other solution plus, it feels so much better and looks awesome</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pleased with the general build quality of Samsung U600. The sliding mechanism works seamlessly and there were no creeks and other strange noises for the time of our review. The phone feels light yet robust when held in hand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gloss all over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U600 has a large 2.22" TFT display with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. The impressions it leaves can vary greatly depending on the conditions during use. When exposed to direct sunlight, the glossy surface makes it practically illegible and finding a proper angle for working with it could be a tricky job. The sunlight mode, which adds more to the brightness isn't much of a help either. Legibility in such conditions is almost the same as with Samsung D900, although the latter doesn't sport a dedicated sunlight mode. Still, leaving this problem aside, the display on Samsung U600 deserves a standing ovation. It has an incredible picture quality with enough brightness and contrast to satisfy even the most demanding tastes. It does better than D900 and that is an achievement definitely worth praising.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Using Samsung U600 as a regular phone is almost as enjoyable as looking at its stylish casing. The sound levels are loud enough, while during calls the sound quality is as good as it might be expected in any phone of such respectable make.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung, as you always have some sort of dialing animation, or a choice of several ones. With the U600 you only have four animations: Quill pen, Sticky note, Normal and Theme with the latter varying a little according to the theme. The full Smart search feature can assist your dialing by looking up your phonebook for contacts whose names or numbers contain the digits you've typed. Samsung D900 for example doesn't have that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Samsung U600 ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our new speakerphone loudness test. More info on our test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung by heart<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U600 is controlled in a very similar way to former models of this maker. The main menu is accessible from the stand-by display through a press on the left soft key. The right soft key is reserved for the phonebook. The central key on the navigation pad launches the WAP browser in standby, as we already mentioned. At the same time, each direction of this primary control can be assigned a shortcut to a list of 22 items. Except for the up key, because it is reserved for opening the My menu, where you can configure your preferred and most frequently used functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stand-by display offers the typical Samsung looks. The top bar is reserved for standard details like signal strength, battery status, GPRS or EDGE connectivity, ringing mode etc. The bottom bar features description of the functions assigned to the soft keys. It also features the animated traveler background (uGo) with analogue clock we came to know since Samsung D900. It sets the background image according to the country where the phone is being used. Background wallpaper is animated: birds are flying in the sky, clouds are moving etc. From 7 pm till 6 am night mood takes over: the sunny sky gets dark, while houses get lit up. We saw that a feature we appreciated back in D900 lacks in U600 - that's the option to have a calendar display on the home screen in standby mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be displayed either as a 4 x 3 grid of icons or as a standard list. The menu has two color versions: a stylish black one, where only the selected icon is color-toned, and a more vivid and colorful white one. Sub-menus get visualized as pop-up windows accessible through the horizontal ways of the D-pad. Should you find that uncomfortable, you can access them directly. The much contested feature of all recent Samsung phones, where the last used items and sub-items are highlighted by default when you open a submenu is also present here. We like it this way and it proves useful when you use a given feature more than once. Still some may have other needs and will have every right to disagree. A nice innovation is the addition of three font sizes to be used throughout the user interface. A lot of people did miss that function in previous Samsung handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U600 automatically locks its keypad once you close the slider. You can then unlock it either by pressing the power key or by sliding the phone open. Whether closing the slider should stop the running application or not is also user-configurable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung U600 can store up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. It displays the names from the phone memory only or all names from both the phone memory and the SIM card at once. Searching employs gradual typing of the contact's name. Samsung U600 does not search in both the contact's first and last name. That is strange enough considering that this option was available back in Samsung D900. Maybe Samsung insist on using the smart search application in such cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A total of 12 fields of information are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, plus an email address and a note. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture. You can even set a video as "caller's image" - a feature that was absent in Samsung D900. Contacts can be organized into groups, but calls cannot be filtered based on groups. Unfortunately there is no birthday field, which we found quite inconvenient. Contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth. There is also an auto reject list to enable filtering of your incoming calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren't any changes or novelties in the call logging department. The Dial key on the touchpad opens a list of the recent contacts, while opening the Call log from the main menu will provide some additional details as well as call and message counters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U600 can create four types of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and emails. The first three share the same editor. You can covert your SMS to MMS by simply inserting an image, or to EMS by applying formatting or font colors. Naturally, a T9 dictionary is present and it does its job quickly and intuitively. If message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so it can be resent later. There is room for 1000 SMS in the phone's memory (Samsung D900, for example could only store 200). Incoming messages, like calls, can also be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is relatively good. It can manage up to five accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval (options vary from 1 to 12 hours)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SOS message function, which allows you to quickly send an SOS message to user-defined numbers, is present here too. It is available in most Samsung phones and is able to send a custom message to one or more pre-defined numbers. After setting up the feature, all you need in case of an emergency is to press the volume rocker 4 times with the keypad locked to send your cries for help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to security, this Samsung handset is also equipped with the uTrack function or the so called Mobile Tracker. When you set it up and your phone gets stolen, once somebody puts a SIM card other than yours in the handset, the U600 will start sending secret tracking messages to user-defined numbers. We are not quite sure if that will help you find your phone but that's the way people at Samsung see it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management: the Samsung way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U600 file browser is pretty much standard for Samsung handsets. The phone memory and the memory card are separated but they have similar folder structures. There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. Functionality of the file browser is one of the best among non-smartphones. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (save for the root ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth one by one or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent deleting them by accident. The downside we found in some Samsung handsets - the really slow reading speed from the memory card - is somewhat fixed here. Not that Samsung U600 is incredibly fast but it's fast enough not to bother us. Listing thumbnails of the pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card now takes shorter time than with Samsung E590 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U600 picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder. You can copy or move images but only to the Images folder on the memory card and vice versa. Much like with Samsung D900, you can view the pictures as a plain list or as a list with thumbnails. And again, you can sort files by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view it, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view the picture in portrait mode only and the only way the phone to display it fullscreen is by zooming in. This way however, parts of the picture get cropped.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image editing in its full shine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Scalado Image Editor - it's the same as the one in Samsung U700 and is much richer than the image editor we saw in Samsung D900 and Samsung E950. The Image Editor here allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and adjustments. Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items are also available. All in all, Scalado offers you virtually all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. However, we doubt that anyone takes image editing with their mobiles seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the Image stamp application to combine two pictures by using one of them as a watermark for the other.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with 60MB of internal memory and a microSD card slot, the Samsung U600 has every premise to act as a portable music player. The Music player application allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre or you can choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlist. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. The player in U600 has undergone several changes in terms of looks compared to D900 but its functionality remains the same. It has three equalizer presets plus a normal mode, but unluckily you still cannot create one of your own. The 3D sound effect is also an option. Track ratings and marking as favorites are also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality of another level<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We now come to testing the audio quality of Samsung U600. The great audio quality of the device sticks out a mile. A lot has been speculated on the integration of the Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEPower amplifier into the latest Samsung handsets such as U600. Some say that it's been giving Samsung handsets an edge in terms of sound quality. Well, this speculation is completely denied by our audio lab tests. It is obvious that what ICEPower gives Samsung is reduced power consumption, not better audio quality. In fact, our tests revealed that Samsung U600 performs exactly the same as Samsung D900, when it comes to audio quality, while the latter doesn't have an ICEPower module. It must also be noted that Samsung handsets easily surpass all competition, although they are not meant as music-oriented devices. Enough talking already, here are the test results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frequency response   Samsung U600 and Samsung D900 frequency response graphs match perfectly ? Samsung U600 vs Sony Ericsson K770</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with most Samsung handsets, the retail box will supply you with a wired headset that comes with a microphone and a remote control. It can be replaced only with another Samsung-branded headset due to the fact that Samsung U600 lacks a standard 3.5mm or even a 2.5mm jack. However you can use a Bluetooth headset for listening to music - both a mono and a stereo one will do the job, as Samsung U600 supports the Bluetooth A2DP profile. Furthermore, it can even play music on two Bluetooth stereo headsets simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U600 comes complete with an FM radio, which is once again doing quite well in terms of user interface. It has a self-tune option that finds all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS support that can be switched on and off depending on your taste.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does little but does it well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Music player and the FM radio have a similar interface; the same holds true for the video player interface, too. It doesn't have many features but all the essentials are covered - it can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos. As the camera records video in MPEG-4 format, you can rest assured that the player has full support for those - you can easily convert your videos to watch them on the go. Plus, the video player makes full use of the great quality of the display and plays the videos in their full shine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Little space left for the camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera placed in Samsung U600 is a 3.2 megapixel one with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. Its hardware options include flash and a little self-portrait mirror. The camera module of D900 obviously has proved to be too bulky to fit in the U600. So instead, a smaller module with supposedly a bit downgraded specifications is integrated. We didn't manage to check that thoroughly, as our unit had some problem that didn't allow it to properly focus on subjects further than a meter. Therefore no usable pictures at a distance greater than that could be produced with it. It is surely a unit-specific problem, and extremely improbable that you will have a similar problem. We'd rather blame it on our bad luck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least we were able to check its close range and macro shots and we were generally pleased with their quality. The same quality should probably be expected with longer range shots but we couldn't verify that, so we cannot be 100% sure. Overall, the camera quality is on the better side of 3 megapixel mobiles but not as good as the best examples in the range - Sony Ericsson K810 or even Nokia N73.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same as with Samsung E590 and Samsung E950. It is intuitive and follows the current trend of displaying settings with icons in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen, while options appear as popup menus. The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single, multi-shot and mosaic shot), color effects (sepia, antique etc.), white balance, and ISO. Operating only in landscape mode, the viewfinder uses the whole screen. Picture taking is on the fast side - a bit better than D900 and there is a very useful Namecard Recognition application. It manages pretty well with scanning business cards and recognizing names, mobile, home and fax numbers, and email, and placing them with surprising accuracy in their respective contact fields. There were a few mistakes of course but that is probably due to the very stiff shutter key. It requires too much pressure and it is impossible to hold such a compact phone still while using it. Other thn that the key has a half-shutter mode, you've used to seeing in most cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the video recording capabilities of the camera. Samsung U600 shoots video in the so-called Camcorder mode. Recording length is only limited by the available free memory. The user interface of the camcorder doesn't differ from the one of the still camera except for the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U600, as most other Samsung handsets, captures MPEG-4 videos. The maximum available resolution is CIF (352 x 288 pixels). Here is a sample video so you can see for yourselves whether the quality level is satisfying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample video</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser &amp; connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung U600 you can count on EDGE and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. The NetFront 3.4 web browser of the Samsung U600 is excellent for a feature phone - it renders pages well, with or without the Smart-Fit function. It offers a mini-map so you know where you are at on large pages, and it even has a virtual mouse pointer, which highlights the currently active hyperlink or field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone works seamlessly when transferring data to and from a PC. A notable enhancement to the Bluetooth File Browser service is the ability to make certain files or folders visible or invisible according to your needs. The USB connection has PC Studio, Media player and Mass storage modes. Each of them can be set as default, otherwise the user will be prompted for action upon connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The practical Samsung<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U600 calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are three types of events available: appointment, anniversary and task. The Calendar can store up to 100 items of each type. Much like D900, you can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of alarm slots has grown from three in D900 to five, each with a variety of configurable options - snooze time, repetition, etc. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will probably seem appealing to sports-minded users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final application worth mentioning in Samsung U600 is the integrated Picsel viewer. It supports viewing MS Word, MS Excel and PDF files but is once again on the slow side, which kind of ruins the whole experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Java world of trials<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to games, Samsung U600 is quite well prepared. A whole bunch of games are preinstalled on the phone just waiting for you to have some free time to spend with them. You can even download additional titles, should you need more. The games that the Samsung U600 bundles up are Bobby Carrot, TimeRider II, Asphalt Urban GT (trial), Midnight Pool (trial), Minigolf Las Vegas (trial), Tetris (trial).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So here comes the end of our review. We certainly had fun with this little baby but it's now time for our ways to part. But before we wrap up, one thing remains: the final words. Our verdict is that Samsung U600 is a very good phone overall. It has its flaws but none of them is too big. On the other hand, it offers no groundbreaking improvements. What we see is evolution rather than revolution. If you are looking for a sleek device with great multimedia capabilities, then Samsung U600 will surely be a strong nomination. In all honesty, the technology freaks are not very likely to go for the U600 purchase because there is a whole bunch of phones brimming with features. Then, the value-for-money buyers would look at the E590 for example, for about 60% of the price. Pretty much everyone else is bound to be attracted by the Samsung's slimmest slider, one way or another. All in all, the charismatic Samsung U600 will bring hours of enjoyable experiences to its owners.</paragraph>
