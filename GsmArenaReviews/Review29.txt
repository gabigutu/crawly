			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It took a little Magic and a Dream but Android eventually got a Hero to champion the OS. Now, the HTC Legend comes in an aluminum suit of armor to join the ranks of the Android army. So, is this knight in shining armor set to be the vanguard of the explosive growth of Android?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The predecessor of the HTC Legend, the Hero, pioneered Sense UI and this latest gadget follows suit, but brings some innovation of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend borrows a page from high-end laptop design ? the aluminum unibody. The unibody design was touted as a game-changing breakthrough when it hit the laptop market. A lot of that was marketing hype, but the fact is that unibody metal designs still have a distinct quality feel to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we jump into any details, we?ll go over the key aspects of the HTC Legend and what we found lacking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum body isn?t the only hardware upgrade the Legend got over the Hero, the TFT display technology has been switched in favor of AMOLED and that?s not all. Some of the other specs have also received a refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite trading plastic for metal, the Legend is actually slimmer around the waist than the Hero ? it?s just 11.5mm thick and it?s a pinch lighter too. Something that will evoke either a positive or negative response depending on the person is the move to an optical trackpad instead of the tried and true trackball.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android doesn?t have much use for a trackball or trackpad anyway, but this goes well with the more compact profile of the HTC Legend. Even the trade-mark chin has been all but flattened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page, we?ll tell you more about the feats (and features) of the HTC Legend, starting with the unboxing and the hardware.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Few surprises in the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the HTC Legend is pretty much the same as the one the Hero came in. It packs the essentials plus a couple of minor perks ? a 2GB microSD and a one-piece headset with music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The package also includes a microUSB cable, a charger that uses the USB cable to connect to the phone and the plug part is changeable (though the package arrives with only one plug, but plugs for other sockets are available on the Internet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are paper manuals too of course, plus a mini CD, though that just has more manuals. The HTC Sync software is preloaded on the microSD card in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset uses the standard 3.5 mm audio jack, so you can use your own instead, but this one is pretty nice, it has additional music buttons ? the call button doubles as a play/pause button and there are previous and next track buttons that can be used to fast forward and rewind too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Legend 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend is the heir apparent of the Hero, but we won?t be doing it justice if we neglected to mention that the Legend is the handsome younger brother of the Hero. The chin that goes back as far as the granddaddy of them all, the T-Mobile G1, has been straightened out, which combined with the thinner frame of the Legend, makes it more pocket friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 112 x 56.3 x 11.5 mm, the HTC Legend is compact in the age of 4? touchscreens, but isn?t the tiniest of smartphones. Its weight of 126 grams gives it an extra solid feel, though it doesn?t feel heavy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend preaches industrial design ? it?s a work of art as much as it is a work of precision engineering. For example, the chin that we mentioned several times even in its current, less pronounced state makes the Legend comfortable to with just three fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also lifts the phone a little when it?s placed face down, which keeps the screen from rubbing against the table surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame of the HTC Legend was milled out of a single piece of aluminum ? in fact, back at the MWC, the HTC booth had a display that showcased several of the stages that piece of aluminum went through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white HTC Hero had a special Teflon coating that fended off fingerprints and dirt. The Legend doesn?t have that perk, but the aluminum is very good at staving off fingerprints on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other choices of materials we?re not quite so fond of, but we?ll get to that. For now, let?s direct our attention to the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend has a 3.2? HVGA (320 x 480 pixels) touchscreen, which sounds very much like the one on the Hero. But there?s quite a difference however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, it?s an AMOLED screen versus the TFT screen of the Hero. And second, partially because of the newer OS, partially because of the different screen, but the Legend screen can show up to 16M colors (for the Hero that number is just 64K).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting the Hero and the Legend side to side two things are immediately noticeable ? the Hero?s screen is brighter, but the Legend?s screen has darker blacks. This is the usual situation when putting TFT and AMOLED head to head.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also usual is the disappointing sunlight performance ? this time in TFT?s favor. On a sunny day you?d be able to make out most things on the AMOLED screen but under direct sunlight it?s a struggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HVGA is a good enough resolution for a 3.2? screen and the image is crisp. The viewing angles are pretty good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a relatively thin glossy-black bevel around the screen. That bevel is one of the materials we don?t quite like on the Legend. The HTC Hero had a glossy-black bevel too, but that was surrounded by brushed aluminum on which the hardware keys laid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, those keys are made of the same plastic and looks cheap. HTC chose physical, pressable buttons over touch-sensitive ones, which usually have poor feedback (or none at all).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trackball was changed in the opposite direction ? it went from a trackball to an optical trackpad (though HTC call it an optical trackball). It?s flat and unobtrusive and while not as easy to use as an actual trackball, it?s still convenient. But Android can easily be navigated without either of those two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the tour of the front of the HTC Legend, we?ll visit the earpiece at the top center of the device and the nearly invisible proximity and ambient light sensors to its right. You may notice, there?s no sign of a videcall camera. But for all we know, videocalling may as well be out of the reach of Android as a platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Legend are pretty neat. The right side is completely bare (there is no shutter key), and the left houses just the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By comparison, the top is almost crowded with its two elements ? the power/lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack. The bottom, which is plastic rather than aluminum (more on why later) has the microUSB port, the mic pinhole and the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera is on the back accompanied by an LED flash to boost low light performance. The camera doesn't have any lens cover either, so you better keep an eye on it or it will scratch in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera and the flash placed on a strip of black rubbery plastic, which is punctured by little holes ? the holes on the left are for the loudspeaker, while the rest are just decorative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This rubbery plastic appears cheap and isn?t our favorite material, but aluminum can be slippery so this strip and the one on the bottom provide important points of grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom strip of plastic acts as the ?battery cover?. To get to the battery, you slide it down to remove it, and then open a plastic flap. To get the battery out, you put the phone upright and the battery slides out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend packs a pretty large 1300 mAh battery that the manufacturer quotes to last for 440 hours of stand-by or 7 hours of talk time in 2G networks. When using 3G the stand-by should theoretically be up to 560 hours, while talk-time drops to 6 hours and 10 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality the battery life of the HTC Legend is about two days under slightly heavier than average usage. That would include about 20 minutes of talk time over 3G, an hour of browsing through Wi-Fi and about two hours of fiddling with the other apps(most of which require Wi-Fi internet access as well) per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the SIM card and microSD card compartments are just below the battery, which makes pushing the cards all the way in quite a challenge. And you can forget about hot-swapping the microSD card ? chances are the battery will slide out before you manage to reach the microSD card with your nail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is quite a cumbersome solution dictated by the unibody design, but hopefully you won?t have to change cards too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend feels rock-solid in the hand, the back is smooth and comfortable to hold, while the edge around the screen is just sharp enough to remind you it?s made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight adds to the feel of solidity without being too heavy. The chin and the grippy plastic make it comfortable to hold even with a few fingers at the bottom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Sense reloaded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Hero pioneered the Sense UI on to the Android handsets and won a huge fan base. HTC Tattoo was the next Sense-featuring device, but the UI just didn?t feel natural on the QVGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Legend is the successor of the Hero slightly improving the CPU and RAM specs. It packs the latest Android v2.1 taking full advantage of its performance boost and full color capabilities. As result of that the pre-loaded Sense UI is even more pretty, fast and fluid. As we speak, the HTC Hero is about to get an update to ver. 2.1 too ? it should be available in the beginning of April.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main differences between this version of the Sense UI and the one back in the Hero are the new context icons, a few new wallpapers and the unified Widget section. Whether you are using the People, Mail, Music or Gallery Tabs, the scrollable icons at the bottom will please you with new color skins. We welcomed this change, since the old ones looked boring set on the otherwise graphically lively and colorful UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also acknowledge the role of the AMOLED display in making the new Sense UI look even more attractive compared to HTC Hero?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s take a closer look for those who haven?t met the Sense UI yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrow button at the bottom of the screen that used to pull the main menu up is now gone, replaced with three virtual keys and an arched scrollbar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left key launches the main menu. This time around you simply tap to get to it, you can't drag the menu out, though you can drag it back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Add to Home" menu. And there's plenty to add to the homescreen but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen you?re on - it can't be used for actual scrolling. HTC have extended the homescreen to a total of seven desktops instead of the usual three (for Android) and six (for Hero). Even if it sounds too much, with all those widgets (which are quite useful too) it may not even be enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense UI revolves around Scenes, which are essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen - for instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't modify the scenes but if you rearrange the current homescreen you are prompted to save changes as a new scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clean slate scene in turn lets you start from scratch - it's just the default Android setup with a Clock and a few shortcuts underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization - the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes are far from perfect though: the Travel scene has the HTC Footprints widget but nothing on GPS or maps. And as we already mentioned, you can?t edit the default scenes. Your only option is to save a new modified Travel scene under a different name along with the original. Yeah, it sucks, we know!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now back to the other stuff beyond the homescreen and the available Scenes. The changes brought by the Sense UI go deeper than just the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, the main menu has the typical icon grid layout, but you can switch it to a list similar to what you see in TouchFLO in HTC WinMo phones. With it, you can use an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget section has been revamped since the HTC Hero and now both types of widgets (HTC and Android) are placed in one page. There are so many of them that you may find the seven homescreens not enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions - most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget, different look (There are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And some widget styles even offer different functionality. Take the Twitter widget for instance - one version also shows updates for the people you follow, while the other version only lets you tweet from the homescreen. There's nothing stopping you from using both, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC widgets offer a better level of interaction than the stock widgets - there's a Favorites widget that keeps a list of your favorite contacts you can scroll through, no need to get to the contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo album widget is a "stack" of photos that shows all the photos in some folder and you can flick them to view the next photo in line. This is quite fun but the experience is somewhat ruined by optimization - during the animation of the photo going up and the next one settling in, the widget uses low resolution previews of the photos and it takes a couple of seconds for the next image to load up in full quality. Higher-res photos suffer the most from this, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages and Mail widgets work much the same way, but instead of photos, you flick messages. And you don't get the pixilation issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that?s about the part of the Sense UI that?s closes to the surface. There?s more to it but we?ll discuss those bits and pieces throughout the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend UI is generally fast and we must give credit for that to the faster CPU and the optimized software. This time around the UI performance is great - even with lots of files on the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only noticeable slowdown is with widgets that need internet connection to refresh content, but that?s completely normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the HTC Legend compares to its predecessor, the HTC Hero in terms of performance. We used the free Benhcmark and PiBenchmark apps from the Android Market for the test and the results are here for you to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new trackpad is powerful navigation tool, which we enjoyed playing with. Swiping, scrolling and precise selection of elements is easy, but sometimes you swipe your finger over it incidentally. That?s because the hardware keys are very close to the trackpad itself, so be careful there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the trackpad is good thing, we found ourselves barely using it. After all, the excellent screen does perfect job most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two more things - most apps won't run without a microSD card inserted and screen vibration feedback works on the virtual QWERTY keyboard but not elsewhere throughout the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just wait to see what they've done with the phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The dream phonebook is here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Legend features the same powerful phonebook we first saw into Hero. It resembles the one from the HTC TouchFLO but also extend its functionality a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a contact's details presents you with the basic info for the contact - name and photo, numbers, emails and such. What you'd notice though is that there are another five tabs at the bottom and you're just viewing the first tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab holds the SMS messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it held the entire conversation, but for that you?d have to go to the Messages app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact. The next two tabs are quite interesting and can turn the Legend (or in fact any phone running the Sense UI) into a social networking power tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log and "Online directories". The latter holds information for all online profiles of your buddies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact editing screen looks exactly as in the Hero. There's no plus key to add a new detail of a certain type, just a delete detail key. This saves some space (one line per each category) but you have to scroll down to the bottom every time you want to add a new detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot of information you can store per contact as usual, and searching the phonebook is very easy - just press the search button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality in calls is good and the volume is excellent. Reception is quite good as well. The HTC Legend has a proximity sensor for automatically locking the screen when you put your phone to the cheek during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, call log shortcut and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). Smart Dialing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, turn-to-mute also works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the HTC Magic and Hero, the Legend has an interesting feature you'll notice when you make your first call - it vibrates when your call is connected. That's a good way to let you know the other side has picked up if you hold the phone in your hand and not to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you do hold it to your ear - then it's just irritating. It would have been great if it were disabled automatically by a proximity sensor for example. Unfortunately, we didn't find an option to at least switch it off manually either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows the latest dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend such as its predecessor doesn't have voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted our traditional loudspeaker test and here is how the Legend stacks among some other handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich messaging department<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. Google Talk is in charge of instant messaging. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen full QWERTY keyboard in the HTC Legend works in both portrait and landscape modes. The individual button size is decent and sensitivity just fine and we registered no problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like on other Androids, if you have only one SMS message, a line in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and the SMS section is opened once you hit the icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads. Each thread is labeled by the names of the recipients and shows the number of messages in the thread and part of the last message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom, just like with the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 10 or fewer characters remaining to the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating as,the text box only takes a small part of the screen even if you hide the keyboard, which really only gives you little to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. After choosing a name it?s added in a bubble under the main textbox, where you can view or remove it by single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsent messages are marked with a warning sign, but draft messages that used to stay in the thread with a red "Draft" label next to them, are now kept separately in the dedicated Draft section. This makes continuing drafts harder. In the Magic, text in the compose box was kept right there instead of forcing the user to go back to the Drafts folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC and Gmail are your mail clients<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much compared to other Android handsets. There are a few HTC add-ons, but nothing major. Batch operations, which debuted on the HTC Magic, allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interfaces of both the Gmail and Mail apps have been slightly polished with several icons in the menus changed. The extended Gmail features include spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When replying to an email you can opt for either Gmail or the generic mail client, and set one of the two options as default. The reason behind most Android handsets coming with two email clients is the added corporate Exchange ActiveSync support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been slightly tweaked up too.. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the current email account and of course the actual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom there are five virtual buttons that change the inbox view to display conversations, only the emails with attachments, show only the unread mail or display the messages from your VIP mail groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversations view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the standard inbox. The option to only display emails with attached files is a good one to have on hand. Attachments are not automatically loaded by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The chosen filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Legend lacks in terms of email capabilities. What you basically have is a local copy of your Gmail account bundled with its main functionality plus a Microsoft Exchange compatible alternative client, which can manage multiple POP and IMAP accounts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery has pinch zooming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has a the usual main menu list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder - quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the gallery undertakes reindexing of the content each time you open it and it does so even when you open a file for an instant and then get back to the thumbnail view. And that's a bugger as when cards are full of content, it's quite slow to complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a number indicating the count of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has only one shortcut to the settings menu. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons - one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and finally - Flickr. The latter two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anywhere in the gallery except the main Album view you can launch the camera or camcorder to capture new images, share them on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa, and delete the current image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Legend image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip view. You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy and paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you cannot copy/paste images from folder to folder (you'd need a proper file manager for that), you can still share multiple images from your albums on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Legend supports multi-touch and you can take the full advantage of this while browsing your images. Zooming in and out is done in the same fashion as on the Apple iPhone. You can zoom to 100% with simple double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one here is extra smooth - just as it is on the iPhone (and those are 5 megapixel images we're talking about here).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good video player, but no DivX/XviD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed only from the Albums' subfolder as there is no separate icon for the video player in the main menu. The video files can also be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared via Gmail, HTC mail, Messages or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player application of HTC Legend has seen some cosmetic changes, but is still quite basic. The only new addition is the full screen mode, where the original clip is stretched / cropped to fit the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite as expected, the player is capable of playing only 3GP and MP4 videos, which means that you will have to convert most your videos for watching on the go HTC Legend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of MP4 files we threw on the Legend played excellent without any dropped frames or sound lag. We?ve tested up to 640x360 pixels resolution with 30fps videos, which is good enough given the native screen resolution and the 600 MHz processor. In fact the results are quite impressive, compared to the Hero, which wasn?t capable of playing anything more than QVGA@25fps clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is already a player in the Android market that supports DivX and XviD videos. The yxflash player handled well all the files we threw at it although anything above VGA resolution was obviously too much for the hardware. The bad news is that you only get the trial version for free and you after it expires you need to pay 9.9 US dollars for the full app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is all the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As with the rest of the multimedia department, the music player is also the same as in the Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing user interface, though very sleek and more comfortable doesn't offer new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed to find no contextual search in the music player for songs and related stuff in YouTube or Google. The other music player weaknesses of the Android platform still need addressing too - no equalizer presets, nor any alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling between them. It also supports RDS and allows playback through the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend has a slightly better audio output than that of its predecessor, the HTC Hero. The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk may have lost some ground but are still excellent, while the rest of the readings (which weren't quite as impressive on the Hero) have improved greatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frequency response is now spot on for the entire range and distortions have been kept well under control. All in all - a very good overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC Legend relies on a 5 megapixel camera module with a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1936 pixels and a LED flash for its photography needs. This is becoming pretty much the norm for recent upper mid-range and high-end Android handsets so the HTC seems to be on level ground with its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However thanks to running Android 2.1 the Legend also has a camera interface that is similar to some of its competitors outside the Google OS world. There are a number of customizable settings ranging from ISO speed to aspect ratio and auto focus and even if that makes the Omnia HD owners giggle it?s a nice improvement for the Android crew.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see modern-day features such as face, smile and blink detection, for example, but the gap is closing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the usability is still pretty bad with most of the options sitting on a retractable tray at the left side of the viewfinder which can either be dragged out by a finger sweep or by pressing the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a shortcuts for activating the flash and exposure compensation around the viewfinder but that?s pretty much that. The only other shortcut leads to the gallery and that hardly help much with the photography itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the HTC Legend camera is about average. The weather wasn?t too favorable around the office these days but we still expected a better result from it. There's a decent amount of resolved detail but contrast is way too low. Noise is also quite high and you can easily see a pinkish spot in the center of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Legend. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>VGA video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Legend manages to record VGA videos at 30 fps, which is quite good for an Android handset. There are only a couple of devices that do better than that (the HTC Desire and the Google Nexus One) but even they only go as high as D1 and that is just 12.5 percent better).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera and by usual Android standards there are tons of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, encoding type and recording limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as image adjustments are concerned you get exposure compensation, contrast, saturation and sharpness settings as well as color effects and white balances settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto focus is also there for you to enable but the Legend only focuses before the recording starts and acts as a fixed focus camera after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality is pretty decent at the optimum settings with a good amount of resolved detail. The low contrast issues are visible here too and there are some compression artifacts but this is nothing to frown too much about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample VGA@30fps video clip.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity options are plenty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend offers a virtually identical set of connectivity options as its predecessor, the HTC Hero. However even now, nine months later, this seems like a pretty decent package to have on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE securing worldwide roaming capabilities and dual-band (900/2100 MHz) 3G with HSPA. The HSDPA is quoted at 7.2Mbps and the HSUPA can reach up to 2Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We then move on to local connectivity ? the Legend offers USB v2.0 connectivity via a microUSB port, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and Wi-Fi. Now that they?ve enabled Bluetooth transfers, there is very little more to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet tethering is also available via the microUSB port and it?s as easy as it gets to activate. Just select tethering when the handset prompts you to select how to connect to your computer and you are good to go. HTC have also thought of people without a data plan and allow you to explicitly forbid the handset to access mobile network internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we have to mention that the built-in microSD card slot can also be used as a data transfer tool. Card-readers are going for peanuts these days so having one around is quite likely and they give some pretty impressive speeds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The great web browser even packs Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The great web browsing skills have been an incoherent part of the Android platform since day one. Now that we are to version 2.1 things are even sweeter with the intuitive user interface even more polished and the functionality reaching new heights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. With pinch-zooming enabled you don?t even need the +/- zoom buttons that we have seen on most other Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar is locked at the top of the page so you can scroll down and hide that too. However you don?t need to scroll to the top every time you want to tap a new address ? just press the menu button and invoke it anywhere on the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Legend browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which make it extremely easy to read even longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to sweeten the deal even more HTC Legend has Flash support in its web browser. Its performance is hardly spectacular but it?s way better than nothing. You should definitely pick simpler Flash games, but it?s good at least those run just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash video support is also pretty dodgy with the Legend failing to open the Vimeo and Netcafe videos that we tried. YouTube works fine but it uses the preinstalled YouTube application so it doesn?t really count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.1 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but since that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm we won?t be crediting it with extra point because of that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer well prepared, Office document reader preinstalled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend comes with the usual for Sense UI Android handsets set of organizing apps. Much like the Motorola BACKFLIP, which we reviewed last week, it also has a preinstalled document viewer, which handles office files just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again we are talking about the Quickoffice app, which has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For editing, you will need to get the paid app though. There is also a PDF viewer app that handles the PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. The Desk clock app turns your Legend in? well Desk clock ? it displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app allows you to quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the Legend with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance, saving you the trouble to do a web search each time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice recorder might be pretty useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which allows you to modify your profiles on the world?s largest social networks. Not that you couldn?t have downloaded it yourselves but it?s nice that HTC saved you the effort.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation lacks voice-guidance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It was able to achieve satellite lock in just over two minutes without the A-GPS assistance which isn?t too bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and of course makes an appearance on the Legend as well. Its voice-guided navigation version, the Google Maps Navigation is available only in the US, but the rest of the world is in no luck here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out of the preinstalled apps on the HTC Legend, Google Maps is the only one to make use of the built-in digital compass. But if you'd like a real dedicated compass application, you can easily download one from the Android Market for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still plan a route and track your current location so it is better than nothing but you still have to rely on network data for downloading the map info. Unfortunately, the pinch-zooming was unavailable in Google Maps and you will have to live with the on-screen controls and double-tap zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Street View mode is supported in Google Maps and it?s probably the most fun part of Google Maps - it gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where it?s available. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like you?re taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t another preinstalled navigation application, so if you want one, you will have to visit the Android market and pick one yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market knows no slowdown<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Legend comes with a common HVGA display and runs Android 2.1 so the Android Market has quite a lot of stuff to offer for it. With the number of applications growing by the hour and no low-res restrictions, the choice of apps is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all at once, but you will probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and with the most vital ones covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.) the gap to the market-leading AppStore will hardly be felt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, 30000 or so apps is nowhere near what the iPhone users have at their disposal but no one actually installs thousands of apps so you will probably find what you are looking for here too. Besides the Android market is the one with the largest percentage of free apps across all platforms.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Legend has the tough task of filling the shoes of what was considered the best Android handsets. What makes this task even harder is the fact that the Hero lost its top-shelf status just before its successor was announced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire, Google Nexus One and Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 are now battling it out for a spot at the top of the Android food-chain and the HTC Legend has been relegated to the mid-range segment where fierce competition arises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In theory the HTC Legend puts enough new stuff on the table to justify its existence. More RAM, faster CPU, AMOLED screen and aluminum unibody all sound like perfectly good reasons for an upgrade. The Android 2.1 is hardly a factor as the Hero's own Android 2.1 update is just around the corner. We will let you decide for yourselves if the rest of the upgrades are worth the price premium but both devices seem like a decent deal at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are looking to step outside the Sense UI world, you might also want to check out the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica. Admittedly target at a bit younger audience than the Legend it comes at a lower price for a similar package but lacks the shiny aluminum case, which might or might not matter to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it has to be AMOLED then the Samsung I7500 Galaxy is even willing to throw DivX and XviD support to the mix. Again it's not quite the looker but offers a viable alternative to those wanting to save a few bucks but do insist on those deep blacks that only OLED screens can provide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica ? Samsung I7500 Galaxy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Android fans wanting the ultimate performance will have to dig deeper in their pockets and reach for one of the abovementioned trio - HTC Desire, Google Nexus One and Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. The three 1GHz Snapdragon-powered handsets have the speed and plenty of it. Plus you can pick between an 8 megapixel snapper and an AMOLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Desire ? Google Nexus One ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also some HTC Legend alternatives outside the Android world. For about the same kind of cash you can get an unlocked iPhone 3G and sacrifice some hardware power for access to one of the richest mobile AppStores and all the consequent fun. You can also wait a few weeks for the HTC HD Mini and have a taste of the Sense UI running on WinMo 6.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  iPhone 3G ? HTC HD Mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the HTC Legend certainly has a competitor or two for its place under the sun, but it looks well prepared to tackle them. With the Android platform expanding as rapidly as nothing else we have seen before, chances are there will be enough customers out there for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will probably fail to achieve the iconic status of its predecessor, but that is a task given to the HTC Desire. However reaching a similar amount of sales is on the cards, which leads to better support for the owners, which in turns makes the HTC Legend an even better deal.</paragraph>
