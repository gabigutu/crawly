			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has made some of the best-looking smartphones in recent history while Samsung has some of the best-selling ones. That's very much true for the HTC flagship and yet to be seen about the Samsung Galaxy S5, but the clash is no less exciting, being one of design philosophy, in both hardware and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've reviewed both phones individually, now it's time for a head-to-head comparison. We've distilled the specs differences to get you up to speed, but those will hardly tell the whole story. For example, the Galaxy S5 has the bigger battery but the endurance ratings for both phones are nearly identical. Anyway - here's the cheat sheet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One (M8) over Samsung Galaxy S5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera comparison is even more misleading - Samsung's ISOCELL camera has four times as many pixels as HTC's UltraPixel camera. But the difference in pixel size is around three times in favor of HTC. And this is before we account for details like flash, a second camera on the HTC and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year Samsung pulled out all the stops with the Galaxy S5. It goes after Sony with a water-proof body, Sony again with the high-res, large sensor camera, Apple with the fingerprint scanner and rounds it off with a heart rate sensor and Snapdragon 801 chipset. Plus, it's the usual throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach to software - and in TouchWiz a lot of staff sticks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One (M8) is more of an evolution from 2013's HTC One. It improves on the metal unibody design (which is easier said than done), ups the screen size significantly and builds on last year's UltraPixel camera and Zoe with a secondary camera that's there solely to enable new effects. There is one step back here though, the OIS has been dropped but there's a stronger flash to compensate in low-light shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design will be the most difficult difference to quantify, but that's what we'll start with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As aluminum has become the calling card of HTC, so has faux leather for Samsung. HTC kept the basic design unchanged with only a couple of functional changes and a new finish at the rear (one of three options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has made fewer changes, but they are perhaps more recognizable. The back is still made of plastic, but it looks much different than the smooth, glossy plastic of the Galaxy S4 and even different than the faux leather of the Galaxy Note and Tab series. You'll hear differing opinions which plastic is better, but one thing is for sure - the perforated leather looks is associated with the Galaxy S5 and will become instantly recognizable the way red and yellow gets you thinking "McDonalds" subconsciously - instead of thinking green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the front where both phones have changed just a little. The HTC One (M8) looks almost identical with the two metallic speaker grilles, except the capacity keys were moved on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's even less changed on the Galaxy S5 - the key arrangement is the same (capacitive - hardware - capacitive), but the left button was changed from Menu to App switcher. While not visible to the naked eye, the Home button is different too, it doubles as a fingerprint reader (the swipe kind).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slight change in the curvature of the phone's silhouette - the Galaxy S5 is less rounded than the S4, while the HTC went the other way and the M8 is rounder than the previous One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the changes on the back are much more noticeable. The One (M8) has a unique look with two differently sized cameras and dual LED, dual-tone flash. There are three colors at this point: Gunmetal Gray, Glacial Silver, Amber Gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three are aluminum, but the Gray one has a different finish - it looks like brushed metal and has a smooth, polished feel. The other two look and feel like the anodized aluminum of the first one. While we like that HTC gives us options, we didn't quite like the brushed metal version as much since it's so smooth it can feel almost plastic-like at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most noticeable change at the back of the Galaxy S5 is the perforated leather look. The back is made of plastic and is smoother than the Galaxy Note faux leather, but still manages a relatively convincing feel thereof. There's a single LED flash below the camera alongside the heart rate monitor assembly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that while the Galaxy S5 is thinner than the One (M8) - 8.1mm vs. 9.4mm - the Samsung's camera protrudes, while that of the HTC does not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another difference is that the back of Galaxy flagship is removable so you can access the battery. Even so, the phone has an IP67 rating - dust tight and can be submerged in up to a meter of water for half an hour. That scores a couple of important points for Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the two phones are also interesting. The Galaxy S5 does have a microUSB 3.0 port over the microUSB 2.0, which offers faster transfer speeds but is backwards compatible too (so it doesn't cause a shortage of compatible USB cables). The USB port has a flap to protect the sensitive connectors inside from water damage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC didn't change the ports, but instead expanded the metal unibody - on the One (M7) it covered 70% of the back and sides, on the One (M8) that number jumps to 90%. That's because the sides are part of the metal back rather than made of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What HTC did well to change is the newly-added microSD card slot. This is great for people who need lots of storage, but didn't want to buy the pricier 64GB version of the previous One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll talk about (and score) the display and other features (like the speakers) later, but we do have to cover size and in-hand feel before we finish off this chapter. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a slightly bigger screen - 5.1" vs. 5" - but is actually 4.4mm shorter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones measure 142 x 72.5 x 8.1mm for the Galaxy and 146.4 x 70.6 x 9.4 for the HTC. The two loudspeakers and second camera on the back certainly contribute to the extra height of the One (M8). It is narrower than the Galaxy by a couple of millimeters though and the rounded back fits well in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a footprint and screen comparison of the two phones. As you can see, the smaller screen on the One (M8) allows it to be a tad narrower, but the bottom bezel is thicker than the top one (it's where the HTC logo is). Add the two speaker grilles on each side and the Galaxy S5 is shorter, despite its bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 is also 15g lighter - 145g vs. 160g - which tips the scales back in favor of the Samsung. Tall and heavy isn't an ideal combination for a phone and while it isn't by much, the HTC One (M8) is taller and heavier than its opponent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. To break the tie you need to answer a couple of simple questions about your preferences. Design over functionality? Compactness over loudspeaker quality? Will you be using a case? Is water resistance a must?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is undeniably the better-looking phone (which might be void if you use a case) and the feel of real metal tops the feel of fake leather any day. The front-facing stereo speakers are also great, but the move to on-screen buttons didn't do much to reduce the height, though it does eat into usable screen space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 is more practical though with the IP67 rating and user-accessible battery. It's more compact and lighter too. The faux leather is also much better than the glossy plastic of last year, even if it won't win over metal fans.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC made the jump to a 5" screen in this One generation (from 4.7"), while Samsung added only 0.1" to arrive at 5.1". The difference in screen real estate is a mere 4%, really too small to mention. What does make a big impact on usable screen surface area are the buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen buttons of the HTC One (M8) eat up a good portion of the screen, so the actual usable area on the Galaxy S5 is nearly 12% more. In fact, the previous HTC One and its 4.7" screen (but off-screen buttons) has only 5% less usable screen surface than its successor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough talk about size, the screen technology of the two phones is quite different too. HTC uses Super LCD3, while Samsung uses its in-house Super AMOLED. Both have 1080p resolution and nearly the same pixel density - 441ppi and 432ppi - down to the small difference in the diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The few points of pixel density don't affect things as much as the matrix type. The LCD has three sub-pixels per pixel, while the current generation of Super AMOLED uses a diamond arrangement so sub-pixels are not grouped into standard pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Super AMOLED matrix has fewer sub-pixels per inch, which drops its perceived sharpness. At those pixel densities, the differences to the human eye are negligible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What has a bigger impact on screen image quality is contrast, colors and viewing angles. HTC used some of the best LCDs in the business - it's bright, has a high contrast ratio and great viewing angles. The black levels are also quite good for such a bright LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLEDs have perfect contrast and viewing angles, great colors too. Their issue is calibration, but Samsung has finally gotten it perfect - the Galaxy S5 has several screen modes and the Cinema mode gives you the most accurate color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness is another issue AMOLEDs commonly have, but the Galaxy S5 screen does not - it's not quite as bright as the One (M8) LCD, but the difference is pretty small and easily compensated by the lower reflectivity of Samsung's new panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reflectivity is, in fact, a very important consideration. Both phones use Gorilla Glass 3 for protection, but Samsung's screen reflects less light, making it a lot easier to read in direct sunlight. The HTC One (M8) reflects more and that takes its toll on sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's screen also has a high-sensitivity mode that works with gloves and allows the phone to detect your finger hovering over the screen. That's used for the Air View gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Better sunlight legibility is the biggest contributor for the win, but details like more surface area, perfect contrast and colors, the sensitivity start to pile up quick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) certainly has a great display, let down in this head to head comparison mostly by its relatively higher reflectivity.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two competitors are very close in terms of battery capacity - 2,800mAh for the Galaxy S5 vs. 2,600mAh for the One (M8). That's a barely 8% advantage for the Samsung and indeed our endurance ratings are nearly equal, 72 hours and 71 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though AMOLED and LCD are quite different in terms of power consumption, in the individual categories both phones perform nearly identically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For 3G calls, the Samsung Galaxy S5 lasts an hour longer than the HTC One (M8). Still, with both devices toping 20 hours, it's enough that other uses (web browsing, videos, etc.) will drain the battery before calling does.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 also outlasts the One (M8) in browsing, though only by half an hour. Note that at 50% brightness (the setting we use for the test), the Galaxy screen is actually a bit brighter than the One screen (274 nits vs. 245 nits). At equal brightness, the half hour of the Galaxy will extend a bit more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the final round, both phones are virtually equal. Again, the brightness should be considered though here the two front-facing speakers of the HTC One (M8) are more important to the experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With mostly equal performance on the individual test, it should come as no surprise that the overall ratings are almost on par. The Galaxy S5 is slightly less efficient in standby mode, which is what prevents it from scoring higher than it does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that both flagships have power saving modes that are absolutely frugal ? they disable big chunks of functionality, leaving only the basics. This allows you to squeeze several hours out of each remaining battery charge percentage point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 even switches to a black and white screen mode, which is more efficient on an AMOLED. The HTC One (M8) doesn?t have this luxury since the backlight needs to be on regardless of color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. This was very close indeed, the Galaxy S5 never really outlasted he HTC One (M8) by more than an hour. That's still more than nothing and the replaceable battery will be helpful for those who don't mind carrying a spare. In some regions the Galaxy S5 has wireless charging, in others a wireless charging back cover is an optional accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, most people don't have a spare battery and very few use wireless charging. The battery life of the HTC One (M8) by itself is very good ? almost as good as that of the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two flagships run the latest Android version out of the gate (Android 4.4.2 KitKat), but it's the custom skins manufacturers put on Android that are actually more important. They are the ones that bring a lot of the exclusive functionality - think Multi Window or Zoe - while the 4.x releases of Android has been fairly uniform in terms of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz and Sense (the latest versions of each) are quite popular, but just in case you're not familiar with them, here's a quick video refresher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of looks the two are near polar opposites but there's a fairly big cross section of matching features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreens are different enough though. Samsung has been unusually restrained and by default the Galaxy S5 shows nothing more than the time and weather, and a camera shortcut. The fingerprint scanner on the Home key can be used to secure the lockscreen instead of the usual password or pattern protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC on the other hand have added double tap to wake and swipe up to wake and have kept the four shortcuts at the bottom of the screen from the early versions of Sense for Android. From here you can also launch BlinkFeed and Google Now. On the lockscreen you can double tap to lock the phone again, but this doesn't work anywhere else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ease of tap-to-wake is great, in fact we kept tapping other phones too, expecting them to act accordingly. The extra security afforded by the fingerprint scanner will speed things up for the more security conscious (it's quicker than entering a password).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of BlinkFeed, it's a magazine-like interface that shows a stream of news articles, along with updates from both social networks and apps on the device. This means BlinkFeed will show you drawings your kid made in Kid Mode, info from Fitbit workouts and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung recently added a similar feature called My Magazine to the homescreen. This one pulls info purely from web sites and social networks, apps can't post notifications here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Magazines aside, the homescreens are standard with shortcuts, folders and widgets. The app drawers are pretty standard too, except on the Samsung you scroll horizontally, while on the HTC it's vertical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification areas of both phones, however, are quite different. HTC uses the stock Android solution of notifications only with a button to bring up toggles (you can use a two-finger swipe for that too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung shows a row of toggles in the notification area by default, followed by S Finder and Quick connect buttons, then comes a brightness slider (with an Auto check box) and only then the notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might sound too busy, but it all fits quite well on a 5.1" high-res screen. You can hide the brightness slider to free up some room, but not the S Finder and Quick connect buttons. The TouchWiz notification area can also show all toggles and has a larger number thereof overall. This includes things like NFC and Sync that can be quite useful. You can rearrange the toggles to bring the most frequently used ones forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both companies couldn't resist fidgeting with the app switcher UI either. Samsung has stayed close to stock with a vertical list of app thumbnails and icons (the design is slightly different from AOSP) and has added a Task manager and Close all buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC made the bigger change and displays apps in a 3 x 3 grid of app thumbnails. This switcher lets you swipe to dismiss apps, but you can't see the 10th most recent app. There are Task manager and Close all buttons here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Window is a serious multitasking tool exclusive to Samsung's premium line of devices. It allows you to run two apps simultaneously, so you can run two chat sessions at the same time, or a web browser for reference while writing an email or editing a document.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Multi Window is better suited for tablets, it can still be useful on the 5.1" 1080p screen of the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitaskers will get some benefits from Samsung's interface - the easier to access toggles and the ability to run two apps will save you seconds at a time, but those add up quickly over extended use of your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 also has a leg up on the HTC One (M8) in terms of security thanks to its fingerprint scanner and the government-certified KNOX software that handles security on the phone. We already covered the lockscreen, but the Private mode can fingerprint-secure even individual files independently from the unlock routine used. This is great for keeping files private (work or personal files) while someone else is borrowing your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you work for one of the companies that let you bring your own device instead of a dedicated work phone, you'll feel a lot safer knowing private files are locked behind KNOX and a fingerprint scanner. This works equally well for sensitive company files you don't want your friends to just open when borrowing your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones also have dedicated modes for in-car use or for kids to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC is using the free Zoodles app that lets kids play games, draw, read books and even check email, without giving them access to the entire phone functionality. Then there's car mode, which gives you quick access to the music player, navigation, phone and voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a Kids mode too, which uses a custom homescreen with custom apps that have colorful, cartoony interfaces. They keep files separate, i.e. the Kids mode gallery only shows photos taken in Kids mode, not the ones you shot with the default camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The car more is quite similar to HTC's, except it's always listening - you have to say "Hi Galaxy" followed by your command (this feature is powered by S Voice). On the One (M8) you have to tap the Speak button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones have Do not disturb modes (it's called Blocking mode in TouchWiz). They can be scheduled or manually turned on and off, they block notifications and ringers except for messages and calls coming from pre-selected contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones feature extreme power saving modes. They disable most features, including turning off the data connection while the display is off, dimming the screen and showing a stripped down homescreen. They do this in order to last several hours per battery charge percentage point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The extra security and privacy offered by the fingerprint scanner are great and we like having Multi Window even if it won't see too much use for many of the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense 6 on HTC One (M8) is beautiful and matches most of the TouchWiz features, but still has some catching up to do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both flagships are powered by Snapdragon 801 chipsets but, somewhat obscured in Qualcomm's naming convention, the two aren't quite the same. The Samsung Galaxy S5 uses the MSM8974AC variety, while the HTC One (M8) has an MSM8974AB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the base MSM8974 (Snapdragon 800) and those two are that the Adreno 330 GPU is clocked at 578MHz, up from 450MHz. The CPU is still a quad-core Krait 400, but the AC version (the one in the Galaxy S5) goes a step further and bumps the original clockspeed up from 2.3GHz to 2.5GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind those rates aren't locked, that is the software can change them depending on the performance mode. For example, the battery saving modes cap the clockspeeds at lower values, while a certain infamous setting pushes them higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're talking, of course, about benchmark cheating. Samsung used to do it, but disabled the "feature" on all its Android 4.4 software. HTC does it on the One (M8) and claims it's a feature that can be used for more than benchmarks. We still doubt its usefulness - if the chipset gets hot, as flagship chipsets do, it will throttle itself, so this over the top performance will be short-lived.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have anti-cheat versions of two Basemark tests (OS and X) to try and see what kind of difference it makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's start with the basics. CPU benchmarks randomly place the Galaxy S5 behind and ahead of Snapdragon 800 devices from last year. The HTC One (M8) lags behind them for the most part, by quite a bit in Geekbench 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran Basemark OS - the regular version and a modified anti-cheat APK - and found out that the CPU score differs 12% and 17% respectively for single and multi-core performance on the HTC One (M8). This means the Geekbench is closer to reality than Benchmark Pi and Linpack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS (CPU multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We go to AnTuTu 4 and Quadrant for an overall look at performance. Here both flagships are pretty evenly matched, but again the One (M8) temporarily boosts performance for a short period of time (just enough to run a benchmark).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to 3D benchmarks it should be noted that both phones have 1080p screens, but the HTC One (M8) reserves a sliver of that for the on-screen buttons. This should give it a small advantage in on-screen tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, we see that the off-screen performance is quite close between the two (as can be expected, given the identical GPUs), except the One (M8) gets a minor bump going from offscreen to on-screen in both GFX benchmarks (2.7 and 3.0).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, both phones top the charts as can be expected from Adreno 330 at a higher clockspeed than last year's models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it comes as a slight surprise when the Galaxy S5 lags 5fps behind the HTC One (M8) in Epic Citadel. The difference is too big to explain with just on-screen buttons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we tried Basemark X using an untouched APK and a modified one to dodge benchmark detection. The HTC One (M8) beat the Galaxy S5 running both versions, but each phone shows no difference in performance on either version of Basemark X. This means that the M8 benchmark cheating is limited to CPU overclocking.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung customizes the stock Android browser and one of the things it changes is the JavaScript engine. That's immediately obvious in the SunSpider 1.0.2 scores where the Galaxy S5 is the fastest phone we've tested. The HTC One (M8) is noticeably slower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2 tests web page rendering performance as well as JavaScript. Here both phones did excellently with the Galaxy S5 having a small lead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider 1.0.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two flagships are quite close in terms of performance. The Samsung Galaxy S5 can be expected to go faster where CPU is concerned, especially in multi-core scenarios (e.g. using two apps simultaneously). The faster CPU and perhaps some software tweaks helped the Galaxy S5 pull ahead in web browsing performance too. 3D games shouldn't show much of a difference between the two phones, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Having a bit more CPU oomph, which in turned boosted web performance, give this victory to the S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a narrow victory as the One (M8) held its own in 3D gaming and is still one of the fastest phones around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>App package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones come with a complete Office package courtesy of Polaris Office 5. It handles viewing and editing of Office documents and PDF files with a comprehensive feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung and HTC have provided their own custom apps for the gallery, music and video players. HTC's player is no longer Beats branded, a BoomSound setting has taken its place. It can only be turned off and on (only when headphones are plugged in), but there's no equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's music player has SoundAlive presets and a manual equalizer too. It can automatically adjust the equalizer with the Adapt Sound feature and level out differences in volume between tracks with Smart volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both players support FLAC audio (both 16 and 24 bit), and each phone has a microSD card slot since you'll need the extra storage for FLAC or DLNA. Album art and artist info can be automatically downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the Audio quality section to see if the two phones have quality audio processing hardware to make FLAC really count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One (M8) certainly has a big advantage when playing music on the loudspeakers. It won't let you tune the player to your liking but another player from the app store will open that door for those who want it. We'll see in the next chapter whether the Galaxy S5 can score back any points with headphones plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) has an FM radio with RDS if you want to listen to local broadcast stations for news or music. The Galaxy S phones haven't had FM radio for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe is now a standalone app in Sense 6. It lets you manually select the photos and videos that will be compiled into a Highlights video, also choose a theme and sound track for them. Better yet, Zoe is now a social experience - you can collaborate with friends and share multimedia to create a combined Highlights video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app on the HTC One (M8) shows a timeline of your photos by default. They can be grouped by Event, Day, Month or Year. Alternative views are Albums and Location. There's an option that automatically searches the gallery for images similar to the current one, which works pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Gallery app tops that by scanning photos for people, pets, vehicles, flowers, food, scenery or documents and grouping them accordingly. It's an impressive feature, and quite accurate too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have custom video players and but codec support is patchy. The popular MKV and MP4 formats with H.264 works but audio is limited to MP3 and AAC. Neither handled DTS, Dolby or AC3 sound. Worse still, the phones had issues with DivX, even XviD was hit or miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 does have extensive subtitle support, which is a must-have for non-English speakers. It also has the audio options from the music player. The HTC One (M8) carries over its own advantage - the front-facing speakers let you better appreciate movie audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two flagships feature IR blasters allowing them to control a TV, cable box and a AV receiver. The respective apps will ask you where you live and who your service providers are so you can browse the TV schedule and pick out what to watch, set reminders and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One (M8) has a couple of nice tricks here. It can be set to automatically wake up when you pick it up, so changing the channel feels more like using a physical remote (no unlocking). The phone can also learn signals from existing remotes so if a button doesn't do what it should or you're using a device not in the extensive database you can teach the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 cannot learn new signals (it only has an IR emitter, not a receiver), but it does have a more extensive library of signals built in, allowing it to control disc players, streaming players and even air conditioners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Couch potatoes will enjoy controlling their HTPC setups, but they can get some exercise with either of the two phones as well. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has the feature-rich S Health app, which other than the phone itself, can work with a Gear smartwatch or one of several third-party trackers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can use the phone's heart rate sensor for instantaneous readings or you can use a Gear smartwatch or dedicated heart rate sensor. These readings make the calorie tracker much more accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) comes with the free Fitbit app, which is designed to use Fitbit's trackers (and only them). If you don't have one, the app can rely just on the phone's sensors. The Fitbit range includes a scale to automatically upload your weight, but you can input those values manually. S Health can use wireless scales too, but it supports a couple of brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For weight watching, both apps let you keep track of your diet, calculating calorie intake and burn rate. The Fitbit app can also track how much water you drink, which is also important for weight loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering you can download Fitbit's app on any phone and that it works much better with one of Fitbit's devices, HTC's contribution here isn't much. Samsung's custom S Health app on the other hand is exclusive and one of the most feature-rich we've seen. It supports third party devices and the heart rate readings make it more suitable for serious exercise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC traditionally has an option to copy contacts and messages from your old phone, which facilitates the switch to your new One (M8). If you're upgrading from an Android phone, Google will take care of that by syncing seamlessly, but in case you're trading in an iPhone this app can save you some hassle. That's only if you haven't synced your iPhone with Google's services though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The HTC One (M8) has certain hardware advantages, which help it in the media player department, but Samsung's app package is richer out of the box. The S Health app is amazing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) has an FM radio for those who still haven't made the switch to Internet streaming. You might be switching its music and video players because they lack some needed features and the Fitbit app is non-exclusive, which hurt HTC's case here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It terms of absolute loudness, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a slight advantage over the HTC One (M8). This makes hearing the phone ringing a little easier, but that's only if you place it face down so that the loudspeaker at the back is facing open air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing speakers of the One (M8) can't get muffled when you put the phone face down. As we've already mentioned, the speakers also make listening to music and watching videos without headphones a far more pleasurable experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's because they sound better than the single speaker on the Galaxy S5 and quality is more important for music than absolute loudness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). HTC puts great emphasis on the speakers and it comes as no surprise they perform great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 isn't that much louder than the HTC and, due to speaker placement, its loudspeaker isn't better at notifying you for incoming calls and messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One (M8) both showed splendidly clean audio output in our tests. The two smartphones put in flawless performances when connected to an active external amplifier and very little degradation when we plugged in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only notable difference in terms of purity is the slightly better quality of the stereo that the HTC One (M8) produces with headphones. However, a somewhat easier to spot advantage of the HTC smartphone is the loudness of its output, which blows all other handsets we've tested out of the water.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>  HTC One (M8) frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). With quality audio hardware, the HTC flagship manages excellent headphone output too. The clarity might be only a tad better on the One (M8), but combined with the far louder output it's enough to make it the definitive winner here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC made a controversial decision last year to abandon the megapixel race and aim at technical superiority rather than marketing. This year the company made an even more unexpected step by keeping the same sensor (but dropping the optical image stabilization) and introducing a second camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get back to what it's for in a moment, let's first list the camera basics. The HTC One (M8) has a 1/3" sensor with 4MP resolution (it's now at least a year old), f/2.0 aperture and a dual-LED flash. It's a two-tone flash dubbed Smart Flash, which is brighter and should produce more accurate white balance in photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 uses a brand new sensor called ISOCELL, developed by Samsung itself. It's big too - 1/2.6", almost as big as Nokia's 1/2.5" sensors (Lumia 1520, Icon and 930). It's a 16:9 widescreen sensor with 16MP resolution behind an f/2.2 aperture. Samsung claims ISOCELL improves dynamic range in good lighting conditions and reduces noise in poor light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Samsung and HTC have enabled a number of special features for their respective flagships (and as usual, Samsung threw in the kitchen sink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headlining feature of the One (M8) and the reason behind its dual-camera setup is the ability to do depth calculations. This enables effects like shallow depth of field (characteristic of a DSLR with a large sensor) and effects that make the foreground objects pop (with an effect applied to the background, i.e. a sketch, a blur or one of several other options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a depth of field effect too, but it's more limited. The Galaxy S5 takes two photos instead of just one (but is quick doing it, so it doesn't get in the way of your shooting much) and uses them for calculations. You can only focus on the foreground, background or bring everything into focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) on the other hand can apply the effect to any photo you've taken and it can refocus on any point of the image. Better yet, the resulting depth of field is much shallower than what the Galaxy S5 achieves. With selective focus, the rule of thumb is the shallower, the better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, HTC's second camera only removes the need to snap a second photo but doesn't do much for accuracy. Both phones mess up the calculations in places and with HTC pushing the effect strength higher, the places where the calculations are wrong are more obvious than in Galaxy S5 photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the Galaxy seems to make fewer mistakes, there are a few places where the background blur in the One (M8) photos cuts off unexpectedly with an in-focus area becoming quite noticeable in a sea of blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, the second camera of the HTC One (M8) means the phone only needs to take one photo, making it suitable for applying this refocus effect to moving objects. A fast moving object will be a problem for the Galaxy S5, but for static objects it produces the better-looking images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC also put a 5MP camera on the front - that's right, the front-facing camera has a higher resolution than the main camera. Still, that's great news for people who take a lot of selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's other premium feature on the One (M8) camera is the return of Zoe. Zoe snaps short videos alongside still photos and later assembles them into Highlights - short slideshows of photos and videos you've taken at a certain place on a given day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its initial incarnation, Zoe now lets you control the length of these videos (it used to be fixed at 3s). As we mentioned in the previous chapter, you can collaborate with friends to create a combined Zoe too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Samsung doesn't have a direct answer to Zoe, it does have Virtual tours. They are similar to panoramas, except you don't have to stay in one place - you can move around relatively freely, stopping every couple of steps to take as many photos as you like and move on. The Galaxy S5 will stitch them into a video-like presentation, complete with a minimap that tracks your movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Samsung put a wider array of features on its new flagship, covering most of what the HTC One (M8) can do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe is nice but can't carry the M8 alone and despite having a whole second camera to help it the shallow depth of focus feature is not clearly better than Samsung's. It will work better for moving objects, but other than that the Galaxy S5 results looked cleaner.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Comparing the image quality of the two cameras will be quite difficult due to the massive resolution difference. The Samsung Galaxy S5 camera has 16MP still resolution, while the HTC One (M8) has only a quarter of that -4MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This raises the question how do we compare the two - comparing them at native resolutions is difficult because the scale of objects is quite different. Objects in Galaxy S5 photos appear over 4 times larger than the same objects in HTC One (M8) photos ("over" because of a different field of view, more on that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what that looks like:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some things become quickly apparent - the One (M8) has issues with shadows. Noise levels also appear to be higher in the HTC shots, but the Samsung goes a bit too far with the sharpening, which makes noise in its photos more apparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's move on to a different comparison - if you're going to share photos on Facebook, 4MP is the upper bound of photo. One (M8) photos have just a bit more resolution than a QHD screen (2,560 x 1,440), which is becoming popular with laptops. Then there are large desktop monitors and even 13" 3,200 x 1,800 laptops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping these resolutions in mind, the Galaxy S5 leaves you plenty of room to crop a photo, while the One (M8) needs every pixel it has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We downscaled a Galaxy S5 photo to match the HTC camera's resolution. The tendency of the One (M8) to underexpose photos is apparent here too, as is the lack of resolution. The wider field of view acts against the HTC, but still everything looks a lot softer due to noise, while the Galaxy S5 gets to discard some of the noise in the downscale process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are close to accurate, though both phones oversaturate them, the Galaxy more than the One. The Galaxy S5 has the most accurate screen in terms of color rendering, but the camera ruins this balance somewhat. That said, the HTC One (M8) didn't hit the mark when it comes to white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've mentioned that HTC's camera underexposes photos a few times now, let's have a look at that. The weather wasn't quite perfect when we took the photos, it was overcast. The crop below shows how each phone captured the bright, cloud-covered sky and a part of a building that was in the shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) captures more of the clouds, but leaves the shadows much too dark. Part of that is poor metering - the software decided to focus on the sky rather than the shadowy areas on the ground. HTC could rework this to achieve better results, but the One (M8) sensor has worse dynamic range, which can't be helped by software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our crops, we have a third, final direction to go - upscaling HTC One (M8)'s 4MP shots to match the Galaxy S5's resolution. Not that you would be upscaling photos, but this makes the difference in captured detail all the more obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Trained eyes will quickly spot the oversharpening halos in photos taken with the Galaxy S5, but they are not too bad and you're unlikely to be viewing those in full resolution (unless you cropped most of the photo out). The HTC One (M8)'s camera just doesn't have the raw resolution to compete in broad daylight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One way to fix the issue in the shadows of the HTC One (M8) is to enable the HDR mode. The Galaxy S5 has a slightly wider dynamic range to begin with and Samsung has had one of the best HDR modes of recent phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTD One (M8) barely does anything to highlights (which in this contra jour shot was quite necessary) and brings out a lot more in the shadows. If parts of your shot appear too dark (as will be common with the One (M8)), you can switch to HDR, it will help. That said, it drops the contrast of the photo too much, which we don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's approach is more balanced and the phone develops a little extra detail in both highlights and shadows, without dropping the contrast too low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested one more feature of the two phones in daylight, the panorama. As can be expected, the Galaxy S5 panorama has more resolution, but the wider dynamic range and better exposure algorithms of the Samsung also make a big difference. HTC's color balance seems off once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that both phones will take 360° photos, we only shot around 180°.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The HTC One last year had troubles competing in good light with 2013's flagships, a 2014 flagship camera blows it out of the water and the One (M8) has a very marginally improved camera (sans OIS, which makes no difference here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weather wasn't the best, but photos from the One (M8) were so dark they were, at times, unusable. HTC could resolve this and some of our complaints with a software update, but the hardware just isn't up to par.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Video image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The choice of a lower resolution sensor works against HTC in video capture too. Last year a 4MP sensor was acceptable for video capture, but flagships now record 2160p video, which is equivalent to 8MP. HTC's sensor is only 1520px tall, while 2160p video (as the name suggests) requires 2160px vertically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Penetration of 4K TVs is still relatively low, but is set to explode in the next couple of years. Having more pixels on the sensor to render 1080p video should also be advantageous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 does indeed provide a much sharper video than the HTC One (M8) at 1080p. Switching to 2160p makes the difference in resolved detail overwhelming. One (M8)'s lower dynamic range also affects the image quality and, colors don't look great either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We looked at the encoding parameters of both videos for a potential explanation of the difference in image quality. It turned out that the HTC One (M8) uses a higher bitrate (nearly 20Mbps) than the Galaxy S5 (17Mbps). Both videos used the same encoding options (AVC High@L4.0, 1 reference frame).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC does use higher audio bitrate, 192Kbps, versus 128Kbps for the Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For 2160p video, the Galaxy S5 jumps to 47Mbps, which means the same length video takes up nearly three times as much internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones can shoot 60fps video at 1080p resolution. That's a lot more accessible - while you can't share them on YouTube, 1080p @ 60fps videos will play just fine on your current HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 bumps up the used bitrate to 28Mbps, more than doubling it to handle twice the framerate. The HTC One (M8) bitrate remained unchanged, meaning each frame has to be encoded in half the space. Despite that, the apparent video quality doesn't seem to degrade much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Galaxy S5 videos look sharper, similar to the 1080p @ 30fps videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the still cameras, the video cameras of both phones can record HDR video. Note: we used 1080p mode on both phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inherently wider dynamic range of the Galaxy S5 makes a difference while the mode is off and it surely helps when we switch it on. The phone brought out more detail in the shadows, but left the highlights untouched. The colors become too oversaturated for our liking though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) manages its colors better, but HDR mode has a noticeable detrimental effect on the image quality. Jaggies appear, which indicate the internal processing might be done at less than 1080p. It's not done at 30fps either, HDR videos came out with 28fps framerate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Worse still, the extra detail in the shadows comes at the price of a lot of noise, while the highlights remain as burned out as with HDR off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In short, both phones have their woes but enabling HDR mode on the Galaxy S5 does more good than bad (if you can live with the colors). The jaggies and noise the One (M8)'s HDR mode introduces, plus its inability to fix highlights make it more trouble than it's worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The 2160p mode alone might have been enough for the Galaxy S5 to win, but this test showed the HTC One (M8) lags behind in 1080p mode as well. The 60fps and HDR tests also went in favor of the Galaxy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera image quality: low light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC's saving grace last year was good low-light, but this year Samsung has a new sensor, which is not only larger but also has design that promises improved low-light performance. Big pixels are just one way to improve low-light performance, smaller pixels on a better sensor is another - those are the two approaches taken by HTC and Samsung, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC left the sensor design unchanged and removed the optical image stabilization, which allowed the phone to do longer exposure times. The company did add a dual LED, dual-tone flash, which should be brighter and offer better color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shots were taken with the phone in the hand, where an OIS-enabled camera would have had an advantage, but neither the Galaxy S5 nor the HTC One (M8) have that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For these crops, we downscaled the photos of the Galaxy S5 to 4MP. Its higher resolution once again allowed it to capture more detail than the HTC One (M8). The white balance leans a little towards red, but the HTC's white balance isn't spot on either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the exact same lighting setup, we recorded two short videos with each phone - with the flash tuned off and with the flash turned on. The videos were shot from the hand and we used 1080p for the Galaxy S5, again because it's better to go with the lower resolution when there isn't enough light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the distance we shot our object (about 5 feet), the flash made little difference. You can notice a slight increase in contrast, but that's about it. HTC's dual-tone flash once again fails to provide an accurate white balance. The Galaxy S5 was off the mark too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fine detail starts leveling off, though the Galaxy S5 retains a small advantage. It also provided the brighter videos, though the contrast wasn't as good as on the HTC. The One (M8) videos were quite dark but they did have a bit more detail thanks to the contrast and the stronger sharpening (which is also more noticeable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The HTC One (M8) started closing the gap here, but its sensor is over a year old now and it doesn't cut it anymore. Samsung's ISOCELL sensor performed rather well, while HTC's dual-tone camera didn't do much to improve color accuracy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung and HTC each have their encampment of fans and given each phone's similarity to its predecessor, we think a lot of them will be upgrading to the 2014 flagships if they decide to leave their current phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those only now coming to the game will have a far tougher decision to make in picking between the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the HTC One (M8). The two phones have a lot of similar functions, but they overlap less than it may appear at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has deservedly received a lot of accolades for its metal unibody and this year the company delivers yet again. The One's other strengths, the speakers and top-notch audio hardware, are present in the 2014 (M8) model too. Fans of design and music alike will lean towards the One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera may have been a misstep, however. The 5MP front-facing camera is great for selfies and the artistic effects enabled by the second camera will be popular with the Instagram crowd, but for general performance we should have seen a lot more from a 2014 flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where the Samsung Galaxy S5 steps in. Even detractors of plastic have to admit its look and feel have vastly improved over the Galaxy S4. The camera is a noted improvement over the predecessor too and more importantly it beats the HTC One (M8) camera hands down for stills, video and most effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has also made a big step in perfecting the Super AMOLED technology and the Galaxy S5's screen is power-efficient, with great image quality and excellent sunlight legibility. It also offers you the choice between perfectly accurate colors and typical AMOLED punchiness - something beyond the LCD capabilities. In the great outdoors the S5 has another advantage - an IP67 rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we doubt most people will push the IP rating to its full "one meter under water" potential, they won't be jealous of their Xperia-toting friends snapping photos by or into the pool (HTC owners might, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is not up to par, but with headphones plugged in, the Samsung flagship is not that far back in terms of audio quality. It also tends to offer a richer app package out of the box, including exclusives like the wonderful S Health app and features enabled by the fingerprint scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People who have retired their point-and-shoot will prefer the Galaxy S5 camera by a wide margin and would appreciate getting the equivalent of a waterproof camera. Photographers will get to view their shots (made with the S5 or not) on the sharp, accurate screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Waterproofing, fingerprint and heart rate scanners are rare or even unique. The cumulative effect of all those changes make the Galaxy S5 feel like a proper upgrade over a 2013 phone, while the HTC One (M8) is less convincing in that regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But while the Samsung Galaxy S5 came out on top in terms of number of victories that only makes it the definitive winner for some of you. The metal body and no-headphones sound of the HTC One (M8), plus its social networking-friendly camera are enough of an advantage for those that don't rely on numbers alone when picking their next handset.</paragraph>
