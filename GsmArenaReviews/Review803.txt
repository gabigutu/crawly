			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 and Oppo Find 7 are the most recent embodiment of the latest and greatest that smartphones can offer, being the first (and still only) two devices that sport QHD screens. Whether or not a resolution of 2560 x 1440px on a 5.5-inch display is overkill or even necessary is beyond the scope of this shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking at either of these devices it's because you want the latest cutting edge technology that can be found in a smartphone. Whether or not that technology is capable of providing a robust smartphone experience, however, is a different question altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones continue to represent the crest of each coming modern technological wave, garnering the best out of companies seeking to be rewarded through market share and huge profit margins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In both of our comprehensive reviews of these devices, it became obvious that having to power additional pixels takes quite a bit of extra juice. Even though both devices sport hefty 3,000mAh batteries, each reflected relatively poor battery life while the screen was on. But battery life isn't everything - let's take a look at how the two devices fare against one another.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo Find 7 over G3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the race to higher screen fidelity required its fair share of sacrifices, the LG G3 and Oppo Find 7 don't just have a pretty picture going for them. The G3 is one of the more refined designs we've seen in a while, with LG being able to fit in a 5.5-inch diagonal in the almost same footprint as many rival 5-inchers, and with a low weight to boot. Oppo has loaded the Find 7 with enough firepower under the hood to top out our benchmark charts, beating out the likes Samsung and Sony in many of our tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately, both devices offer compelling packages, each boosted by the addition of the QHD display. Both give current flagships a run for their money in different ways, and not just when it comes to screen fidelity. The only question is, which is the better of the two? Let's find out!</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to design, both smartphones offer differing approaches. LG aimed to minimize the impact of bringing in a larger and higher resolution display, and were able to fit it in a 5.5-inch screen just barely larger than the footprint of the 5-inch LG G2. The Find 7 relies on a pleasantly-textured back panel to help you grip its markedly larger and heavier device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones rely on polycarbonate as their primary construction material, although the G3 gets kudos for its faux-aluminum finish and solid construction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo takes a more standard design approach with the Find 7, and relies on capacitive buttons below the display rather than part of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While looks are certainly a key feature of a smartphone (it's always in your hand or on ear), there are more things to consider before declaring a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, the LG G3 is significantly more compact and lighter. The exact measurements are 146.3 x 74.6 x 8.9mm and 149g, while the Find 7 comes in at 152.6 x 75 x 9.2mm and 171g. The weight difference is certainly noticeable between the two, and the added 6mm in vertical also makes the Find 7 feel much larger in-hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arguably the most important measurement here is width where both phones are fairly close. The width of the G3 is on par with that of the larger device, and in terms of usability is not ideal, as your thumb has a long way to travel in one-handed operation. Oddly, the shorter vertical plays against the G3 in this case, as it makes the device feel too wide in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither of the first generation QHD devices has an IP certification against dust and water ingress, so it can't be said that one device has an advantage over the other in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the G2, LG has moved its physical buttons from below the screen to the display itself, while the power/lock and volume rocker are located below the camera lens on the back as part of the company's proprietary control deck. It's been refined since its initial implementation and both the volume rocker and power/lock button feature pleasant textures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo takes the more conventional approach of placing its physical buttons on both sides of the device, while retaining its capacitive buttons below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The illumination of the Back, Home, and Menu keys on the Oppo is extremely low, which makes it hard for first time users as you simply can't see what button you're pressing. The G3 relies on on-screen buttons for the same purpose, with varying transparency so as not to obstruct the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices have their USB ports on the bottom next to the primary microphone. The G3 also has its 3.5mm audio jack here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices feature speakers located on the back, rather that front-facing ones like on some of their competitors. The Find 7 has a small nub to keep the speaker from getting completely muffled by the surface it's resting on, while the G3's curved rear panel accomplishes the same task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP cameras of the two devices are flush with the back, so you don't get the wobble you would on devices with protruding camera modules. The lens on the G3 is more indented than that of the Find 7 to prevent scratching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panels of both devices are removable, revealing user-replaceable batteries underneath. Both smartphones have 3,000mAh units, with the panel on the G3 being slightly easier to remove than that of the Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. While both devices are made of polycarbonate, the LG G3 is the better looker thanks to its curved back and faux-aluminum texture. While it's slightly too wide for one-handed operation, the fact that LG was able to fit in the same 5.5-inch display into a significantly smaller frame than the Find 7 is quite an accomplishment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's where we'll be answering the question that's on everyone's mind: which of these QHD displays is the better one? As both match each other in resolved detail, we'll be discussing more in-depth the other aspects that factor in to a capable display: contrast, colors, viewing angles, and sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are reports of Find 7 displays with spotty color calibration issues, but we could not detect any such issues with our particular model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we mentioned, both phones offer 5.5-inch displays of 1440 x 2560px resolution, which results in a pixel density of around 534 ppi. LG's screen is of the True HD-IPS+ variety, while the Find 7 panel is marketed as simply IPS. While the LG display certainly sounds better, we won't be going on titles alone and will instead let the numbers speak for themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how each of them look under our digital microscope at 800x magnification:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen contrast on the Find 7 is very good. It has slightly higher black luminance at 50% brightness, but the contrast ratio is far superior to the numbers provided by the LG G3. The Find 7 is not too far behind the majority of 1080p flagships like the HTC One (M8) and Sony Xperia Z2, while the LG G3 is the poorest we've seen in this generation of flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are more even when it comes to sunlight legibility, but unfortunately not on a good way. The Oppo Find 7 and LG G3 are among the more reflective screens we've tested recently, scoring significantly behind the other recent flagships. The Find 7 sports a factory-installed screen protector, that when removed should result in better figures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Oppo Find 7. Screen fidelity being the same, it really comes down to which of the two displays proves superior in contrast, sunlight legibility, viewing angles and colors. In all of these areas (save for sunlight legibility), the Find 7 clearly trumps the LG G3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones are powered by Qualcomm chipsets and enjoy all the connectivity benefits that come included. The European variant of the LG G3 beats out the Find 7 in the number of supported LTE bands, though both should have you well covered for whatever region you buy the device in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wireless connectivity on the LG G3 is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, which also supports a/b/g/n as well. Meanwhile, the Find 7 relies simply on b/g/n connectivity. Bluetooth 4.0 is available for connecting accessories, although the G3 has the advantage of supporting LE (low energy) peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support USB On-the-go capabilities for their USB 2.0 ports, but that's where the similarities end. The LG G3 has and IR-port for controlling televisions, air conditioners, and more, as well as an FM radio antenna (on the European model only).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. Although offering largely the same connectivity suite, the G3's IR-port, FM radio, and WiFi ac-support are enough to give it the edge over the Find 7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Battery life is one area where we've found both devices have struggled with, despite each sporting 3,000mAh units that would normally be enough to adequately power most flagships. But then again, most flagships don't have QHD displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is able to achieve an endurance rating of 69 hours, while the Oppo Find 7 scores at 44 hours. Here's how each device breaks down in the individual categories:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to performance without the screen turned on - like 3G calling - both devices post good numbers. The LG G3 comes in at right around the 25 hour mark, while the Find 7 was at right around the 20 hour mark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing was one area where both devices struggled significantly, with the Find 7 struggling to reach the 5 hour mark, while the G3 did marginally better at 6:40 hours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is another area where the G3 is able to pull ahead of the Find 7. Its near 10 hours of video watching is still behind most current 1080p flagships, but the much better than the measly 5 hours posted by the Oppo Find 7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, the LG G3 will last you longer than the Oppo Find 7 in an identical use pattern, although if you tend to do a lot of web browsing the G3 will not offer stellar performance either. It's obvious that current QHD display tech requires some serious juice to keep them lit up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth mentioning here that Oppo has included a 4.5Amp fast-charging adapter, that's rated to quickly charge the Find 7 up to 75% in just 30 minutes. While it doesn't make up for the relatively poor battery endurance of the Find 7, it's a small solace to know that you'll at least be able to somewhat make up for it with fast charging capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile, LG's rear panel comes with built-in wireless charging capabilities, meaning that you could take advantage of LG's wireless charging stand accessory without the need for a special back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. Although the poor web browsing performance isn't something to be proud of, the G3 was still able to outshine the Oppo Find 7 in every other category, including superior standby numbers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interfaces<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the user interface on Android, different manufacturers take the time to add a fair dose of visual flair and functionality. In the case of LG and Oppo, the Korean manufacturer can be seen as following the more standard approach in its Android 4.4 KitKat build with Optimus overlay, while Oppo's ColorOS UI on top of Android 4.3 is slightly more unconventional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you a better idea of what we mean, here are two short videos showing off both interfaces:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Color OS lockscreen is almost identical to the stock Android one. There's an unlock ring, which you slide to get to the homescreen. You can have widgets on the lockscreen, which are located to the left of the main window, while on the right there's a camera shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG lockscreen features the company's proprietary Knock Code feature, which lets you get straight into the lockscreen via a series of taps on certain places on the screen - even when the screen is off. Otherwise, the other standard unlock methods as well as lockscreen widgets and shortcuts are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Past the lockscreen, you'll find Oppo's Exclusive homescreen panes. Currently, there are two available - Photo and Music. Photo space takes up a whole homescreen and features a live viewfinder so you can take shots straight from your homescreen plus a shortcut to the full camera app. Below you get a timeline with all your recent photos and you can share them very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second Exclusive space homescreen pane is Music. It features a cool, if slightly intuitive design with a vinyl for changing the currently playing song and stopping/resuming playback. You can change songs, go directly to the music player or the Phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the LG G3 is reserved for the so-called Smart Bulletin, which is a special space similar Samsung's My Magazine (except not as robust). Smart Bulletin posts at-a-glance info from LG's Health app and Smart tips that highlight aspects of the phone's technology and usage, but nothing else beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Find 7, the notification area will show one row of quick toggles, a brightness slider and a shortcut for enabling auto brightness mode, the current notifications plus a shortcut to go into settings. If you do a drag gesture from the quick toggles row you get two more lines of toggles. There's also a Kill all apps button there. At the bottom of the notification area sits a clear button to remove all your notifications at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's notification area is more customizable. You can remove the brightness and volume sliders, or any of the toggles in the topmost row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 includes a special Guest mode that only gives access to apps that you've pre-selected, so you can share your phone without worrying about private data or settings getting messed with. In order to use Guest Mode you'll need to set up a pattern or password unlock for regular access and a seperate one for Guest Mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG provides its own Guest mode feature, which is virtually the same thing. It lets you pick which apps the guest has access to, including a custom Guest gallery of photos and videos, while restricting access to the settings or multitasking features of the G3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For multitasking, LG pushes its Dual window feature that puts two apps side by side. You can copy and paste text between them or snap a screenshot in one and use it in the other. Apps that go well together can be grouped into a single shortcut for added convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Find 7 doesn't have Dual window, it does have a special Gesture panel. You access it just like you would open your notification area, but you need to start your swipe in the left quarter of the bar at the top, just as if you were pulling down the notification area. You can perform various gestures in the Gesture panel to open different apps. For instance drawing a circle would open the camera app, but you can assign any apps to any gestures you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo's Color OS supports themes, one of which changes the appearance and functionality of Color OS to match that of stock Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. There are also several nifty visual flair effects, such as changing the wallpaper with live or static ones and change the scrolling effect of the homescreens. There's one more option - Live Weather - it can flicker snow, rain, dandelions, etc. over the screen. The effect is very impressive, like snow piling up on your dock icons and the bottom of your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Each interface offers features that the other lacks, such as LG's Dual window feature and Oppo's Exclusive spaces. It ultimately comes down to whether you'll prefer the more stock approach that Oppo takes while adding some visual flair with its ColorOS, or if the feature-ridden KitKat optimizations with Optimus UI are more to your liking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Oppo Find 7 and the LG G3 are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipsets. Both smartphones have four Krait 400 cores and Adreno 330 graphics chips, and really only differ in regards to the exact chipset type, which on the Find 7 is the MSM8974AC chip, while on the G3 is the MSM8975AC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were able to test the LG-D855 model found in Europe, which sports 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The Oppo Find 7 comes with 3GB of RAM on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices have to push out the same number of pixels on their QHD displays, so we're not expecting one to be inferior to the other in terms of graphics performance. We are, however, expecting them to fall slightly behind 1080p-toting devices for the same reason stated above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to CPU performance, the international LG G3 underperforms compared to the majority of major flagships. The Find 7, on the other hand, reflects the highest numbers we've seen in this test, handily besting the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 in both single-core and multi-core performance.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Graphics benchmarks are where the LG G3 does better than the Find 7, although as expected both devices scored lower than their 1080p competitors. This difference is best observed in the onscreen performance of both smartphones, where the native QHD resolution is put to the test. The GFXBench 3.0 scores clearly demonstrate that the GPU's clearly have not caught up to high res display panels, as sub-15fps is clearly unplayable in any scenario.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Winner: Oppo Find 7. The Oppo Find 7 is one of the most capable devices we've tested, and the only area where it scores behind the LG G3 is in graphics performance. While both devices struggle to score highly in graphic-intensive tasks, the Find 7 does so well in every other area, that it beats out the 1080p-toting competition handily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, it's worth noting that the LG G3 heats up really quickly and that the quoted benchmark numbers represent a best case scenario. In reality, they dropped significantly from the quoted numbers after just a few minutes of active benchmarking.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG has a respectable and established camera division, oftentimes competing in image quality as well as value-added features with other mainstream flagships. Oppo is a relative newcomer to the scene, but nevertheless relies on its own applications in place of the standard Android media players and galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the Oppo Find 7 is a custom job, but surprisingly one with less features than the vanilla app. Obviously, Oppo has approached this interface with a less-is-more tactic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default view is a grid of folders, with a name and number of images for each folder labeled underneath. You can't filter images by location, time, people or tags like you would in the stock app. You can select multiple images (folders too) and then Share and Delete options become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG gallery is also somewhat pedestrian and doesn't have any sorting options. Editing is done through Google's Photos app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Music players are again very similar. They feature Now playing screens with prominent album art and playback options on the lockscreen and in the notification area. Both have great equalizer settings, with the G3 also letting you adjust pitch and playback speed and the Find 7 coming with the Wave MaxxAudio enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 comes with a pretty simple-looking video player, which supports DivX, AVI, MKV, MP4, etc. We had no issues playing files all the way up to 1080p resolution and the only real setback were certain files with XviD video or AC3 sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface for video selection is pretty basic too - a list of all available files. The player supports subtitles too, but there's only an on/off toggle here, you can't manually pick the subtitle file (so it would have to have the same name as the video file to work, and be in the same directory). Also, some foreign language subtitles didn't display all characters correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G3 is also very simple, but is still very powerful. It doesn't have as many features as those found on the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5, but it does make up for it with the ability to play all sorts of file types and video/audio codecs - virtually everything we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 supports QSlide, which puts the video in a small, resizable window if you want to use another app while watching video. You can even adjust the window transparency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. Although both devices have the upper hand over other flagships by being able to play 1440p videos at native resolution, the G3 has the upper hand with its more robust codec support and more refined video player interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 results in the first part of our audio quality test are nothing short of amazing. The smartphone produced the best numbers we've ever seen including a perfect -100 on the stereo crosstalk score. Sadly, the volume levels weren't quite up with the best so we can't unequivocally crown the G3, but it will be for those that value cleanliness above loudness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones tells a similar story - the output is almost perfectly clean (the stereo crosstalk reading while excellent on its own, is no longer the best we've seen), while the volume levels are slightly below average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 put in a stellar performance in in its own right, particularly the first part of our audio quality test. It had excellently high volume levels to go with its very clean output. Barring only the slightly high IMD reading, this is also one of the best score sets we've seen lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the smartphone faltered quite a bit when we plugged in a pair of headphones. Its frequency response started missing the mark now and then, the IMD rose further and the stereo crosstalk hiked quite a bit. It's not as bad as the stereo crosstalk disaster that was the 7a, but elsewhere the more premium member of the pair lagged behind its stablemate. Volume level dropped as well, adding up to what was a good, but not quite flagship-worthy performance here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G3 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. While the majority of users will be perfectly happy with the output of either smartphone, when it comes to headphones-on performance the Korean device is clearly superior.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 and LG G3 both have 13MP shooters that produce images of 4120 x 3160 pixels resolution. Although the produced stills are the same in terms of size, each sensor has a different field of view (FoV) that results in slightly narrower frame for the LG G3 compared to the Oppo Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices have good resolved detail and no traces of corner softness in the stills produced by either shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When shooting stills, LG is similar to its cross-town rival Samsung in that it relies on noise reduction filters to compensate for the slightly increased post-processing that it performs on its images. This results in images with a minor amount of noise, but with slightly reduced resolved detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 instead uses minimal amounts of post-processing and noise reduction, providing images that are crisper, but have a fair amount of noise. Ultimately, when it comes to level of detail, it's really a matter of preference as the two devices are very close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color-wise, the two cameras are very accurate, although when looking at side-by-side samples, the G3 has a slightly more neutral color tone that we liked better than the Find 7's. The find 7 tended to hue its images towards the red end of the color spectrum, but it's a very minor difference that can only be readily spotted when looking at the samples side-by-side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved dynamic range was slightly in the favor of the Find 7, although in some cases the G3 was the better performer in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This crop has the three primary colors visible - Red, Blue and Green. Although neither phone is exactly spot on with the rendering, the Find 7 has "punchier" colors which can be seen as a plus compared to the more natural-looking scene provided by the G3. Again, it's a matter of personal preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some full res samples, if you feel like performing your own comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to HDR, both devices tell a much different story. With the LG G3, any problems with dynamic range are all but gone, and you get some very high quality shots with little to no drawbacks. Shooting speed is perhaps the biggest downside on the G3, as it takes a while for the G3 to get ready for the next shot when shooting in this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR on the Oppo Find 7, on the other hand, also solves the dynamic range issues in the regular stills, but comes at a huge expense to color accuracy. Greens and blues in particular become overly vibrant, which is a hair better than being oversaturated, but ultimately results in images that don't reproduce the scene accurately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We moved to our dark room to try the low-light performance of both phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test is with the flash off. While the samples from both devices have traces of camera shake, it's the noise reduction-less shooting of the Oppo Find 7 that really does it a disservice here. The camera you can see very little in the way of resolved detail, while the G3 does well in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, we enabled the LED flashes (which only work at relatively short distances) and took more photos. On both devices the white balance went very much towards the red spectrum, more so for the LG G3. Here we again have a large amount of noise on the Oppo Find 7, but the addition of the flash brought with it some much needed stability, and resulted in slightly more detail than the G3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's some full resolution samples if you'd like to make your own comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, check out our Photo comparison tool that pits the two phones against each other, or any other device in our extensive database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G3 ? Oppo Find 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 also has a slew of nifty shooting modes, like its proprietary 50MP images that it is able to make by splicing together several lower-resolution shots. There's also the ability to shoot in RAW mode, although it's a somewhat buggy implementation that'll hopefully be fixed in a future software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has done away with many of its shooting extras in favor of a simpler interface. It does have the nifty magic focus feature that lets you choose an object to focus on after you take the picture. It requires some setup and a steady hand, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Both shooters are very capable, and each has its advantages in different areas. While the G3 results in less noisy images, the Find 7 oftentimes provides better resolved detail in most situations. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference, as each 13MP shooter relies on a different skillset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contrary to the still shooting mode, when it comes to shooting videos the LG G3 enjoys a wider field of view (FoV) in both 2160p and 1080p shooting modes. Otherwise, both camcorders record in 16:9 shooting ratios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that both phones are limited to just 5 minutes of 2160p videos, so if you need longer clips you'll have to settle for good old 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MP4 containers with the AAC codec are the choice for 2160p videos, but the Oppo Find 7 uses a higher framerate, 40Mbps, than the LG G3, 30Mbps. The two have the same audio bitrate, 96Kbps, and they both sound about the same in terms of fidelity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wider field of view means that you'll have a slightly closer view of things in 2160p videos, but that obviously means you'll be sacrificing in terms of a wider viewframe. Otherwise, colors and contrast are extremely accurate, with the Find 7 having slightly darker shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 1080p resolution, the Find 7 jumps ahead of the G3. The bitrate on the G3 comes down to around 10Mbps, while on the Find 7 you get a solid 20Mbps. The audio bitrate stays at 96Kbps for both devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the differences between the two devices are much more prevalent, with the Find 7 providing notably superior resolved detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both camcorders have 720p@120fps slow motion shooting modes, though they have very poor quality and look upscaled from a much lower resolution. There is also HDR video recording, which provides the same overly-vibrant colors like in the still images for the Find 7, while on the LG G3 it doesn't work at the highest available 2160p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices come with image stabilization, with the Find 7 relying on software to do the trick, while the G3 has an actual hardware stabilizer. We've taken a quick side-by-side video of the stabilization in action - both results are very similar, but we'd have to say that the G3 ultimately does a better job. Also, the G3's stabilization also helps you frame the photo better, as it helps dampen your hand movements even before you start shooting.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>   LG G3 vs. Oppo Find 7 at 2160p</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G3 vs. Oppo Find 7 at 1080p</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Oppo Find 7. The Find 7 offers a higher bitrate at both 2160p and 1080p shooting, which is especially noticeable in the latter case. At fullHD recording we saw much better resolved detail, and although the LG G3 has a slightly wider field of view, it's simply not enough to compensate for the lower bitrate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We won't go into detail about the phone and messaging apps, but the flagships offers some features that deserve a mention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both companies worked on their own keyboards. They have the basics like predictive input, swipe typing, and even floating layouts. LG has added a lot of nifty tricks that let the keyboard learn from your habits, including not only commonly used/misspelled words, but also the ability to register key-presses differently so you make fewer mistakes while typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 offers a great Swype-enabled keyboard with big keys and they become even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the wide screen is remarkably comfortable for two-thumb typing. There is an option to change the individual key height in both portrait and landscape, which isn't found that often. Themes are available too. You can also have split or mini keyboard layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing the device in landscape expands the keyboard immensely but leaves too little space for the text box above and we found ourselves never really using landscape as the portrait keyboard was spacious enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Data monitor app preloaded on the Oppo Find 7, which scans how much data you've used through Wi-Fi and the carrier network you're using. The app can set limits for usage and also break down the used data by apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's Health app performs basic fitness tracking functions, but feels more tacked on as a feature thrown in to compete with offerings from the likes of Samsung and Sony in their respective flagships. It tracks basic activities including walking, running, and cycling, and you can create a LG account to compete with other LG Health users as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the IR-port on the top of the LG G3 lets you control a wide variety of electronics and appliances via the QRemote app. QRemote has seen a wide range of improvements over its initial iteration on the G2, and now features a much larger database of TV sets, set-top boxes, and audio receivers than before. Even better, it gives you the ability to create a universal remote, complete with button mapping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. The G3 has a few extra features that give it the edge of the Oppo Find 7. QRemote is one of the better IR apps available on the market, and while we can't say the same thing about LG Health, it's better than nothing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to smartphones, oftentimes the companies that take the boldest steps and offer the latest tech in their products are the ones that are rewarded. While many other manufacturers decided to take the extra time to perfect their QHD display panels, LG and Oppo took the chance and outed their latest flagships early, and now stand as the only two offerings with 1440p displays on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For LG, the G3 is a much-needed dose of exclusivity that the company desperately needed in the wake of the numerous rival flagship announces at the beginning of the year. With Sony, Samsung, and HTC all beating them to the punch, LG needed something to set them apart in a crowd. The G3 is just that, but after having delivered so often in the past, the pressure is on for the G3 to sell - and sell well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One advantage that relatively unknown Chinese manufacturer Oppo has in relation to the mainstream competition is that expectations aren't nearly as high. When you're on the outside looking in, failures aren't as crushing, while successes are amplified. And it's precisely the successes that the Oppo Find 7 brings to the table that are most impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo was not only able to outdo its opponents in screen resolution with the Find 7, but also bring exceptional performance into the mix with its expertly-tuned processor. With an excellent camera thrown in to boot, the chart-topping benchmark figures we saw from the Find 7 almost make up for the poor numbers we saw in our dedicated battery test. Unfortunately, the latter proved to be the Achilles heel of Find 7, and while it's not necessarily a gamebreaker, it's definitely something potential buyers should keep in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Poor battery performance is also a primary concern for the LG G3, although not to such an extent as on the Find 7. LG's design department also did a phenomenal job in making the dimensions of their 5.5-inch flagship just barely higher than their 5.2-inch G2, and also smaller than many 1080p-toting rivals. And to be able to squeeze a QHD display into a relatively compact frame is even more commendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G3 also has a good amount of connectivity extras over the Find 7, and it's robust IR-app, 802.11ac connectivity, and FM radio (not to mention wireless charging) make it the more capable device in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a buyers' standpoint, it's important to keep in mind where these two companies lie relative to the current smartphone landscape. With LG, the company is betting heavily on the draw that it hopes its QHD display will generate. However, the sub-par contrast ratio and sunlight legibility as well as the added battery power required by so many additional pixels could result in a sub-optimal experience - a mistake that a top manufacturer like LG may not get away with easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is the case with most newcomers, any sort of publicity is good publicity, and topping our benchmark charts the Find 7 again brings Oppo into the conversation of elite smartphone offerings. Sales of the Find 7 may not be comparable to the likes of the G3 as Oppo is simply not a recognizable brand yet, but after this latest flagships we can't wait to see what they'll come up with next. For now, the Oppo Find 7 is a very capable flagship - QHD or otherwise - and since it's priced accordingly, it is certainly worth consideration for your next smartphone purchase. Just be sure to keep that 4.5Amp charger within arm's reach.</paragraph>
