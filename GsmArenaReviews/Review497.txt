			<paragraph>The upscale Samsung SGH-D410 brings plenty of innovations to the market. It is one of the first mobile phones with slide design and a 260K color display. The advanced features move Samsung SGH-D410 to higher price range. But is it worth?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have considered Samsung a company producing flip-phones (V-type) only, you are going to be surprised. Samsung offers a slide model classic conception similar to Nokia 7650 or Siemens SL55.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Not the smallest around <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Size comparison&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Phone seems quite well fed from its side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In locked position only the basic phone functions such as call making and receiving as well as phone book access are available. The keypad is locked, so you won't be able to write text messages. Nevertheless, a central cursor key, a correction key C, two call keys and two function keys are here at users disposal. LED blinks under the display in one of seven different colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Function keys are available even in locked position</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling with phone in locked position is a bit complicated. To wake up the phone, you have to press the green call or the side key for about 2-3 seconds. Phone reports that keypad is locked. To unlock it you should press the left function key with the three dots. After that you can start working with the phone. Easier and faster way to activate it is to slide-up the keypad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It's spinning <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Integrated camera rotating lens system&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equipped with a standard Li-Pol battery the handset worked approximately three or four days. The producer claims battery capacity of 900 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Side volume rock switch ? battery took out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall design is certainly interesting - high quality materials, even metal. We have always commended Samsung mobile phones for their solidity, this time the rear part doesn't keep tight as expected. On the other hand that's a usual complaint of all movable constructions. Essential weaknesses are the outstanding size of the handset and the external antenna, which could have been integrated without any service impacts. Anyway, Samsung SGH-D410 looks very attractive and I dare to say... valuable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Antenna is really whopping&nbsp;</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A really good display <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; There's no doubt - display is absolutely top-class </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung SGH-D410 is contemporary a top-class phone but surely we will relish soon more models showing over 100k colors. So, don't sell out your family possessions just to afford splendid display, it's really not necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Main display and various wallpapers&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Layout items are positioned in quite a traditional way. As usually, you will find signal and battery strength indicator, operator logo, date and time on the display. To customize your display you can choose one of the original wallpapers either as animation or as a static picture. There are two context keys assigned to the items on display. Left key stands for "Choose" and right one for "Cancel" function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Middle key still for WAP only <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle key still not used for confirmations ? keypad illumination</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's explore the main menu. As far as we know previous Samsung models this one will not surprise us. The item list has two different shapes. In the first case each item is separately displayed with an animated picture. The second form displays the icons small enough to see four of them at one glimpse. On lower levels items are displayed simply in a text form. You can also use key shortcuts to jump to a required item in the menu. I find this way especially efficient.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>&nbsp;Lower levels items.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hello, do you hear me? <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Dialed numbers are huge - that's benefit ?&nbsp; dialing number</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides SIM card capacity you can count on a free space in the phone memory. You can insert 1000 entries in the phone book. Actually, it's 1000 numbers, not contacts, that means if you insert three numbers under one name, they will fill three entries from 1000 available in the memory. Phone can handle both phone books together - SIM card and phone memory - and fortunately it is possible to search by more letters. You can't reach the phone book at "one touch", you have to use the menu. It's possible to sort contacts into 10 groups, for every one of them you can set up a different type of ringing, SMS tone or an icon. You can do the same with the contacts on the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's turn to the ringing tones. Polyphonic melodies with 64 voices is what I find revolutionary. Exploring the phone you'll find plenty of new melodies and I am sure that your ears will appreciate them. One of 10 different sounds can be assigned to an incoming SMS. I found the most attractive light effect. LED in the phone blinks intensely and if the message comes at night when you rest in a dark room, it seems like the message from heaven.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: Email for the first time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Writing text messages is quite enjoyable to do. Keypad is made of a solid material, with optimal tilt and comfortable size. It could be placed a bit lower, not to touch the top cover. The phone supports extended SMS of 918 characters, which is a length of six normal text messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Writing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone does not remember whether you wrote with or without T9 last time, it is activated always when you start writing new message. In default settings there are also capitals, which I find really trying. Phone counts down characters and when you exceed 160 characters it warns you that you are writing a second message. Concerning the messages memory, there is space for 200 messages at users disposal. The phone supports also delivery reports feature and picture messages EMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is necessary to mention the MMS messaging capability, which can be found as special item in the menu. Working with the MMS editor is foolproof: single messages can be paged, just keep in mind not to exceed the maximum given size of 100 kB. It is possible to make photos and voice records directly from the editor as well. Their maximum length is 30 seconds and you can store five of them on the phone. Total size of 1 MB of the memory is reserved for multimedia messages. Like in the SMS case you have T9 dictionary at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;MMS editor and MMS memory status data</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The e-mail client is working similarly to the MMS editor. You can attach photo, either new one or some of your saves. Equally voice recording is working. User can use five accounts and five profiles. T9 is available again for writing a text. It's possible to choose a signature, which includes name, phone number and comment. Emails can be forwarded in copies too. Interesting and useful feature is periodic control of incoming e-mails, where you can set interval from 1, 3, 6 or 12 hours. Phone reads header first, then message body.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Snap and shoot <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Camera menu ? before a scene appears on display you have to wait for a long time ? display during shooting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will probably wonder whether there are features to edit or enhance your shots. Yes, there are such. In the menu you'll be able to find several frames for your creations, in which you can turn and zoom the pictures in different ways. Don't forget that you can turn the whole lens system. Total memory size of approximately 3 MB is reserved for pictures. The same size is available for video files also. Those are saved in AVI format and can contain sounds too. You can shoot in resolution of 128 x 96 and 176 x 160 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;    &nbsp; Pictures from integrated camera. No praise for Samsung, pictures are fuzzy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures and videos can be transferred from the mobile to a PC via cable or computer. What you need is to install EasyGPRS communication software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handset supports Java. There are four pre-installed games. Though Java supports MIDP 2.0 standard, I didn't succeed to run the benchmark test Benchmark 2.0. In the older version 1.0 Samsung achieved value of 234 points, which is the fourth worst result in our list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Four Java games are included.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organiser as we already know it <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Organiser functions menu ? calendar ? feeding calendar with events</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasks ? alarm clock ? reminder setting </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock works even if the phone is switched off. Additionally, it's able to perform the so-called "wake up call/morning call" - if you have activated this feature, the phone will wake you up though silent mode is set. Three different alarms are adjustable; each one of them can work in a different day and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Alarms menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You won't be short of calculator if you decide for Samsung SGH-D410. Calculator does not ignore calculation priorities and handles tasks with brackets. There is also a currency converter and other units. Voice recording is available. The phone can make several records, which can be up to 30 seconds long. With little inconvenience you can use this dictaphone to record a dialog as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart calculator and integrated dictaphone surroundings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connection between handset and PC runs via cable or infrared. The phone has an integrated hardware modem and supports GPRS class 8. With the EasyGPRS communication software setting of data connection is simple. The available WAP browser is standard and thanks to the large display very well usable.</paragraph>
