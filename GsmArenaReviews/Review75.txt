		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It must be sweet October for Microsoft, with the launch of WinMo 6.5 on the 6th followed by the desktop Windows 7 on the 22nd. Acer are quick to sneak into the spotlight and make the most of the primetime coverage. Their neoTouch is leading a small PocketPC fleet, all powered by 6.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it's the flagship of course to focus all the attention and the neoTouch should be conscious of its task. If you want it all you need to be prepared to take it - all the glory and all the enemy fire. The neoTouch is riding on the wings of a dragon but entering a territory long claimed by others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch is not just the next in the growing line of Windows Mobile 6.5 handsets. It's the top device of a company that's determined to enter the mobile phone game with a bang. The 1 GHz Snapdragon CPU is a great way to start and the other ingredients look quite on par: complete connectivity options, spacious high-res screen and something becoming fairly typical for smartphones these days - a 5 megapixel snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today Windows Mobile is all about handset manufacturers customizing the OS with their own proprietary interface, such as the popular TouchFLO by HTC, Samsung's TouchWiz and the LG S-Class. Acer have given the neoTouch their own homescreen, brand new Phonebook and Organizer app (called Agenda), along with a neat Preferences menu and Communication manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first, let's go over what the Acer neoTouch does and doesn't do. PocketPC spec sheets are quite a reading but potential deal breakers won't be overlooked either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neoTouch is the first Snapdragon device we're reviewing but the bigger debut is Acer themselves. Since February 2009 - when they made headlines at the Barcelona WMC - Acer have released 4 handsets all in all that have no corresponding entry in the Eten glofish lineup. (It was the acquisition of Eten that put Acer on the mobile phone map.) And we're looking at one of them making a strong claim to challenge the big ones in the PocketPC game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer credentials as leading laptop manufacturer will have the neoTouch - and the phones to follow - held to a rather high standard. We're dealing with a debut but it looks bold enough at least on paper. And we won't mind another keen compatriot rivalry along the lines of Samsung and LG. Of course, HTC are well ahead at this point but Acer look like they should be taken seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But much like every other Windows Mobile smartphone out there, the Acer neoTouch has it strong and weak points. You can be sure we will explore both of them, on the pages to follow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Acer neoTouch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Starting with the basics, in the retail box you'll find a charger, data cable and a headset. The headset is one piece, but you can use your favorite headphones of course, thanks to the 3.5mm audio jack. The wall charger is universal and you get market-specific adaptors - just like you would with HTC handsets. The charger connects to the phone's microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail box will also include manuals and a disk with software. Given that this is a high-end PocketPC, we were a little disappointed to see that there were no additional accessories in the box. There is no memory card - which the neoTouch certainly needs, given the 300 MB of onboard storage available to the user. A TV out cable is nowhere in sight either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer neoTouch 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a phone that's easily in the top 5 in terms of screen estate, the Acer neoTouch size is quite friendly. It measures 118.6 x 63 x 12 mm and weighs in at 130 grams. Tiny it isn't, but the 3.8" touchscreen is a good enough excuse and the best way to prove this is putting it alongside some of the competition. The neoTouch is almost the same size as the iPhone and noticeably smaller than the Omnia HD and it beats both in terms of screen size. Yes, it looks massive next to the HTC Touch 2 but the displays are incomparable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing to note - other than the huge touchscreen - is perhaps the distinct styling of the controls underneath. Not too keen on the green / red receiver convention, we quite liked the original minimalist pictograms marking the hardware buttons. The actual controls - Call buttons, Home key, Back key - are touch-sensitive and haptic-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the Acer neoTouch is not willing to go to extremes to distinguish itself from the countless touchscreen bars out there. Instead it takes a rather cautious and traditional approach to styling. The Acer neoTouch front is quite conservative with black glass framing the display and the surface of the buttons. The rest of the handset is made of glossy plastic and while it's not cheap looking, the fingerprints just love to make their home there. The whole handset was completely covered with smudges in no time and didn't look nice at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy silver strip running the sides are the only accent and it works quite well. It's elegant and subtly emphasizes the huge display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch display is a TFT unit, 3.8 inches in diagonal and within the limits of comfortable one hand use. The resolution is WVGA at 480 x 800 pixels - the highest any smartphone has gone so far. As far as screen sensitivity goes, the Acer neoTouch resistive unit is better than the XPERIA X1 and X2 and on par with the latest HTC handsets. We have nothing to complain about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is not one of its strengths though. It's far behind the iPhone and Nokia devices. Using the neoTouch in direct sunlight is near impossible, so you may want to look for some shade nearby if outdoor use is absolutely essential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is expected on a Windows Mobile device, the Acer neoTouch screen has 65K-color support. On a screen this size, color banding really becomes an issue. But we all know the limited color palette is not Acer's fault, but rather a limitation imposed by Microsoft. To give you a bit of background, Windows Mobile uses a 16-bit color palette  (that's 65K colors) for CPU friendliness and optimal performance. We are sure it made perfect sense a few years back, but now that we have Snapdragon processors and a lot more RAM we may as well start hoping for a boost to color support. That will perhaps involve the guys at Redmond rewriting the whole OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the neoTouch physical description, the video-call camera, proximity and ambient light sensors, along with a status LED are placed above the display on both sides of the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the handset you get the hardware Lock key and nothing else. The key is quite handy actually - conveniently placed for your index finger (for right-handed users).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neoTouch right side features the volume rocker, reset hole and the camera shutter key. The camera key has a distinct half and full press and is quite responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5 mm standard audio jack and the stylus compartment are at the top of the Acer neoTouch. The bottom reveals the microphone and the microUSB port, which is not protected by a cover. The phone charges via the USB port, which is quite useful as you can skip the charger when traveling if you have a computer with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the stylus is not active as those on the HTC devices. It would have been a really nice addition to the Acer neoTouch user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch rear is neat and simple - quite in line with the conservative styling of the device. There you'll find the 5 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash, along with a loudspeaker grill. The Acer neoTouch has no stereo speakers on board, but it's still not considered a standard feature even on high-end smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As there is no lens cover, the 5 megapixel camera lens is exposed to both smudges and scratches</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover, you'll find a 1350 mAh battery and the SIM card slot as well as the microSD card slot. Hot-swap is enabled but a card slot placed externally on the device would've been a lot better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch can be commended on its high build quality. The all-plastic looking chassis looks and feels quite fit and durable. The rear cover holds firmly in place, no annoying creaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch weighs in at 130 grams and that's perfectly acceptable given the spacious screen. It's not a small handset but size is well atoned for by the classic, subtle styling and secure handhold. The extreme edges of the screen may be a little hard to reach for some, but the device is still pocketable and reasonably comfortable to navigate single-handedly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Mobile 6.5 is not breath-taking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In addition to the new Windows Mobile 6.5 homescreen, the Acer neoTouch offers a new one very similar to the Home tab of the new upcoming TouchFLO update. There you can find a digital clock, the date and nine customizable app shortcuts. At the bottom are found the lock, start menu and options buttons. The homescreen, as you can see, is touch-optimized and practical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if you are keen on the new default Windows Mobile 6.5 homescreen you can switch to it at any time. For more information about the new interface and features of WinMo 6.5, read our review here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the Start menu icon at the top right no longer opens a drop down menu full of shortcuts. Instead it opens what we like to call the new Windows Mobile "Main menu". It's got icons ordered in that oh-so-popular honeycomb pattern that so many people can easily recognize as pure WinMo 6.5 stuff thanks to numerous official and leaked screenshots. A shortcut to the start menu is also available at the bottom of the Acer homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the new main menu you've got all the installed programs plus shortcuts to the settings menu. That Settings menu also has received a facelift and displays icons in the same honeycomb structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another simplified Preferences menu provided by Acer where you can do some basic stuff such as change ringtones and sound levels, wallpapers, choose the end key functionality or start the Acer Communication Manager. It's very similar to every other custom Comm. Manager available today, where you can switch on/off the different types of connections - Phone, Data, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The perfectly flat structure of the Main menu can certainly get a bit clumsy over time due to the huge number of icons that pile up there (iPhone users with loads of apps installed will know what we mean) but we'd still prefer that over the confusing experience that so many Windows Mobile new adopters have enjoyed in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Mobile 6.5 brought larger fonts to all menus, which made them a lot more touch friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice change brought by the new version of the OS is the option to alternate tabs by simple finger sweeps wherever Windows offers you tabbed screens. You no longer need to aim for the tiny titles at the bottom of the screen as on the WinMo 6.1 handsets - you just swipe your finger across the screen and the next tab opens instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Acer neoTouch is the first smartphone we've reviewed powered by the Snapdragon 1GHz CPU, we decided to do a benchmark and see how it stacks up next to a previous generation CPU - in our case HTC Touch Diamond with 528 MHz MSM7200 Qualcomm CPU. From the screenshots bellow you may see that CPU results of the Snapdragon are 3 times better than its older Qualcomm sibling, while the other benchmark results vary from two to six times better. The evolution is obvious and we are quite impressed with the whole Windows Mobile 6.5 performance - there is no lag anywhere in the Windows interface and all the stuff just flows smoothly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer-touched contact manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have unlimited contacts list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options. Shame it's so damn ugly. Even when Windows Mobile reached its 6.5 version, the Contacts remained untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's no more. Same as HTC, Acer have added a new interface here which uses a small thumb icon for a person's phone (while HTC uses pictures), set against a gray background with a nice font. You can pick a letter of the alphabet by using the letter column placed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an index search, where you see all used/unused alphabet letters and can choose one of them and see the contacts starting with it. We didn't find this option that helpful, largely because it was easier to use the handy letter column on the right. Still you can choose which of these two options will be your default or you can leave them both available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In contrast to the HTC's TouchFLO implementation, where editing all fields in a contact throws you back into the old WinMo skin, Acer did quite good job offering a whole new interface for this task. It uses the new phonebook design and colors and is nicely touch optimized. But don't worry - you still have a plethora of available info fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact details is a whole new experience. Acer have done a great job again redesigning the whole interface into something quite stylish and visually attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some functional changes too. The contact's information is divided into groups - names, communication and information. The new addition here is the social networking button which will open the Flickr/Facebook/Blogger account of the contact if available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is always a priority for any cellphone - that still holds true for smartphones such as the Acer neoTouch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone application offers Smart dialing, so you hardly ever need to go to the Contacts list in order to dial a number. It also offers favorites tab where you can set up to 15 numbers for speed dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During calls, the Acer neoTouch allows you to take some notes, as on every Windows Mobile device. Another OS feature is rejecting a call with a text message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch scored a Below Average mark in our loudspeaker performance test, which was a nasty surprise. In fact, if there were a category lower than Below Average, neoTouch would have probably scored that instead. Those are some of the lowest results we've ever recorded. While it is noticeably louder when playing music through the loudspeaker, you are bound to have a lot of calls missed with ringing performance such as this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the neoTouch stacks up against some other handsets we've tested. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Old school messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor and thanks to Windows Mobile 6.5, you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and through longer messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the message tab remains the original and untouched Windows Mobile 6.5, where the only upgrade is the touch-optimized menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threaded SMS is also available on the neoTouch, just as it is across Windows 6.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email editor will hold no surprises for experienced WinMo users as it has not changed at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest mid or high range phones. You type your email and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the Acer neoTouch. Acer have equipped the device with two home-grown thumbable virtual keyboards. It's a commendable feature since the default Windows Mobile keyboards are fit for stylus use only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first keyboard is a full portrait touch optimized QWERTY and the second one is the same QWERTY in landscape mode. The regular WinMo QWERTY for use with a stylus is as usual onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handwriting recognition is also available and works just fine.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch offers a small amount of storage - about 300MB. This is barely sufficient and you'll definitely find yourself needing a higher-capacity microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager is the standard Windows Mobile one and won't surprise anyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image gallery stays the same, Albums are a bit better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer neoTouch offers two galleries available from the Multimedia folder in the Start menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is the standard Windows Mobile 6.5, which is the same is 6.1, except for the touch optimized menu. It has no accelerometer features and you can't flick scroll images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Album app is a new addition by Acer and may not be something innovative or beautiful, but is still better than the WinMo one. It's touch optimized and has accelerometer auto-rotation. Once the image is opened, you can zoom in or out or continue to the previous/next by sweeping a finger on the current one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling to the next image is smooth and instantaneous with a single sweep of the finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music and video - Windows Media player only</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately Acer did not include any music or video player and left the users with the embedded Windows Media player. As usual it's horrible at managing playlists with your favorite songs, and generally it has limited functionality and the interface is less than touch-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching varied video content is almost a no-go as there is a limited number of supported video formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Core player comes to the rescue </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unless you really want to leave that Snapdragon sleeping in its lair, you may want to install a third-party multimedia player such as Core player. It successfully played all DivX/Xvid movies up to HD resolution, except those which use the AC3 audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we have to admit that the neoTouch disappointed us when it came to HD. We expected most of the HD videos to play smoothly with that Snapdragon core inside, but we were so wrong. The official DivX HD commercials reached 15-16 fps only, while the videos recorded by Omnia HD hit the 19 fps mark. And that's as high as it went.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway if you can skip the HD playback (it doesn't really make sense on a mobile screen anyway), you will be happy to know that all other videos we tried played smoothly with no audio problems or dropped frames. We ran some benchmarks with the Core Player against the HTC Touch Diamond and here are the results. As you can see, the difference is similar with the Spb benchmark results we did before.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The FM radio does the job perfectly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch built-in FM radio naturally requires the headset to be plugged-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neoTouch FM radio has an excellent interface and offers memory for 20 radio stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS is available too - so overall, radio is handled pretty well on the Acer neoTouch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First-class audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that caught us totally off guard. Not only is the audio quality of the Acer neoTouch very good for a first attempt, but it is great all over. In fact not too many of the handset we have tested can rival the neoTouch balanced output, let alone the WinMo ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response graph is virtually perfect throughout the audible range. The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk results are also some way above the average others achieve in this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a table comparing the Acer neoTouch to some of its competitors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera not really our favorite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch has a 5 megapixel auto focus camera producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The camera offers an intuitive user interface and shoots in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neoTouch camera also sports a LED flash, but it barely makes a difference in low-light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interface and features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neoTouch camera viewfinder is familiar resembles those on the Samsung Omnia II and 8300 UltraTOUCH. The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all controls you may need placed on the two vertical taskbars on both sides of the viewfinder. There you can change the shooting mode, turn on/off the time stamp, change resolution, choose white balance or flash mode or hit the advanced settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the advanced settings, they offer tuning of ISO, default storage, stabilizer, image properties (contrast, brightness, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The geo-tagging support on the Acer neoTouch allows you to record you current location in the EXIF of your images. You can use it once you choose the POI shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch produces passable photos with good levels of detail. The noise levels are tolerable, though sometimes they can be a bit higher than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately our unit had some problems with the white balance and the color accuracy, but we tried to fix that by using the in-camera White balance presets (with varying success).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos may not be as good as the Nokia 6700 classic or Sony Ericsson C901, but still looks good enough to satisfy most of the users. And if Acer fix the white balance issue, the camera may jump even to the decent level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Acer neoTouch. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the resolution chart, the resolved detail is not as much as we hoped but the resolution is enough for a 5 megapixel snapper and there are no obvious lens issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the Acer neoTouch can offer VGA resolution at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the one of the still camera, except for the fact that some options have been disabled. Unluckily, there is no video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are not as nice as we expected. Though contrast and the actual frame rate are quite good, the videos suffer from some excessive compression and lack of detail so they look as if extrapolated from QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity the Acer neoTouch has it all covered - HSDPA 7.2Mbps, HSUPA 5.76Mbps, Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth + EDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neoTouch has quad-band GSM support and tri-band 3G - 900, 1900 and 2100 MHz bands are supported. You can check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 is supported as well through a miniUSB adaptor. When connected to a computer, the neoTouch prompts you to select among ActiveSync, Mass Storage or Modem modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Mass Storage mode, the memory card is mounted as a removable drive on the computer for faster file transfers. The only downside is in this mode you have no access to the memory card from the handset itself - the card becomes invisible to the file manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer web browsing is surprisingly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, this is the really interesting part - the new version of the Internet Explorer Mobile web browser has received a nicer touch-optimized interface and way cooler skin. It now sports kinetic scrolling and full Flash support, and should give you the browsing experience that it fails to deliver on the competing devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five available settings for text size and there is a mobile view mode. Still, on a high-res screen we are far more comfortable using the desktop mode, as web pages look much more natural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming though is best done with double tapping on the IE. It worked like a charm on the Acer neoTouch. Double taps are certainly more comfortable than the alternative zoom bar. To get to it you either use the dedicated button at the bottom of the screen or hold your finger on the screen to launch a context menu with a zooming option. And to add to the discomfort, when you zoom you loose the Fit-to-screen capability, so prepare for a lot of side scrolling to read those texts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In contrast to the IE browser on the Samsung Omnia II, this version here does automatically rotate the pages thanks to the built-in accelerometer. The lack of that one on Omnia II was a huge bummer and we are happy to see that either Microsoft or Acer have found a way around that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's even better, the Mobile IE loads and scrolls faster than in the Omnia II and definitely features some kind of optimization. This time we really enjoyed browsing with it and we're happy to see it's going in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But other options still remain and Opera Mobile is still the best among the Windows Mobile browsers and is available for free download. Even optimized, Internet Explorer still has a lot to catch up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Agenda will get you organized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with Outlook. In the Acer neoTouch the Calendar app still exists deep in the menu, but Acer created their own management software called Agenda.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda is a very simple yet nice organizer. The only offered view is monthly, where you can view the different events for each day by tapping on a particular date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set an appointment or anniversary. Both of them have only the most common fields - subject, location, time, date. For all the other stuff you'll need to go to the Windows Mobile original Calendar. We know this will frustrate some hardcore users, but others surely will be happy to lose all the unnecessary text fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps, which need no explanations, are the Calculator, MSN Money (stocks), MSN Weather, To-Do list and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the limited customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some third-party alternative.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office Mobile is readily available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Power Point presentations are opened automatically in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no PDF reader preinstalled and you will need to buy one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since Acer are not keen on customizing Windows Mobile, you can't expect much from the application department either. There are only a few apps provided by default and really not enough to satisfy our expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the already mentioned apps in the organizer sections we have standard Windows Live services such as Live Search and MSN Messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Streaming Media manager allows access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social Networking app gives you access to your Flickr, Facebook or Blogger profiles. Facebook is the official Windows Mobile Facebook app, while Flickr and Blogger can be accessed through the Social Networking app itself and have simplified interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Windows Mobile Solitaire and Bubble Breaker game duo are also onboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS with no navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch comes with built-in GPS with support from Assisted-GPS technology, commonly known as A-GPS. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one GPS app - the GPS Viewer - where you can see your current GPS coordinates and satellite data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Acer neoTouch has no SatNav software preinstalled - not even Google Maps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch left us with mixed feelings. On the plus side it comes with the much heralded high-end 1Ghz Snapdragon CPU. It also has a huge 3.8" display and runs the latest Windows Mobile OS. And last but not least, it handles the OS very well and packs all kinds of connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching to the negatives, Acer have done little to customize the OS, there is no dedicated music or video player beyond what Microsoft have to offer (and it's not much). There's no DivX/XviD support, the camera photo and video quality is a downer and there is no GPS satnav software on board. Acer have left Windows Mobile almost stripped to the bone, and this is inexcusable given what the likes of HTC and Samsung are doing in terms of making the interface more user-friendly. The final straw comes from the less than stellar video playback and poor choice of accessories in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit though the neoTouch is not among the top-priced smartphones out there, so the lack of sweeties in the box and other omissions such as the GPS navigation software are not a major point against. But even for a mid-priced device we don't think it's too much to ask for a decent music player and some additional codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A strong competitor with that kind of CPU under its hood and an even bigger 4.1" screen is the Toshiba TG01. Yet somehow we feel that its dimensions (except for the thickness) have crossed a certain line making usability questionable. The higher price and the relatively limited market availability are also hurting the TG01's chances. Not that Toshiba have done any deep customizations of the OS themselves either.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond2 is on the list too, though it doesn't even come close to a 3.8" screen or a 1GHz CPU. However at this stage the HTC champ has a more attractive price tag and that - combined with the time-tested TouchFLO 3D UI - might be enough to keep users interested. More importantly though, Windows Mobile 6.5 is already available for the Diamond2. HTC devices have a wide user base too and the strong community is always ready to give you a tip or help you tweak your gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Diamond2 is an option rather than a major challenge. The HD2 however should be downright scary. The Sense UI and capacitive touchscreen may just be too much for the neoTouch to beat. Not to mention the unmatched screen estate, though the 4.3" diagonal does raise some usability questions. Oh, and for the record, we're talking Snapdragon here as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia II already managed to impress us and it's perhaps set to give the neoTouch a good run for its money. It might not have the sheer processing power of the Acer neoTouch but the actual handling and response were perfect. The 3.7" AMOLED screen, fully customized UI, huge internal storage and all kind of software goodies make the I8000 Omnia II a serious player in the smartphone field this holiday season. For a few euros more than the neoTouch, the Omnia II delivers a mighty capable PocketPC without worries you might be missing on any key feature.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Honestly, we can't find it in our hearts to recommend the neoTouch as strongly as we would some of their Timeline laptops. It does have its good and bad points and given the current price it might be a reasonable investment of your money. Still, you may want to wait a bit for a price drop and see what kind of extra support Acer are willing to provide to make it a more attractive device. If that happens, the NeoTouch will be a handset worth considering. As for Acer, we don't need to tell you they're worth keeping an eye on. We, for one, would be glad to meet the Liquid.</paragraph>
