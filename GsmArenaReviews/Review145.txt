			<paragraph>How many phones can you name that would have made sense centuries back? Here's one: the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte. No, we're not talking medieval calling and texting, we're talking gold and leather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, it may not be solid gold, but it's the next best thing - the Arte is gold plated alright, but it sure looks - better yet, glitters - the part. Gold does not react with air and moisture so even after thousands of years gold artifacts do not loose their luster. Well, that's one thing you get for your dime - everlasting shine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's like choosing the interior of a ridiculously expensive car - creme leather, mahogany, you get the picture. Same with Nokia's Arte series - Sapphire, Carbon fiber and now leather and gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color of gold depends on relativistic effects acting on the electrons? nah, no matter how you twist it an 8800 phone will not interest geeks. It is all about exclusive materials, high build quality and most importantly - making you look good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of technology, it's forged in the same crucible as the Nokia Carbon Arte - OLED screen, 3G, 3 megapixel autofocus camera, 4GB of inbuilt memory and Series 40.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking value for money with the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte, or any of its siblings, will make as much sense as attaching an enjoy responsibly message to the Vertu Concierge service. Though the Arte Gold doesn't go as far as the Vertu, exuberance is its very name and the materials and looks certainly hold their own against the luxury models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That is not to say it's cheap - save for the Motorola Aura, the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is the most expensive phone you can buy from a mainstream manufacturer. For the same price, you could buy the Carbon Arte plus a Nokia E71 and still have a little cash left to play with. But then, it is gold-plated and that's very much where your money's going.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 8800 Arte ? Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte ? Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upgrading a phone from the 8-series is obviously not about enhancing the capabilities - it's about using even more exclusive materials and denying common sense. After all, previous 8-series owners are unlikely to suddenly jump to Symbian or E-series unless they start gold-plating those as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Gold Arte is probably targeting all of those Luna and Sirocco users who decided to? um? save their cash and skip the Sapphire and Carbon generation and jump at the next big thing. The Gold Arte will also most probably be quite popular among the ladies as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, Carbon Arte owners will probably want to wait for Diamond Arte or Wooden Arte or whatever comes next (they've already done Titanium).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sole purpose of the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is to send subliminal (though not very subtle) messages to everyone around you, not quite in keeping with the Connecting People spirit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we're about to take a closer look at another Arte handset. Right after this short jump, we'll ooh and ahh over the hardware - for the lack of a better word.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The retail box is a true treasure chest<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box looks like something a pirate used to stash its plunder - it's not just the phone that's covered in gold, both the Bluetooth headset and the desktop charger are also painted gold. The other offering you might appreciate is the carrying pouch, which is made of soft white leather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The desktop cradle doesn't do much since you could plug the charger directly into the phone. However, it does serve a vital function - it shows off the phone. It bears the Nokia logo proudly and when people see it sitting on your desk, there's little doubt what handset you have there in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch on the desktop cradle is the translucent bottom. This lets some light pass through and creates a pleasing visual effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also weighs a ton, but that gives it stability with help from the rubbery material on the bottom. You wouldn't want it to fall, would you? Plus, it makes it look like an Oscar statuette.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bluetooth headset is a natural choice over a regular wired one. It's not about the money, it's just that business suits and wires don't go together terribly well. The white leather pouch however is spot on, complementing the white leather on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The huge cleaning cloth, typical for the Artes, is also included. It's big enough to wipe your windshield with, completely over the top of course, but more is better, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a whole lot of paper and a CD with the required software for syncing you phone with a PC.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 8800 Gold Arte 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Gold Arte measures 109 x 45.6 x 14.6 mm totaling a volume of 65cc, which is identical to its siblings. Actually, size and shape are pretty much set in stone for the whole 8800 Arte lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It weighs 150 grams, same as the Carbon Arte, which is strange given that carbon fiber is supposed to save weight. Apparently, that only works for boats and racing cars, not mobile phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Gold Arte has virtually the same design as every other Arte out there. You could call it repetitive or maybe it's just that Nokia think the design is perfect and there's nothing to improve upon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no alternative color versions of the Gold Arte - it's gold colored with white leather. Some choice in color at least for the leather would have been nice but we guess third-party stores might be happy to offer you alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout of controls on the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte isn't any different from the first three family members. The earpiece is dead center at the top of the front panel. Below it is the 2-inch OLED display, followed by the four main controls (two soft keys, Call and End key) and the D-pad. Those are all on the small side but not unforgivably so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the phone is closed the keypad is hidden under a leather-bound cover. Double-tapping it displays a digital or analogue clock on the phone screen, which is quite a convenient way of checking the time without having to unlock the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are very few things to note on either side of the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte. The loudspeaker grill is on the right and there is a battery cover release button on either side. Even though the camera has autofocus, there's no dedicated shutter key in sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key, which can also be used for switching ringing profiles, is placed at the top of the phone. It's large size makes it easy to press even without turning the phone around to face you. Perhaps too easy since it's quite prone to accidental presses. This is most apparent when putting the phone in the carrying pouch. We inadvertently powered off the device on a couple of occasions, something that seems an issue with all the Artes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is at the bottom of Nokia 8800 Gold Arte, right next to the mouthpiece. The microUSB is also used for connecting the charger, so there is one less aperture to spoil the fine gold-plated lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the phone hosts the 3 megapixel autofocus camera lens, which doesn't have a flash of any kind. The Gold Arte was meant to be photographed not to take photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover gets removed by pressing the two release buttons on the sides of the phone and pulling it down. Under it you will find the 1000 mAh battery, which is supposed to last 300 hours in stand-by or 3 hours of talk time. Battery life is adequate for the class with performance identical to the previous Arte models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the design. It's a top-of-the-class handset and if something had to be said about the build quality - that would be worrying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high quality casing is a delight to look at and the gold certainly catches the eye. That is if you happen to like golden accessories as some would say it's over the top. The leather on the back and front earns high marks - it's warm to the touch making the phone very pleasant to hold. The handset is naturally quite heavy given the materials it's made of, but this simply adds to the overall air of quality it gives off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes a little while to learn to slide the phone open without pressing any keys or getting too many fingerprints on the screen but once you get it right the sliding mechanism with its spot on spring-assisted action makes sliding smooth and natural. The display also manages to hide the fingerprints quite well.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The OLED display has excellent picture quality but smallish size<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is equipped with a 2" 16M-color OLED display with QVGA resolution, like the one on its predecessors. OLED has significantly better contrast and brightness and the black is truly black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two things that we didn't like about the display. The first is the sunlight legibility - it is very poor, making the phone hard to use outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the second bit that disappointed us - Nokia have put a 2.6" OLED screen on the N85, so why is the Gold Arte limited to a miserly 2"? Cost can't be the problem, nor technical limitations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is rather good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is much to our liking, with decently-sized keys and terraced layout. Typing would've been perfect save for the inadequate room for the top row of buttons - it's just too cramped up against the ridge below the softkeys. If you bear in mind that this isn't really designed as a texter's phone, then the keyboard is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the phone is also top notch: strong and even, it makes the phone look as good in the dark as in bright daylight. The light sweeps smoothly from top to bottom, putting on a nice little show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one little problem with the keyboard - from certain angles the key symbols are hard to read but its nothing to trouble you too much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: nothing we haven't seen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you expected miracles from Nokia 8800 Gold Arte's software department you will probably end up disappointed. It is absolutely identical to the original Arte and that's why this software part of the review might be familiar to you if you have been keeping track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen displays the pre-selected wallpaper plus signal strength, battery status and time in the top bar. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the labels of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn active standby on. It consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated to suit the user's preferences. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom events from the calendar are displayed for the current day. A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two soft keys' functionality can also be altered if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 8800 Gold Arte can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons our personal choice remains the typical grid view with icons. If you prefer to have more icons appear on screen, you can go for the grid view without text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons of the main menu can be freely reordered to suit the user's taste. An interesting thing to note here is that the Opera Mini browser, the calculator and the WidSets application can be found directly in the main menu. They are also featured in the applications folder so, basically, you can access them from wherever you want. Probably these three were considered important enough to place in the main menu for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus follow no consistent pattern. Some items have captions, others do not. In certain cases, you will even be able to see the selected item described in small font, so you will not need to go down any further in the menu. As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keypad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lag or holdups. This is the case with basically any S40 device nowadays and we wouldn't expect any less from the Gold Arte. Also, there were no halts or unexpected restarts during the time of our review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wide variety of themes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Heavy on looks throughout, the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte comes with seven preinstalled themes. All of them fit the ethos of the handset with their conservative styling. There are of course many additional themes available for download online. There are even some that produce sounds on certain events, such as opening or closing the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are as many as five predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 8800 Gold Arte, plus a Flight mode that turns off all transceivers on the device. That number should be enough to have you covered in practically any circumstances. The flight mode can turn out very convenient if you decide to use your phone as an MP3 player and it can be used without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 8800 Gold Arte offers space for up to 2000 contacts and extensive configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. Also, first names are separated from last names eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. The picture displayed is different for incoming and outgoing calls, as it fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and only take a small part of it when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contacts: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. The phonebook font size can also vary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is done by gradual typing. Contacts can also be organized in groups and these can consequently be used as call filters. Another praiseworthy application is the voice dial, which requires no pre-recording of the commands and phonebook names. It is even equipped with a training application that helps for better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 8800 Gold Arte won't surprise anyone who has ever held a Series 40 device in their hands. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them together. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and call quality are in line with the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte's high standards. Calls are loud and clear on both ends eliminating any possible obstacles to communication. After all a handset like the Gold Arte is mainly intended to be used for making calls so any compromise in this area would be a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, many would consider the lack of video calling a real disappointment since it feels that the 3G support is not being used to the maximum. Of course, video calling is something we can live without, but it wouldn't hurt to have the option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is the turn-to-mute functionality. It allows muting an incoming phone call or an alarm by simply flipping the device over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 8800 Gold Arte ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. It certainly doesn't have the loudest speaker around but it's a certain improvement over the previous Artes, which only scored Below Average in our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the test itself, as well as results from other tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is well oragnized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Message menu of Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is almost perfectly organized. The handset is capable of handling practically any type of message - SMS, EMS, MMS and e-mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three types share an editor and all you need to convert an SMS to an EMS or MMS is to apply text formatting or insert any multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to set a contact as a messaging favorite in case you frequently write to one particular person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. Naturally, the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary to make texting even less of a chore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will be divided into constantly visible. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is ok. It automatically adjusts its settings once you enter your email address and then all you need to do is enter your username and password. No more time wasted on trying to get a long list of settings right for the client to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes. When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Outgoing attachments are not limited in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client downloads the headers and then offers to download the entire body of the messages you need. You can also set the messages to be automatically downloaded in full if data traffic is no problem.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is identical to those found in the other Series 40 devices (like Nokia 6600 slide for example). Looks have improved but all remains unchanged featurewise. The music player sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The great advantage over the other Arte siblings is that the inbuilt storage has been boosted to 4 GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player works with MP3, MIDI, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. The supported A2DP profile allows you to listen through Bluetooth wireless earphones. The player looks can be changed to the classic skin if that suits the user better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset uses the microUSB jack for connecting a headset, so finding a set of headphones for listening to music may turn out to be tricky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience of the player is enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. Nokia 8800 Gold Arte has only one loudspeaker located on the side, right next to the camera. We already mentioned that we weren't terribly impressed by its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, we have to mention that it does not get muffled at all when the phone body is placed on its back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no FM radio on Nokia 8800 Gold Arte, something the Luna used to have. So if you get bored with the music player all you can do is turn the video on. The video player is compatible with the 3GP and MP4 formats and videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode is nice and generally improves video watching.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery: C'mon, Nokia, it's time for some improvements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We personally aren't great fans of how the gallery looks in Series 40 models. The fact that it also acts as a file manager somewhat hurts its user-friendliness and looks. For example you do need a few extra presses to get to your photo files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery relies on your putting the right type of files in the right folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom in on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest thing around and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so it's not actually that useful a function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures can also be viewed in fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The editor however offers very limited options, but considering very few users actually use a picture editor on their phones, this is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter can be quite convenient for finding a specific file in large folders. Nonetheless, the gallery on Series 40 devices could be improved a lot, especially in terms of user friendliness and we do hope that at some point in the future the file manager and the gallery on these phones will be separate applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: 3 megapixels that leave much to be desired<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Gold Arte is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera with autofocus. Typical for Series 40, the camera settings are limited, but that makes them simpler and easier to use. The settings include white balance, three photo quality options going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, as mentioned, there is no flash on the device, which makes photos in low light conditions unusable. Even in good conditions the photo quality is not on a par with the best 3 megapixel cameraphones such as the Sony Ericsson K810. The noise levels are high not only in the shadow areas but in the well lit ones too. Just look at the skies from the samples below and you will get the idea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two disappointments about the camera that are not directly related to picture quality. The first is the absence of a lens cover. The Nokia 8800 Gold Arte camera only relies on the fact that it is slightly recessed into the surface to avoid scratches. We don't think that's sufficient for such a phone but the Nokia R&amp;D team probably though that lens protection would ruin the design. Anyway, this is maybe the best reason to carry your phone around in the leather case that comes in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated shutter button is another real letdown when it comes to operating the camera. It is quite uncomfortable, especially when shooting in landscape mode, to use the confirm button of the D-pad for that purpose. Besides, the function of the capture key changes to delete once a photo is taken which is only likely to confuse people. Although erasing a photo by accident is very unlikely as confirmation is still required, we can't help wishing the Nokia designers did better here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Gold Arte also manages video recording. It can capture videos in VGA resolution. The frame rate is only 15fps and that is quite a downer considering the fact that even modest handsets like Nokia 6303 classic can do that. The videos are captured in 3GP format and their length is only limited by the free memory available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still no memory card slot and Wi-Fi support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is decently covered in the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte. The main focus here is USB and it is really seamless. Upon USB pairing you're prompted to select the connection mode and you can then alternate the modes by only a few keypresses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory to be directly accessed from a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bluetooth version is 2.0 and it supports the A2DP profile to allow stereo wireless connection. The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - luckily the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte supports 3G for faster data transfers, as well as EDGE and GPRS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The obvious absentees here are the memory card slot, which is sometimes the most convenient way of transferring information, Wi-Fi and the Infrared port.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers: Opera Mini 4.2, please!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Gold Arte has two Web browsers straight out-of-the-box. The well-known S40 integrated WAP browser, which also manages HTML pages, has no significant changes in functionality and is almost identical to the one used in the Nokia Luna. Font size modifications are available as usual and when set to the smallest font, the display fits up to 11 text lines. Direct address entering is available too. The browsing experience with this application however is nowhere near the standard of the Nokia smartphone browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser faces serious competition from a brilliant application - the famous Opera Mini Java app - and it is definitely our first choice for web browsing on the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte. Nokia seem to share our view on this as they have placed a shortcut to Opera Mini right inside the Main menu, granting instant access to the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we are talking about the Opera Mini 4.2. The one we found preinstalled was 3.1 and we got rid of it the moment we saw it. There are significant improvements in the newer version and all of them make it worth downloading (it only takes a couple of mins). And we really do mean this. Now you can see web pages as you are used to seeing them on your PC. The Opera browser also has an extremely useful page overview function that enables you to zoom in on any part of it. p&gt;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini is by far the more intuitive application, and it resizes text much better than the default browser. If only the screen was a little bigger web-surfing would be an absolute dream on the Gold Arte.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer: the one we know and love<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte has undergone very little changes compared to the other S40 models. Not that it needs many, as it handles time-management almost perfectly. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are also five types of events available that can be set up: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Furthermore, each type of event has its own unique fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize your tasks into three priority levels. Tasks can be assigned an alert, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application. Text notes with a limit of 3000 characters are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. A nice added touch is the possibility to set the snooze alarm to any interval you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, there is a cool feature utilizing the built-in sensor that shows the clock when you shake the phone twice. It also works upon tapping the keypad cover twice if you prefer it this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all easily operable and decent looking. This time however, the calculator offers two different versions - a basic application and a scientific version with more functions available. An elaborate loan calculator is also at the user's disposal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Many applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Gold Arte has a decent set of preinstalled applications outside the organizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First in line is the size converter that provides quick conversions across various size standards. From shoes to shirts, everything is covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the unit converter. It offers all kinds of converting options, including currencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search application helps you find the piece of data you are looking for on your handset, while the download application takes you to the Nokia download center. There you can find a lot of useful stuff for your handset. The Gold Arte also includes the Widsets application, which is a group of web based applications that can be accessed at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a dictionary, which offers quick multilingual translations. Unfortunately, the word database is not that big, so don't expect too much of it. The world clock application that can tell you the current time in every spot of the world completes the list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A single game only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably feel disappointed with the Gold Arte's preloaded content. It features a single game - Golf Tour. Although it has acceptable graphics and decent gameplay, we aren't that impressed. Besides, we have seen it on dozens of handsets already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it is hard to imagine a Nokia 8800 Gold Arte owner fooling around playing games on their mobile. If they do however, even this fashion-conscious device can be turned into a portable gaming console with the dozens of compatible games available for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's the Arte series and you're more likely to want one than own one. We do. And we don't. End of story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no point going on and on about the market and pricing or the aesthetic value of the Arte handsets. There's no denying their seductive power or their inherent technical handicap. What you have is so hard - and so easy - to resist. So, suit yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile phones have long become a commodity and we guess there's no reason to be bitter with the Arte series for being among the last strongholds of luxury. And by the way, we believe the Nokia approach does more for the brand in the long run than the co-branding projects of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, having cheered every new addition to the Arte series, we can go ahead and say white leather on gold is hardly our favorite styling. But to some it may as well be the next best thing since a cruise in their own pleasure boat. And if it doesn't - there's always an option of getting something that has a more distinctive aura, if you get what we mean.</paragraph>
