			<paragraph>Stainless steel and OLED screen: there's no way a handset with that kind of features will ever blend in with the crowd of handsets. Add the hefty price tag and you got the high-end biting the dust too, just like that. But then, there's always someone like us to ruin the pleasure. Poking and prying, finding out if it's worth your dime. Wait a minute, did we say dime?! Sorry, we got carried away. Can't help it with the Nokia 8800 Arte.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has long stuck a pole into the ground of premium lifestyle. Ever since the original Nokia 8800 saw the light of day, the Finnish-based company has been the first choice for phones made of exclusive, highest quality materials. Exquisite and beautifully crafted, the 88xx series handsets will get away with anything, be it their underperformance or exorbitant price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Arte will face the greatest amount of competition inside its own pack, with every other 88xx-series handset a potential rival. Looks will be the weapons of choice, although the Arte duo has an ace up their sleeve in terms of functionality too. Nokia 8800 Arte and 8800 Sapphire Arte are the first 88xx series phones to feature 3G support. Anyway, the whole bunch is so heavy on design and exclusivity that high speed data transfers may as well be of no consequence if you're to make up your mind between the Arte and the Luna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The premium Nokia 8800 Arte brings along a fine bunch of accessories. And well deserved to the very last one of them, if you ask us, given the cost of the handset. Apart from the main ingredients - the phone and the battery - there is a whole bunch of other niceties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Bluetooth handsfree included, instead of a regular wired one. You also get a stylish leather carrying pouch and a stand charger. Not that you can't plug the charger cord directly into the phone but why not prop this piece of Arte up on your desk. It goes without saying that a microUSB cable and a DC charger are also in the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a whole lot of paper and a CD with the required software for syncing you phone with your PC.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 88xx models have always been valued for their design and high-quality construction. The Nokia 8800 Arte makes no exception, impressing with its sleek stainless steel covers and anti-fingerprint surface. Unfortunately, that was only used for the back panel leaving the front of the phone quite exposed to finger smudges. These however are only visible when looking at the phone from particular angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Arte stands at 109 x 45.6 x 14.6 mm with a volume of 65cc, which is pretty much the standard in this line of premium Nokia models starting with the original 8800. Weight however has been constantly growing with each new member of the Nokia VIP line. The Arte weighs as much as 150 grams, which is 7g more than the 8600 Luna and 12g more than the Sirocco edition of the 8800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we doubt it anyone would pay this much money if the phone was lighter or gave a cheap plastic feeling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a single color version of the Nokia 8800 Arte - it comes dressed in black, while the brown color is reserved for the 8800 Sapphire Arte, which starts selling as we speak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start the hardware inspection of Nokia 8800 Arte with the front panel. Dead center at the top we find the earpiece. The ambient light sensor is on its left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the earpiece is the 2" OLED display, which will receive its due attention later on in our review. Next in line are the D-pad and the surrounding four controls - the Call and End keys and the two selection keys. They are all large enough and comfortable to use and we had no problems with them for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open reveals the keypad, which also has a reserved spot later in our review. At this stage, we are only going to say that the phone does look better closed and the keypad hidden under the glossy surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of Nokia 8800 Arte hold very few functional elements. There is only a back cover release button on each of them and the loudspeaker on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power key is on the top of the phone and can also be used for changing the active profile. Unfortunately, due to its location, it is too exposed to accidental presses, especialy when putting the phone in the tight carrying pouch. We had quite a number of unwanted phone turn-offs for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of Nokia 8800 Arte hosts the microUSB slot and the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we reach the back cover where the main highlight is the 3 megapixel camera with autofocus. There is no flash so taking pictures in low light is not an option for Arte owners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover gets removed by pressing the two release buttons on the sides of the phone and pulling it down. Under it you will find the 1000 mAh battery, which is supposed to last 300 hours in stand-by or 3 hours of talk time. One thing for sure, battery life has improved compared to the Luna and especially the Sirocco. On the other hand, there is no spare battery in the retail package but we guess we simply can't have it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's easy to take high build quality for granted with the 88xx series. Nokia 8800 Arte is ? well, truly great. Exclusive, high quality materials have been used and it shows. The phone feels great in hand and the heavy weight makes things even better on this occasion. The sliding mechanism is also very well crafted, although the spring was a little too tight for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is also strong and smooth enough to allow easy operation of the phone in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Nokia 8800 Arte is sure comfortable. The terraced keys are large enough to ensure typo-free texting on this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys on the same row are a bit harder to distinguish so you might need some practice before you master it completely. There is also another issue with the keypad - the top row is situated too close to the rim of the slider and the metal frame does get in the way of working with the keys properly. Comparing the Arte keypad to the quite comfortable keyboard of Nokia N95 8GB, we conclude that Arte offers a tad better tactility, while N95 8GB is superior in terms of headroom for the top row of buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, we would rate the keypad of Nokia 8800 Arte adequate, though there is still some room for improvement. All the same, heavy texters are hardly the target here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of Nokia 8800 Arte is surely one of its most debated features. The main reason of course is the OLED technology used. Theoretically, it involves lower production costs and better power efficiency. The screens are thinner, easier to make and offer a far greater viewing angle, brightness and contrast, not to mention the faster response time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thinness and low power consumption make OLED screens especially suitable for portable devices. Already probing the TV display territory, the OLED technology is still far from full swing and the reason is the still inferior lifetime of OLED materials. However there are good chances that the Organic LED technology will be replacing the LCD one in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that said, there are a few things nudging us about the Nokia 8800 Arte display. The low sunlight legibility is probably the most obvious problem, to the extent that it actually renders the phone almost impossible to use in bright sunlight. The great picture quality can only be enjoyed indoors or on cloudy days but then the OLED is simply great. The pitch black is far above the capabilities of any LCD and same goes true for the contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another flaw of the display is its size. For a phone in this price range we find 2" inadequate, OLED or else. Yet, as more of a fashion gadget the phone was probably never intended to win the hearts of the tech-freaks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is uncompromised<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just as we expected the signal reception and call quality are in line with the Nokia 8800 Arte high standing. Calls are loud and clear on both ends eliminating any possible obstacles to communication.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, many can consider the lack of video calls a real disappointment. It feels the 3G support is not used to the maximum. Not that video calling is something we cannot live without but it sure wouldn't hurt having it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great new feature of Nokia 8800 Arte is the turn-to-mute functionality. It allows muting the phone during a call or hushing the alarm by simply flipping the device over. Here is a video that should give you an idea of exactly how it works.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the front pannel down mutes the incomming call of Nokia 8800 Arte</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 8800 Arte ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. It surely doesn't have the loudest voice around but there aren't many occasions you will miss a call with the Arte. You can find more info about the test itself, as well as results from other tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Series 40, 5th edition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you expected Nokia 8800 Arte to bring some great surprises softwarewise, you will end up disappointed. It employs the Series 40 5th edition user interface with navigation and control almost the same as with the previous UI edition, used in the Nokia 8600 Luna. The Arte offers a large number of configurable options but at the cost of a little complicated menu structure and navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in stand-by, the display as usually visualizes the pre-selected wallpaper plus signal strength, battery status and time in the top bar. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the labels of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn active standby on if you want. It consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated according to the user's preferences. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom events from the calendar are displayed set for the current day. A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two soft keys' functionality can also be altered if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 8800 Arte can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons our personal choice remains the typical grid view with legends. If you prefer more icons to appear simultaneously, you can go for the grid view without text, as it displays a 4 x 3 icons grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons of the main menu can be freely reordered to suit the user's taste. An interesting thing to note here is that the Opera Mini browser, the calculator and the WidSets application can be found directly in the main menu. They are also featured in the applications folder so, basically, you can access them from wherever you prefer. Probably these three were considered important enough to place in the main menu for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus follow no consistent pattern. Some items have captions, others do not. In certain cases, you will even be able to see the selected item described in small font, so you will not need to step further into another menu level. As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keypad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lagging or holdups. This is the case with basically any S40 device nowadays and we wouldn't expect any less from the Arte. Also, there were no halts or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Themes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Heavy on looks inside out, the Nokia 8800 Arte comes with six preinstalled themes. All of them are quite up to the task with their conservative styling. You can of course download additional themes, which are available all over the internet. There are even some that produce sounds on certain events, such as opening or closing the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are as many as five predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 8800 Arte, plus a Flight mode, which turns off all transceivers on the device. That number should be enough to have you covered in practically any circumstances. The flight mode can turn out very convenient if you decide to use your phone as an MP3 player and it can be used without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 8800 Arte offers space for up to 1000 contacts and extensive configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but unluckily the phone numbers are limited to 5. Also, first names are separated from last names eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. The picture displayed is different for incoming and outgoing calls, as it fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and only take a small part of it when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contacts: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. The phonebook font size can also be enlarged to make reading you contacts easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is done by gradual typing of the name of a contact. And that's not all: contacts can also be organized in groups and these can consequently be used as call filters. Another praiseworthy application is the voice dial, which requires no pre-recording of the commands and phonebook names. It is even equipped with a training application that helps for better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 8800 Arte won't surprise anyone who has ever held a Series 40 device in their hands. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them together. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Message menu of Nokia 8800 Arte is organized almost perfectly. The handset is capable of handling practically any type of message - SMS, EMS, MMS and e-mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three types share an editor and all you need to convert an SMS to an EMS or MMS is apply text formatting or insert any multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to set a contact as favorite for messaging in case you have frequent correspondence with one and the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. It goes without saying that the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will be divided into constantly visible. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. MMS size limit for both send and receive is 300 KB. The best part is that the phone will automatically scale down pictures for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really good stuff. It automatically adjusts its settings once you enter your email address and than all you need to do is enter your username and password. No more time wasted on trying to get a long list of settings right for the client to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes. When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Outgoing attachments are not limited in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client downloads the headers and then offers to download the entire body of the messages you need. You can also set the messages to be automatically downloaded in full if traffic is no problem for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is really nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in Nokia 8800 Arte is identical to the one found in Nokia 7900 Prism. Looks have improved looks over the Nokia 6500 classic for example, but all remains unchanged featurewise. The music player sorts songs by artist, album and genre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player works with MP3, MIDI, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. The supported A2DP profile allows listening on Bluetooth wireless earphones. The player looks can be changed to the classical skin if that suits the user better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset uses the microUSB jack for connecting a headset, so finding a set of headphones for listening to music may just turn out very hard. Anyway you are not very likely to listen to tons of music on your Arte anyway. Besides you can always use the Bluetooth handsfree for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience of the player is enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. Nokia 8800 Arte has only one loudspeaker located on the side, right next to the camera. We did already mention that we weren't impressed by its performance at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, we have to mention that it does not get muffled at all when the phone body is placed on its back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no FM radio on Nokia 8800 Arte, which the Luna for example used to have. So if you get bored with the music player all you can do is turn the video on. The video player is compatible with the 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode is nice and generally improves video watching.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery needs improvement<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We personally aren't great fans of how the gallery looks in Series 40 models. The fact that it also acts as a file manager somewhat damages its user-friendliness and looks. For example you do need a few extra presses to get to your music files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery relies on your putting the right type of files in the right folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest thing around and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures can also be viewed in fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter however offers very limited options, but considering the fact that there are very few users that actually use a picture editor on their phones, this is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter can be quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders. Nonetheless, the gallery on Series 40 devices could be improved a lot. That goes true especially in user friendliness and we do hope that sometime in the future the file manager and the gallery of these phones will be separate applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Below average 3 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Arte is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera with autofocus. It may not be the most impressive in terms of specifications, but is surely the best among the Nokia premium mobiles. Typical of Series 40, the camera settings are few, but that makes them simpler and easier to use. The settings include white balance, three photo quality options going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unluckily, as mentioned, there is no flash on the device, which makes photos in low light conditions unusable. Even in good conditions the photo quality is not be on par with the best 3 megapixel cameraphones such as the Sony Ericsson K810. In general the detail is high, but the colors are oversaturated and the noise levels are high not only in the shadow areas, but in the well lit ones too. Just look at the skies from the samples below and you will get the idea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two letdowns about the camera that are not directly related to picture quality. The first is the absence of lens cover. The Nokia 8800 Arte's camera only relies on the fact that it is a tad sunk in the surface to avoid scratches. We don't find that enough for such a phone but the Nokia R&amp;D team probably though that lens protection would ruin the design. Anyway, this is maybe the best reason to carry your phone around in the leather case that comes in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated camera button is another real disappointment when it comes to operating the camera. It is quite uncomfortable, especially when shooting in landscape mode, to use the confirm button of the D-pad for that purpose. Besides, the function of the capture key changes to delete once a photo is taken which we don't quite understand. Although erasing a photo by accident is very unlikely, as confirmation is still required, we can't help wishing the Nokia designers did better here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally a few words about the camera speed. Nokia 8800 Arte is about as fast as the senior member of the prism family - the Nokia 7900. This means that it's a decent performer and it won't take ages to take a photo. Still, don't expect it to be as quick as the Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot phones. After all, the Arte doesn't presume to be a cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Arte also manages video recording. It can capture videos in VGA resolution, which is a great achievement. The frame rate is only 15fps and that is quite a downer, but nevertheless, on most occasions videos turn out nice. The videos are captured in 3GP format and their length is only limited by the free memory available. All in all, the Nokia 8800 Arte offers a very good performance for a non-cameraphone. Here is a sample video, so you check for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: Good all-rounder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is decently covered in Nokia 8800 Arte. The main focus here is USB and it is really seamless. Upon USB pairing you're prompted to select the connection mode. You can then alternate the modes by only a few keypresses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory to be directly accessed from a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bluetooth version is 2.0 and it supports the A2DP profile, which allows stereo wireless connection. The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - luckily Nokia 8800 Arte supports 3G for faster data transfers, as well as EDGE and GPRS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The obvious absence here is the memory card slot, which is sometimes the most convenient way of transferring information, Wi-Fi and the Infrared port.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers: Opera Mini does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Arte has two Web browsers straight out-of-the-box. The well-known S40 integrated WAP browser, which also manages HTML pages, has no significant changes in functionality and is almost identical to the one used in the Nokia Luna. Font size modifications are available, as usual. When set to the smallest font, the display visualizes up to 11 text lines. Direct address entering is available too. The browsing experience with this application however is nowhere near the standard of Nokia smartphone browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser faces serious competition from another brilliant application - the famous Opera Mini Java application. The latter is pre-installed and is definitely our first choice for browsing the web on Nokia 8800 Arte. Besides, Nokia seem to share this point of view as they have placed a shortcut to Opera Mini right in the Main menu, facilitating access to the browser. Opera Mini is by far the more intuitive application, fitting text better than the integrated browser. If only the screen was a little bigger web-surfing would have probably been absolutely great with the Arte. It is still on a decent level as it is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer: time-proven performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of Nokia 8800 Arte has undergone very little changes when compared to the other S40 models. Not that it needs many, as it is handling time-management almost perfectly. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are also five types of events available for setting up: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own unique fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize you tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application. Text notes are available as well; their length limit is 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. A nice touch to it is the possibility to set the snooze time to any period you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, there is a cool feature utilizing the built-in sensor that shows the clock when you shake the phone twice. It also works upon tapping the keypad cover twice but this way isn't as smooth. Check out the video showing how this feature actually works.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clock pops up while shaking or tapping the Nokia 8800 Arte</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all easily operable and decently looking. This time however, the calculator offers two different versions - a basic application and a scientific version with more functions available. An elaborate loan calculator is also at the user's disposal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Arte has a decent set of preinstalled applications outside the organizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First in line is the size converter that provides quick conversions across various size standards. From shoes to shirts, everything is covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there goes the unit converter. It offers all kinds of converting options, including currency conversion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search application helps you find the piece of data you are looking for on you handset, while the download application takes you to the Nokia download center. There you are going to find a lot of useful stuff for your handset. The WidSets application is also at Nokia 8800 Arte owners' disposal. It represents a group of web based applications that can be accessed at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a dictionary, which offers quick multilingual translations. Unfortunately, the word database is not that large, so don't expect too much of it. The world clock application that can tell you the current time in every spot of the world completes the list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the games begin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably feel disappointed with the Nokia 8800 Arte preloaded content. It features a single game - Golf Tour. Although it has acceptable graphics and decent gameplay, we weren't amazed with it. Besides, we have seen it on dozens of handsets already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it is hard to imagine a Nokia 8800 Arte owner fooling around playing games on their mobile. Now, even this design-centered device can be turned into a portable gaming console with the dozens of compatible games available for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words - flaunt it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>However tempted we are to call the Arte underpowered, we know better than messing with 150 grams of solid steel. Plus, is it just us or is the Arte adding some purpose to the 88xx series with UMTS? Oops, talking about functionality is actually an offense to the Arte and its likes. Nokia 8800 Arte is really exquisite and expensive, and it shows. And that's a good enough reason for the people who favor looks over performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparing the Arte to other handsets will be missing the point. Looking back to the Sirocco and the Luna, we can't help thinking that inevitably losing a fraction of their price with time, they lose a huge amount of appeal. It's just how things are in the small niche of mobile haute couture where Arte and Luna rub shoulders with Armani and Prada. Common sense is for the common folk.</paragraph>
