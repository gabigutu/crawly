			<paragraph>IFA 2012 is in full swing with countless devices on display. With the headliners fully covered, it's time to take a closer look at the many cool devices that the not-so-popular manufacturers have on display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the enormous IFA showroom floor we spent some time at the booths of ZTE, HTC, LG and Acer all of which had pretty interesting smartphones on display. Windows 8-running tablets and notebooks from Toshiba, Archos, Lenovo and HP made really strong impression as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're still tirelessly roaming the IFA floors in search of new devices and we'll be posting them here as soon as we have our hands on them. Make sure you keep an eye on this space, as we'll be updating the article with new info as it becomes available.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>ZTE just announced its first ever smartphone powered by an Intel chip. The ZTE Grand X IN is running on the Atom Z2460, which is a single-core CPU operating at 1.6GHz bundled with Intel's Graphics Media Accelerator running at 400MHz and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3-inch LCD display at the front boasts a resolution of 960x540 pixels and is well saturated with good brightness. Viewing angles are above average for a display of this type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Grand X IN runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich pretty effortlessly and Intel's Smart Idle Technology should help the modest 1650mAh battery keep the party going for at least a day of work and play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is made entirely out of plastic and feels nice to touch. The grippy pattern on the back panel helps for securely holding the phone in hand. It's not the most lightweight smartphone out there weighing 140.8 grams, but its relatively compact measuring 127 x 65 x 9.9 mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, there's an 8MP camera with LED flash, complete with a 0.3MP front snapper. In-built storage is 16GB, expandable by up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. NFC connectivity, Dolby Sound, FM Radio, DLNA and HD Voice with dual microphones round up the specs sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Grand X IN launches in September debuting in Greece and Hungary, and Germany later on. The smartphone's unsubsidized price is expected to be around ?300, but carriers such as T-Mobile Germany will be offering it for much less on a contract.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Acer announced two new Liquids just days before the IFA kicks in. Also, the company just brought to the market its FullHD LCD-packing Tegra 3-powered Iconia Tab A700 Android tablet, so we just had to stop and see what those are all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here we are, at Acer's booth trying to get to know the new Acer lineup a little better. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Gallant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As it turns out the Acer Liquid Gallant is a nice looking, but underpowered mid-ranger packing a 1GHz single-core processor, 1GB RAM, 4GB storage and the usual connectivity extras. The phone uses a 4.3-inch HD capacitive touchscreen and runs on Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had the pleasure to play with the Ceramic White unit and we have to say it looks really sweet. In addition to the matte battery cover Acer's added a few metallic plates as well. That way the phone looks way better than you would expect from a handset in its price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Gallant lacks glossy parts (besides the screen glass, of course), fingerprints are mostly out of the question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Cloud Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ICS-running Cloud Mobile was also showcased at Acer's booth. The smartphone was announced back in February, but it's just now that we see it in action. It runs on a 1.5GHz dual-core processor and features a 4.3-inch 720p display, an 8MP camera and good connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting design decision was to put the power on/off key on the back of the device right next to the camera lens. It's a really convenient spot actually, but we guess that camera lens would need cleaning more often than not.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Iconia Tab A700<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, the star of the show - the Iconia Tab A700 slate. It's based on NVIDIA's Tegra 3 quad-core platform and utilizes a 10.1-inch Full HD display. The tablet arrived on the market just this month and it's surely worth checking out.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Lenovo is offering several new tablets at this years' IFA, and we've decided to give you the quick lowdown on each of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IdeaTab A2107, IdeaTab A2109, and IdeaTab S2110 are all Android ICS tablets designed for various market segments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>IdeaTab S2110 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The IdeaTab S2110 is Lenovo's new premium 10-inch tablet, featuring a detachable keyboard dock. Inside, there's a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 32 GB of storage and 1 GB of RAM. There's also connectivity for USB devices, a microHDMI port, 3G connectivity, and 5 MP rear-facing and 1.3 MP front-facing cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the S2110 is definitely the best of the three, and the back is adequately grippy although not as smudge-resistant as the two other tablets. The device becomes significantly heavier when the keyboard is attached, but as a standalone tablet it weighs in pretty well. The 1280 x 800 display is by far the best of the three, and navigation the Android interface is very snappy with no lag in the animations or transitions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>IdeaTab A2109 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The IdeaTab A2109 is a slightly smaller and less robust version of the S2110, sans the keyboard attachment. The 9â?? display features the same 1280 x 800 pixel display, while inside you'll find a quad-core Tegra 3 processor clocked in at 1.2GHz. The A2109 doesn't feature the 3G connectivity of the other two tablets, but it does have a microHDMI port and the usual array of connectivity features. There's also a 3MP/1.3MP front/rear camera combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the S2110, the screen is sharp and has a good brightness, but the viewing angles leave something to be desired. The construction is similar to that of the A2107, and it features the same fingerprint-resistant back panel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>IdeaTab A2107 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, the IdeaTab A2107 is Lenovo's new budget Android offering, with a 7" screen of 1024 x 600 pixels resolution. It's powered by a 1GHz processor, and has 16 GB of internal storage alongside 1 GB of RAM. There's also Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a microSD card slot, and 3G connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device's 1GHz processor had a hard time keeping up with what we tried to do, and the screen's viewing angles were not the best either. The WSVGA resolution makes the the UI look not as sharp as on the other two devices, which we were not expecting, considering the Lenovo press release claims a 720p screen resoltuon. The back was nicely-textured so as to be resistant to fingerprints. and when removing the back panel we were surprised to see slots for two SIM cards - something that's not advertized by Lenovo for this device.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Desire X got to spend some quality time with our IFA 2012 ninjas and we've got the pictures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is HTC's latest midrange offering and features a 4â?? Super LCD at the front, a 5 MP snapper on the back, Android ICS 4.0.4 with the latest Sense 4.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels nice and firm in the hands. The display looks sharp with good viewing angles. The Desire X feels very slim with tapered edges, which make it feel even slimmer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone handles well with no major hiccups. Still we got the feel that Sense 4.1 is slightly heavy for the dual-core 1 GHz processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metalic-like rim around the display gives the Desire X a premium look and the smartphone feels miles ahead of the Desire C in terms of build quality. The plastic on the back of the Desire X is smooth and has a nice feel to it thanks to the matte finish.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HP's most interesting announcement at IFA this year is the Envy X2 - a Windows 8-based tablet with a keyboard dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Envy X2 slate features an 11.6-inch IPS touchscreen with 400-nit brightness and 1366x768px resolution. It's powered by Intel's Clover Trail processor and comes with 8MP camera and 64GB internal memory. There is support for Beats Audio as well. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Envy X2 body and dock are made entirely of aluminum giving everything a premium look. The keyboard dock weighs about 725 grams and packs an additional battery, 2xUSB ports, an HDMI TV-out and an SD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slate itself weighs a bit less - about 680 grams which is even more impressive given the solid aluminum shell and the size of the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP Envy X2 has "an innovative hinge with magnets that smoothly guide the tablet into place" and we can confirm indeed that the slate fits easily into the dock and you'll have no problem using it as a laptop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP targets the Envy X2 release for this year's holiday season, but the pricing is yet to be announced.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Archos booth was one of the stops during our tour around the IFA expo grounds and we got to see the newly announced Archos 101 XS slate in person and take a few live shots of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ICS-powered Archos 101 XS has a 10.1" 1280 x 800 display and is powered by the TI OMAP 4470 chipest, featuring a dual core CPU and the PowerVR SGX544 GPU. According to the company it should get its Jelly Bean serving by the end of the year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside there are 16 GB of on-board storage with microSD card support up to 64 GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 101 XS has a mini HDMI on the left side along with a microUSB and 3.5 mm headphones jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard dock, dubbed Coverboard, attaches to the Archos 101 XS magnetically and features a full QWERTY and home, back and task switcher buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard dock can actually be used as a case for the tablet as it fits perfectly face down on the keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 101 XS will hit the US in November for $400 with the keyboard dock in place.</paragraph>

			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device features a 12.5-inch IPS touch display (up to 5 fingers) with 1366 x 768 resolution and you can choose between Intel Core i3 or i5 internals. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top specs you can opt for go as high as a 256GB SSD for its main drive and up to 8GB DDR3 of RAM. The rest of the features include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, HDMI port, compass, gyroscope and an ambient-light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Toshiba Satellite U920T weighs about 1.45 kg and is 19.9mm thick. The 128GB SSD version of the U920T will cost ?940, and availability should coincide with the Windows 8 launch in the end of November.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to get out hands on the device and we are really pleased with its build quality. The materials used all seem to be of high quality and the ultrabook feels really good in hands. It's really light for a laptop and is a pleasure to use. It's definitely a device to look forward to if you are into the convertibles.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9, which was announced at the IFA, is a mid-ranger that aims to bring solid smartphone functionality, good styling and reasonable price tag under one roof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 fella is a home to a 4.7-inch qHD IPS display, a 1GHz dual-core processor, a 5MP camera and 4GB internal storage. 
 We find the screen to have pretty good image quality and sharpness even though it's 234ppi density isn't the best in class. The viewing angles are above average, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the specs include 1GB of RAM, front-facing VGA camera for video chats and a standard connectivity package. It runs on Android 4.0 ICS skinned with LG?s custom Optimus UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of controls the LG Optimus L9 is quite similar to the high-flying Optimus 4X HD ? the form factor is the same and so are the keys at the front controls (except the Home key, which is now regular button rather than touch-sensitive one), the side bezel and even the textured thin plastic battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 should hit the shelves by the end of the year, costing you about ?340 contract-free.</paragraph>
