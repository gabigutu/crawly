			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom speeds down right onto our review track, ready to take on any cameraphone contender. This speedster is equipped with a 10x optical zoom and OIS and if you were to see only its back, you would hardly recognize you are staring at an Android smartphone with a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED screen on the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Galaxy Camera didn't have phone functionality and was way too big for comfort. The Galaxy S4 zoom's specs were too low-end to deserve the "Galaxy S" badge. The Galaxy K zoom is reasonably sized (about as big as a Galaxy S4, except thicker and heavier) and offers solid midrange specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The days of taking several photos and handing over the roll at the local shop to be developed are long gone, these days a photo must be seen - and shared - the moment it has been snapped. There's more than a few social networks and services that change so often that even so-called "smart cameras" can't keep up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is half of the reason smartphones have displaced traditional cameras - posting on Instagram / Snapchat / Vine is a lot more common than collecting photos in a family album. The other half is just not having to deal with two devices - did you take the camera? Did you charge the battery, did you offload the photos?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just using the "good enough" camera on your smartphone solves those issues but you lose the zoom and OIS even a cheap a point-and-shoot offers and the flash is usually a weakling LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom offers the best of both worlds - it's an Android smartphone and it's a camera. The cost you'd pay is the increased thickness and weight but it still takes less space than a stand-alone camera and a phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung Galaxy K zoom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Samsung Galaxy K zoom does not give away its special nature. The box itself is small, no bigger than that of a regular Galaxy phone and it contains the same peripherals too. There's a charger, a separate microUSB cable and a one-piece headset with extra rubber tips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no camera-specific accessories, not that there's much you can add to the Galaxy K zoom (unlike the Galaxy S4 zoom, there's no tripod mount on the side of this one).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy K zoom 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom measures 137.5 x 70.8 x 16.6mm and weighs 200g. The last two numbers are the problem - a Galaxy S III, which had the same screen, measures 136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6mm and weighs 133g. So the 10x optical zoom camera nearly doubles the thickness and adds 70g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone half of the Samsung Galaxy K zoom looks like just that, a phone, a spitting image of a Galaxy S5. The only change Samsung made is the inclusion of a prominent two-stage shutter key on the right side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera half looks phone-like too with a rounded back covered with faux perforated leather. It's not everyone's favorite finish but it's some of the best Samsung has worked with recently and, on a more practical note, it's grippy and doesn't collect fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom was officially 15.4mm thick, but that didn't include the protruding grip on one end and the large camera module on the other. That module had an active rotating ring to control the camera functions, but the Galaxy K zoom relies on just the shutter key and volume rocker to aid the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of, the shutter key is long and quite big making it very comfortable to use. The S4 zoom had a flush, round shutter key, which wasn't all that great. The volume rocker serves as a zoom lever in the absence of the active ring (there are on-screen controls too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also abandoned the DSLR-inspired ring UI on the camera and use the same clean interface found on the Galaxy S5. This makes manual controls finicky and hard to use, we guess Samsung decided that the target audience for the Galaxy K zoom is unlikely to fiddle with shutter speed and ISO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead the company distilled the knowledge of a photographer into the Pro suggest mode - the camera will automatically suggest several presets that are appropriate for the scene and let you chose the best one. All these modes are available for manual selection too and are descriptive enough to help you pick the right one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key and the volume rocker/zoom lever are conveniently positioned for the usual camera grip, easily reachable with your index fingers. The on-screen buttons positioned on the left and right columns of the screen are equally easy to reach with your thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 200g of weight the Galaxy K zoom is well above the average weight for a smartphone, but the volume of the device is such that it doesn't feel heavy. The weight balance is shifted slightly to the left, towards the camera module, but not enough to affect handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The material on the back is grippy and the panel itself is actually thicker than it could have been, the extra thickness forms the curve of the back. This evens out the difference between the camera module and the rest of the phone, which makes holding it vertically - as a phone - more comfortable (the Galaxy S4 zoom was rather unpleasant in this regard).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom borrows the 4.8" screen of the Galaxy S III. It's a Super AMOLED display of 720p resolution and 306ppi pixel density. The Gorilla Glass protecting the display has been upped to version 3 for extra durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has a PenTile matrix and if you look closely you'll notice the characteristic crosshatch pattern. It takes a trained eye to spot it though and it's most visible in high-contrast areas (e.g. black and white text), it's practically impossible to spot in photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Super AMOLEDs are great for camera screens - the spectacular contrast and vivid colors are a boon for sure, but Samsung screens usually boast great sunlight legibility too and the Galaxy K zoom screen is no exception. Since your screen is your viewfinder framing the shot can be hard with a common LCD that appears washed out at an angle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>That said, the screen is a bit behind the times and doesn't offer the most accurate colors (like the Galaxy S5 screen does). As we saw in the previous chapter, Samsung is targeting the K zoom at a more casual crowd that can't be bothered with a true to sRGB screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are great and so are the colors if you don't mind the slight oversaturation. Samsung could have included the Screen mode option to let you adjust color saturation but they didn't.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The controls of the phone are entirely phone-centric. The front features Samsung's button arrangement below the screen, a hardware Home key and capacitive App switcher and Back buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the earpiece, sensors and a front-facing 2MP camera. You need to be mindful of the front-facing camera when shooting selfies with the phone held horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side (which becomes the top side when you use the Galaxy K zoom as a camera) is the big, comfortable shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: As our readers pointed out there is a way to launch the camera from the locksreen but you need to press and hold both the shutter key and the volume up key, not all that convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to tap the Power key and unlock the device with the camera shortcut to start the camera. The volume rocker is above the Power key and doubles as a zoom lever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left / bottom side of the K zoom is the microSD card slot under a protective flap, hot-swapping cards is easy. Also here is the lanyard eyelet but the tripod mount from the Galaxy S4 zoom has been dropped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is what sets the Galaxy K zoom apart from other devices - a prominent camera module protrudes from the back. There is glass covering the internals of the lens but you should still be careful when putting the phone on a rough surface as scratches on that glass can affect image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scratches on the rest of the module are just cosmetic damage, but unfortunately, we got an extraordinary amount of those in just a few short days. When lying on its back, the Galaxy K zoom lies exactly on the lens ring and the lens ring on our review unit was covered all over with scratches in no time even though we took good care of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the S4 Zoom, you can't rotate the lens ring. The zoom operation is handled exclusively by the side volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom back houses a powerful (by phone standards) xenon flash accompanied by a red focus assist LED. The loudspeaker grille is on the other side of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side of the device is home to the microUSB port (which doubles as TV-Out port thanks to MHL 1.3), while the 3.5mm audio jack is on top. Each side also has a mic used for calls and stereo sound capture in videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's noise reduction for both, including wind noise reduction and quiet zoom. Quiet zoom eliminates the noise from the zooming mechanism during video recording.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom has a rich connectivity package. This includes Cat. 4 LTE-A for up to 150Mbps of download speeds and 50Mbps worth of upload. Outside of 4G coverage you get 42Mbps downlink from quad-band 3G HSPA and there's quad-band 2G as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 LE. The LE standard is used in some sports accessories though others require ANT+, which is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port supports USB On-the-go for hooking up external storage and MHL 1.3 for outputting HD video. You'll need the appropriate adapter for each of these. The other wired adapter is a standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom supports NFC for quick pairing with other devices and reading NFC tags. The only thing missing is an IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final piece of the connectivity puzzle is A-GPS for positioning, GLONASS is supported as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom packs a relatively large 2,430mAh battery, that's some 100mAh more than what the Galaxy S4 zoom had. The K zoom is quite thick and heavy (by smartphone standards) but most of that is from the camera module, not the battery. Keep in mind that most point-and-shoot cameras have much smaller batteries but they don't have so many radios or CPU-hungry apps to feed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Galaxy K zoom posted excellent standby power draw and it did very well in the call test - despite its camera looks, it's a proper phone too. The web browsing time is a respectable 9 hours too and you'll be able to get over 10 hours of video playback, enough to see all the footage you've shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life of the Samsung Galaxy K zoom is examined in more detail on our blog. If you are curious about how the test itself is performed, this page has the answer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We start off the software tour of the Samsung Galaxy K zoom with the camera. We thought it's a good idea to skip straight to camera as it's the key selling feature of this device. But don't you worry, you would find all the relevant parts of the software review following right after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom comes with the camera of a mid-range point-and-shoot. It has a 1/2.3" sensor with 20.7MP resolution. The camera has a wide-angle lens, 24mm in 35mm equivalent, and features 10x optical zoom with aperture ranging from ranging from f/3.1 to f/6.3 (reached at 8.1x zoom). You have the option to close the aperture (down to f/9 at 24mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For zooming, the lens gets you to 10x magnification, while digital zoom pushes that to 20x. Generally, we're against digital zoom, but that's effectively 2x digital so we'll give it a shot - we've been pleasantly surprised before, especially when zooming during video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a powerful xenon flash available plus a focus assist LED for low-light scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two mics are used for audio capture and you have noise cancellation options - one to cut down wind noise and the other to eliminate noise from the zooming mechanism when shooting video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of video, the Galaxy K zoom can record video at up to 1080p resolution and for all resolution options you get a choice between 30fps and 60fps. Multimotion lets you slow down or speed up time by up to 8 times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom interface is very clean with most option concentrated in the Modes button. The whole laundry list of options may take a while to discover as in true Samsung fashion the camera app is chock full of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each mode, you get a selection of settings in the left column of the interface. You can drag up to three icons out to be easily accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of modes is indeed very long and most options are hidden by default, you have to hit the Manage modes button to select which options are visible and which are hidden. The Pro Suggest mode can act as a sort of shortcut, guessing which mode will be appropriate for the current scene and offering you the 5 best matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, Pro Suggest can be used to access My films. Films are camera effect presets that can be downloaded from an online store where users can upload their own film and presets. You can create custom Pro suggest presets too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shot &amp; More is another auto mode. It's a version of burst shot that automatically looks for certain possible effects. Best photo is always available, Best face shows up when there's a person in the frame. More advanced effects let you erase moving objects or clone them. You can select a mode as soon as you take the photo or you can go back to it later in the Studio app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selfie alarm lets you shoot selfies with the main 20MP camera, not the meager 2MP front-facing snapper. You adjust a rectangle in the shot (this is where you want your face to be) and turn the phone around to face the back camera. You'll hear a sound prompt when the framing is right and after three seconds the Galaxy K zoom will snap a series of three photos and automatically select the best one (but you can also override this selection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Beauty face isn't available for selfies, but it's a separate mode for taking portraits. It has a slider ranging from 0 to 5 for the strength of the effect and it removes wrinkles and generally touches up faces it detects in the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An easy way to take selfies from afar is to enable Remote viewfinder. You'll need a separate smartphone with the Remote viewfinder app. The second phone will connect to the Galaxy K zoom over Wi-Fi and serve as a wireless viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are a selection of panorama modes. The basic sweep panorama is available but you can also shoot spherical panoramas (think Google Street View) and Virtual tours. Virtual tours are not fixed to one location like the other two panorama modes but you can instead walk around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A number of effects also help you with shooting against bright light. There's the standard HDR mode, but you can also do Silhouette shots, Dawn and Sunset shots, snowy landscapes to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To personalize photos, you can add a signature to them - you create a signature image with your finger and then pick where it should be applied (in which corner).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get Program and Manual modes. Program lets you adjust the Exposure compensation and ISO settings while the aperture and shutter speed are selected automatically. Manual mode makes the Exposure compensation automatic but makes the shutter speed and aperture settings available for manual control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the current settings listed on the top row of the display and you can tap an available setting to change it. Instead of the big, thumbable rings of the Galaxy S4 zoom camera UI you get a small, one row slider that isn't very comfortable to control. You get slightly bigger controls and a few more options in the Settings menu (including automatic exposure bracketing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shutter speed can vary from 1/1200s to 16s, the Aperture is either f/3.1 or f/9 (those values go up as you zoom in), Exposure compensation goes from -2.0EV to +2.0EV and finally ISO can be cranked from a minimum of 100 to 3,200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that you're all ready to go and take some photos, you can enable the Photo Suggest feature to view a map with the best photos from Panoramio to find cool locations to shoot nearby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One last thing before we jump into the image quality - the Samsung Galaxy K zoom has 8GB of built-in storage and by the time the OS and pre-installed apps have taken their share, you're left with just under 4GB. During our tests we shot around full resolution 260 photos and about 25 short videos (20-30 seconds) and had 700MB or so storage left free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That is to say you can certainly use the K zoom without a microSD card but if you're going to record a lot of videos you'll need one. Don't forget that apps (games especially) can quickly eat into the storage too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Samsung Galaxy K zoom camera is good by smartphone standards but not perfect. The noise levels are kept in check though photos aren't as sharp as you would get out of the Galaxy S5. That said, the colors are more accurate (the S5 has a tendency to overexpose) and the white balance is spot on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lens has impressive zoom prowess for sure, but that comes at a price. There's noticeable corner softness and barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom lens .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in slightly reduces some of the corner softness and the optical distortion, so you shouldn't be afraid to use the best feature of the Galaxy K zoom camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical image stabilization is great, it can soak up the vibrations of even very shaky hands and keep the image rock steady at even 10x zoom (20x too if you enable digital zoom).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digital zoom gets you a step closer to your subject at the cost of dropping image quality. With 20.7MP there's enough detail to spare and unless you're going to view photos at 100% you can use the digital zoom for those times when the optical zoom doesn't get you close enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enabling HDR mode noticeably brightens up the shadows without a noticeable drop in image quality, but the highlights tend to get slightly washed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stitching on sweep panoramas proved very accurate though the final resolution was a bit disappointing. Depending on how you hold the Samsung Galaxy K zoom (horizontally or vertically) you get either 1000px or 2000px resolution in the vertical direction. That's enough to fill an HDTV, but we got used to the whopping 60MP panoramas produced by the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We shot the three charts with a slight zoom as all cameras distort the image at the wide end. Phones have a fixed focal length but the Galaxy K zoom is more flexible in this regard..</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom has two main video modes - 30fps and 60fps. You'll probably be doing most of your shooting at 1080p, but you can drop down to 720p if you're concerned about file size, e.g. if it's a video you intent to send as a file rather than upload to a video sharing service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, popular video sharing services such as YouTube and Vimeo only support 30fps videos so showing off your 60fps footage will be quite limited as an option. YouTube recently announced they would offer native 60fps playback, but that feature hasn't rolled out for everybody yet (us included).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, 1080p @ 30fps videos are captured at 17Mbps bitrate (the same as the Galaxy S5) with two-channel audio with 256Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. 1080p @ 60fps videos bumps the total bitrate to 28Mbps as quite as expected the number of frames doubles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put that into easier to understand numbers, half a minute of 1080p @ 60fps eats up 100MB of storage. 30fps videos take up around 65MB instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos hold the framerate steady with no dips but in 30fps videos you'll notice some choppiness with fast moving objects. That is inevitable and the reason 60fps exists - fast motion looks a lot more fluid, so depending on the scene the extra storage may well be worth it (as long as you keep in mind that YouTube will downconvert them to 30fps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have no visible noise and the amount of fine detail is good, though we've seen sharper videos (again the Galaxy S5 comes to mind). The softness becomes especially noticeable near the borders of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range isn't great either, the Galaxy K zoom under-develops shadows and keeps highlights artificially low so it doesn't use the full dynamic range of the video format. The result is that bright areas (e.g. clouds) look blown out even though they aren't at maximum brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download a 1080p @ 60fps sample since we couldn't host it on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the optical image stabilization of the Galaxy K zoom to the test:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here it is but this time with 10x zoom to make things harder:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's one more zoom video. It stops at 10x (the limit of optical zoom) and then again at 20x (maximum zoom). Also this was shot on a quiet terrace so try and listen for noise from the zoom mechanism:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Latest TouchWiz on KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box, a couple of minor versions behind current, but it's heavily customized by the most recent incarnation of TouchWiz. It's essentially the same software that runs on the Galaxy S5 except for the features without the corresponding hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows the time (with a dual clock option), date and weather. There's a camera shortcut but no widgets. As we mentioned in the hardware section, the camera shutter key cannot be used to unlock the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen features the My Magazine that displays both news articles and social networking updates. This is powered by Flipboard and you can enjoy your reads in a clean interface and send links to your friends or post social updates straight from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Categories (e.g. News, Business, Travel) are displayed as tiles, each displaying its top article. Updates from social networks can also be displayed here and the Galaxy K zoom comes with support for popular photo sharing networks like Twitter, Fickr and 500px.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are regular homescreens too, with shortcuts, widgets and folders. If you want just those, My Magazine can be disabled completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One widget in particular that caught our attention is called Camera Studio. By default it's a grid of shortcuts to camera features - it can launch the camera straight into Pro suggest mode, open the Pro Suggest market, the Gallery, Dropbox or any other shortcut you add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has a line of toggles, then S Finder and Quick connect buttons and below that is the brightness slider. The slider can be hidden to save space, but you're stuck with the two buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is also home to Recommended apps. It's an extra row of customizable shortcuts that appears when you plug in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Toolbox is a floating icon that shows a list of shortcuts once tapped. This is a quick way to get to some of the most commonly used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom app switcher UI has slight visual tweaks from TouchWiz and two buttons - close all apps and task manager for more advanced controls. Multi window multitasking isn't available even though the screen is big enough and the chipset is fast enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled two power-saving modes as well. The first limits the chipset speed. Optionally it can block background data too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you really need to make those last few percent battery charge last, you go to Ultra power saving mode. This one cuts off all advanced functions and even changes the homescreen to a simple one with big shortcuts (only 6 of them too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This one also works with the Safety assistance feature. In case of an emergency, the phone will alert you to Geo News (e.g. extreme weather, earthquakes) and you get easy access to the primary contacts. There's a button to send you location to your emergency contacts. You can also tap the power key three times to send a message to your emergency contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Easy mode, which shows only a handful of large shortcuts on the screen. The step counter is also visible on the homescreen, so this mode is meant for when you're out on a run and aiming for tiny icons is too hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several Smart features imbue the Galaxy K zoom with a dose of intelligence - Smart stay will keep the display on while you're reading, while Smart pause will stop a video when you look away. There's also smart alarm that vibrates if there are missed notifications when you pick up the device (in case you didn't see the notification LED).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom is powered by an Exynos 5260 Hexa developed in Samsung's own labs. It's based on ARM's big.LITTLE design with two fast Cortex-A15 cores running at 1.7GHz and four lower-power Cortex-A7 cores at 1.3GHz. All six cores can work simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K zoom was allotted 2GB RAM, great for a mid-range device, and the processor is coupled with a relatively fast Mali-T624 GPU. Another plus is that the device is running a fairly recent Android 4.4.2 KitKat, plus the screen is 720p so the GPU doesn't have to work as hard as on 1080p phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're starting off with the cheat-detecting benchmarks. Neither Basemark OS II (testing mostly the CPU) nor Basemark X (testing the GPU) found big discrepancies meaning there's no cheating going on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've included some flagships and a mid-range phone like the Galaxy Grand 2, which uses a Snapdragon 400 chipset (4x Cortex-A7 plus Adreno 305). The two additional Cortex-A15 cores have a big impact and in multithreaded performance the Galaxy K zoom is closer to the LG G3 flagship than it is to the Grand 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the full system test AnTuTu 4 the K zoom practically matched the likes of LG G3 and Sony Xperia Z2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Interestingly, the GFX 2.7 T-Rex test shows quite poor performance from the Mali-T624. However in the newer benchmark, Manhattan, the Galaxy K zoom surprisingly tops the Adreno 330-packing flagships by quite a margin. That's even in the off-screen test where the difference in physical screen resolution doesn't matter.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not sure if this is a problem with the test or if Manhattan is the best case scenario for the Mali-T624. Using Epic Citadel at Ultra quality as a tie-breaker we're going to call the good GFX 3.0 score a fluke. Running at just over 30fps on screen (that's 720p resolution) isn't great performance.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung's highly optimized browser gets along great with the Samsung-made chipset and it posts the best Kraken 1.1 score among the selected phones, including the Galaxy S5. The browser test result is also excellent even when you consider that the 720p screen resolution lightens the load of rendering web pages.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The processor of the Galaxy K zoom proved surprisingly fast getting in competition with Snapdragon 801-powered flagships. With 2GB RAM the phone handles multitasking with easy and browsing the web is as fast as on a Galaxy S5 (save for the resolution difference).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gaming performance proved to be a bit of a weak spot for the Galaxy K zoom and Mali-T624. 3D games will run even at high quality settings but you'll have to sacrifice framerate (for action games running at 60fps rather than 30fps is important). Still, that's a great performance coming from an essentially a mid-range smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dialer with Blocking mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom strong reception and in-call quality was clear and loud (even too loud perhaps at high volumes). The dialer is the familiar TouchWiz app and features all the basics - smart dial, quick dial and even a video call button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is part of a tabbed app that also houses the Logs. Those are very detailed and show not only calls, but messages too and you can filter by various types of events (missed call, received message, etc.). There's even a search feature if you need to look up calls from just one number or contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom features auto call rejection, which can reject all calls, only calls from specific numbers or calls unknown numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blocking mode is even more restrictive - it blocks incoming calls and silences notifications and alarms. Only contacts on the priority list will be able to get a call or a message through. Blocking mode can be set to turn on and off automatically during a certain time period (e.g. at night).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were worried that the water-proofing will have detrimental effects to the loudspeaker. While it is indeed quieter than the Galaxy S4, it's not by much and both phones make it to the Good category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom's extra heft doesn't mean the loudspeaker is stronger. With an Average score it's not the best but you shoul'd hear all notifications. The Galaxy S4 zoom fared better here, as do some of the other famous shooters like the Nokia Lumia 1020. The Sony Xperia Z2 also got an Average mark but it can point to its water-proofing as the cause.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The list of contacts is displayed alphabetically and there's an alphabet scroll and a search field. Your contacts automatically get synced with your Google account and your social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are listed by either first or last name, depending on preference. They can be filtered based on where they come from - SIM, phone, specific online accounts or any combination of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options: edit contact, import/export, join contacts, send or print contact cards, get friends via social services, etc. You can edit contacts and assign custom ring and message tones and even custom vibrations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messages app has a row of shortcuts for priority contacts and below that is the list of all conversation threads. Threads feels like a standard IM app and you can customize font size, the shape of the bubbles and the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages app has some cool features too - you can delay dispatch by 3 seconds (or up to 30), so you can cancel a message before it goes out. You can also schedule messages to be sent automatically (say, congratulations for a birthday).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also features spam protection - messages from specific numbers or containing specific phrases can be blocked. Safe mode will disable the feature that automatically makes links clickable and will scan them for potential threats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom comes with two familiar email applications out of the box - one for your Gmail and a generic app to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic app supports multiple accounts and a combined inbox. The priority senders option displays only messages from important contacts and has a row of contact shortcuts just like the Messages app. You can delete a message by swiping it away (an Undo button appears in its place if you mis-swipe).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom uses one of the simpler Samsung keyboards. It's a four row keyboard with no numbers row. Digits are available through a long press the top row, same goes for alternative symbols. There's an option to adjust the delay before the alternatives show up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swipes can do one of three things - continuous input (think Swype), control the cursor key or serve as an alternative to the long press (handy for those languages that use an extended Latin alphabet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also switch to Voice input and the Clipboard view, but the small, floating keyboard from the Galaxy S5 is gone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Smart gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a smartphone / camera hybrid, the Gallery is one of the most important apps. The Galaxy K zoom gallery supports cloud album integration (Facebook, Dropbox and Picasa) plus DLNA so you can easily view content from outside the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, some of the cool sorting options we saw on the Galaxy S5 are gone. On the K zoom you can only view photos and videos sorted by album or by the time they were taken, There isn't even a Location option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy K zoom does add some tags to images though - you can enable Tag buddy to recognize faces in photos (and link them to your contacts), while Location tags display a map showing where the photo was taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom will change the size of the thumbnails and can also open and close individual photos. Batch operations are supported and that includes not just copy/delete but also image rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single image offers additional options. The Details screen is quite extensive, it features a histogram, the basic photo options from EXIF displayed with easy to read icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also "sign" a photo - we put that in quotes since you can scrawl your signature but you can also add text and image watermarks. You can have multiple "signatures" of any type and you can freely move them around and rotate them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Studio option is quite powerful and can do anything from basic editing and photo collages to creating and trimming videos. It also handles the post-processing of Shot &amp; more photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feature rich, user-friendly music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Samsung Galaxy K zoom is as rich as the Galaxy S5 player. It supports Folder view and DLNA, plus it can build automatic playlists with the Music square based mood (calm/exciting, passionate/joyful). The horizontal axis of Music square can be switched to Age, which makes it easy to automatically create a playlist of classics or contemporary hits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options: timescroll, playback controls, an AllShare shortcut. A coverflow-like list of album art lets you know what the next song will be and is an easy way to skip right to it. The music player will also try to find the lyrics for the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled several audio-enhancement features. The SoundAlive equalizer presets are cleverly organized into a square similar to the Music Square. The presets balance between Treble and Bass, Vocals and Instrumental. You can also just tap the Auto toggle or enable a Tube amp effect, 7.1 channel virtualization, along with Studio, Club and Concert Hall effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced equalizer view gives you a proper seven band equalizer you can tune manually and enable additional effects like 3D, Bass and Clarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of audio features doesn't end there. Smart volume will keep the sound level consistent across tracks, while Adapt sound tests the performance of your headphones and tunes the equalizer based on that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player lacks support for some key decoders<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Samsung Galaxy K zoom has a dedicated app that shows files from the device or from DLNA-compatible devices. Each video thumbnail is animated, giving you a quick glimpse into the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are usually no problem, though the codec support is not great. DivX videos won't play and files with multi-channel audio (AC3, DTS) will not play sound. MKV files encoded with h.264 and AVIs with XviD work fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology from the music player is available here too. You can also send the audio over Bluetooth to wireless speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If subtitles are available in the video folder, the video player will automatically find and load them. You can also manually load subtitles if the video and subtitle file names don't match. Subtitle text is fully customizable (font, size, color, transparency).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During playback you can pinch zoom on a part of the video or use the Pop up play to watch the video in a floating window while using other apps. Chapter preview shows animated thumbnails from various segments of the video, making it easy to jump ahead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom did very well in our audio quality test, putting up a performance that we wouldn't mind seeing from a flagship smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hybrid device had flawless output when connected to an active external amplifier, producing excellent scores all over the field. Its volume levels are higher than on the Galaxy S4 zoom, fixing the only issue its predecessor had on that occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively enough, there's very little degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. Save for the relatively minor hike in stereo crosstalk, the output remains perfect. The volume remained strong, making up for a solid showing overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung offers a heavily modified Android browser as well as Chrome out of the box. The TouchWiz browser has the same basics as Chrome - Incognito tabs, desktop view and even bookmark and open tabs syncing (this goes through your Samsung account rather than Google's).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also packs a number of proprietary additions. An R icon to the left of the URL field enables Reader mode, which strips the page of all distractions, leaving only the relevant text and images. You can adjust text size and go into Night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is saving pages for offline reading. If you do this from Reader mode then that's how the page will be saved, but you can't enable reader mode on a Saved page after the fact.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom comes with Kingsoft Office out of the box. It can edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs and view PDFs too. One of the best things about Kingsoft's app is its great cloud integration - it can open files on Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and even from FTP servers. Shareplay lets you do presentations over the internet (the other participants will need the app too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Polaris Office 5 is available as a free download from Samsung Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android calendar has been replaced by S Planner. It has the standard calendar views but the most useful one combines month view with the agenda view - the days of the month are displayed in the top half of the screen, the events on the currently selected day are below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that Samsung Kies does not sync with the Google Calendar. The Galaxy K zoom itself has no issues handling multiple online calendars though. S Planner can use AccuWeather to display the forecast for the next few days so you can plan accordingly (this only shows up in Month view though, not Month and agenda).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android Device Manager can help recover your device but Samsung has a bespoke solution called Find my mobile. It has remote controls so you can reset and lock the device if you lose it and check its location on a map. Once reset, you can prevent the phone from being reactivated. The phone can send out a (very) short message the moment a new SIM card is inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a backup function that keeps your phone logs, messages, wallpaper and several other settings backed up in the cloud. You can the scheduling to always have a recent backup. If you like, you can link the Samsung Cloud with your Dropbox account for easier access from other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a capable file browser that has Dropbox integration so you can manage cloud-stored files as easily as you do local ones. You can mass move or delete files and folders and even ZIP multiple folders so they are easier to send. You can even connect to FTP servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Essentials pack in the Samsung Apps store provides an app to transfer content from an iPhone, including iCloud content (photos, calendar, memos, call logs, alarms and Wi-Fi settings). You can also sync content from an old Galaxy, including messages, the call log, photos, music, S Notes and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is quite advanced too. Each alarm has its own tone, snooze and repeat settings. It also features Smart alarm, which rings quietly, slowly turning the volume up for a less stressful wakeup. The app also features a world clock, stopwatch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice is one of the earliest digital assistants and is available on the Galaxy K zoom. You activate it by double tapping the home key and you can place calls, dictate messages or memos with it, set alarms, open apps and control phone functionality (e.g. "Turn on Wi-Fi"). S Voice can also answer questions about the weather, read you the news and answer general questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now is available too of course and it can do a lot of the same things, except it displays its answers on the screen instead of speaking them back to you as S Voice does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder is one of the more advanced we've seen. It has multiple modes including Interview and Conversation, plus it can automatically tag files with location. You can enable noise reduction and control audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy K zoom comes with Google Maps and Navigation. It offers voice-guided navigation for cars (including in offline mode thanks to map caching), traffic alerts, pedestrian and bike navigation, public transport too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's great about Maps is the full Google integration - if you searched an address it will show up on your phone and while traveling Google Now will display a card with an estimated time for the drive back home or to work, with warnings of traffic jams. Tap that and Maps is ready with the instructions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store hardly needs an introduction, but it features an extensive catalog of apps that can augment the native camera app. Unfortunately not all such apps can't make use of the zooming features of the Galaxy K zoom. It works in Snapchat via pinch zoom (but it's annoyingly slow) but not in Instagram or Vine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has naturally made its own Apps store available. It features fewer apps than the Play Store, but the good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you pack for vacation you make sure you grab a good pair of travel shoes, but is there such a thing as a good "travel phone"? Perhaps a cheap dual-SIM to make use of a local SIM card, but why not a Samsung Galaxy K zoom - so you can leave your camera at home?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You won't miss it either, the K zoom has the camera guts of a Samsung point-and-shoot. The image quality is much improved since the Galaxy S4 zoom generation and the camera software has been greatly simplified with fun features added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S4 zoom had a full focus on manual controls but the reality is that a 1/2.3" sensor and a fixed lens will never really appeal to photographers with the advanced knowledge to make use of these. The Galaxy K zoom instead is shifting focus on making fun photos easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the image quality you get out of a flagship phone is comparable, the K zoom has the distinct advantage of 10x optical zoom, along with 20x without too much loss in quality. Low light photography at night or in a club is actually possible - the xenon flash produces proper-looking shots instead of the murky photos of an LED-packing smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even better, Samsung improved the Galaxy K zoom to the point where it's actually a good midrange phone. When the Galaxy S4 zoom came out last year it was woefully undeserving of the S4 name. The K zoom carefully omits the premium suffix but it has a good screen, up-to-date software and a fast chipset, along with great connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there are comparable phones you can buy for less, leaving you enough cash to buy a point-and-shoot camera. So the key question is whether you can use the Galaxy K zoom as a daily driver. It's much thicker than any smartphone out there, plus it's fairly heavy even if it feels okay in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has dropped in price and costs less than a half of the Galaxy K zoom. This makes the idea of a "travel phone" more attractive as you won't feel bad about leaving it in the drawer most of the year. The camera isn't as good but it still has 10x optical zoom, a xenon flash and the camera ring makes manual controls a viable option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia did their own math on the phone + camera equation and added more phone than camera. Sure, the Nokia Lumia 1020 has a hump on the back and isn't particularly light, but it's a lot more manageable than the K zoom. It also has a much bigger sensor (it's 135% bigger) and higher resolution to boot. With all those pixels, Nokia manage an impressive lossless zoom (at 5MP) and there's a xenon flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1020 is the outgoing model, the Lumia 930 is the new hotness. It has a smaller sensor with half the resolution but is optically stabilized and there's no hump on the back, the cameraphone is just 9.8mm thick. Plus you get proper flagship specs including a 1080p screen and Snapdragon 800 chipset. There's no xenon flash but price-wise the new Lumia flagship is on par with the Galaxy K zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget that Lumias have excellent offline voice-guided navigation that works without pre-caching maps (which is needed with Google Maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Lumia 1020 ? Nokia Lumia 930</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony have a large-sensored shooter too - the Exmor RS sensor is as big as the K zoom sensor, same resolution too. There's no zooming here though and the image quality falls short of Nokia's 20MP shooters or the Galaxy K zoom (we've had issues with lens defects for example). It does record 2160p video though, which neither the Lumias nor the zooms can offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has an interesting alternative - a detachable camera you can add to any smartphone (Android or IOS) to give it a 1/2.3" sensor and 10x optical zoom. We're talking about the QX10 of course, it lets you add the more advanced camera when you need it and leave the extra bulk at home when you don't. The QX100 has the lauded sensor and optics from the Sony RX100 II for unmatched image quality in the phone world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the QX cameras don't have a built-in flash so you have to rely on the phone's flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony QX10 ? Sony QX100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a finger in every pie on the table so creating a niche device like the Galaxy K zoom is hardly a surprise. The niche it caters to is people who take tons of photos each day, but aren't into the nitty-gritty. The kind that cares about the connectivity and social networking features even the smartest of smart cameras fail to offer. It's a small niche but one the Galaxy K zoom doesn't have to share.</paragraph>
