			<paragraph>RIM are a company with style and simply hopping on the touchscreen bandwagon with another iPhone wannabe just wouldn't suit them. They certainly realized the importance of having a full-touch device in their portfolio but wanted a clear and legible BlackBerry imprint on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm 9500 was a truly intriguing device but never really managed to find its place in the new market it was built for. Too bold and unusual for the BlackBerry-loyals and yet too conservative for the rest of the world, it didn't quite get the results it was hoping for. But the successor might use the publicity the first Storm generated for its own good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is RIM decided to honor the Storm2 with a few upgrades over the original. However, none of them seems to be absolutely crucial so the greatest responsibility falls on the brand new piezo-electric touchscreen. The missing link between touchscreen and a hardware keypad is what many keen texters must have been waiting for. Or at least that's what RIM believe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the SurePress screen didn't work out particularly well on the first Storm and a second failure might herald the demise of the entire series. So the BlackBerry Storm2 knows it needs to impress the audience or it might take a spot in history for all the wrong reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first thing first, let's check out what you get when you buy a shiny new Storm2. Unboxing follows after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the high price tag we find the BlackBerry Storm2 retail package fairly modest. There is no memory card included and the supplied one-piece handsfree looks second-rate. There is a leather carrying case supplied so it's not all bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other items in the box are a charger and microUSB data cable. As you can see in the shots, there's also a user guide and a CD with the software required for synching your handset with a computer and that's all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Storm2 9520 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 112.5 x 62.2 x 14 mm the BlackBerry Storm2 9520 is identically-sized to its predecessor. This is fairly large in general phone terms but about what you'd expect in a handset with a 3.25" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight has been increased by 5 grams to 160 which is quite heavy. The Nokia N97 weighs a good 10 grams less even though it packs a QWERTY keyboard and a larger screen.We do appreciate the solid feel though and are willing to accept the above average weight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 sports some nice design improvements over the original Storm. For one, the four keys at the bottom now blend with the display and are part of the consistent touchscreen experience, not to mention the illusion they create of an even larger display. Also the side keys are now black instead of silver and are much more inline with the general styling of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the design pretty much sticks to the original, the metallic battery cover and the sleek top with invisible buttons still our favorites. Combined with the solid weight, the nice exterior gives the Storm2 the feel to match the price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the front of the BlackBerry Storm2 9520 is taken by the magnificent 3.25" piezo-electric display. Its picture quality is among the best we have seen from RIM and this is quite an achievement given the consistently good BlackBerry screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360 x 480 resolution is hardly remarkable as we can easily think of a number of handsets that come with several times the pixel count but the image quality is splendid. The contrast and brightness are top-notch, easily among the best we have seen on an LCD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is also great, the display easily maintaining readability and colors even in the brightest sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for the really interesting part - the piezo-electric technology that stands behind the touchscreen operation. If you don't have much experience with either of the Storm devices you might be led to believe they use the same clicking screen but that would be wrong. OK, not totally wrong perhaps, as the user experience is similar, but the improved performance of the Storm2 is certainly welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen surface is a regular capacitive touchscreen, which responds to the lightest of touches, bare fingers only though (no gloves or stylus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Storm2 interface uses the tap-to-select and press-to-confirm logic. So, a tap will only highlight an app or a menu item. If you want to activate it, you will need to apply some pressure and push the whole display down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the original Storm the whole display was one regular big-ass button. Now with the piezo-electric enhancement, the screen now is much softer to touch. The piezzo technology is also said to allow multi-touch input, which wasn't possible with the SurePress on the original Storm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're not to expect pinch zoom or anything on the Strom2 but multi touch support is quite relevant to typing - think two-key combos like Shift + whatever. The reduced effort will also make sure your fingers are less tired after longer typing on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because the Storm itself takes part in the display movement, pressing it down isn't possible when the phone is off - the screen won't click unless you power it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new technology of the BlackBerry Storm2 9520 brings both positives and negatives but it's pretty clear where its strength lies. Typing has never been a touchscreen forte but the Storm2 is the closest you will get to a hardware QWERTY keyboard. Quite a lot of users complained about their hands getting tired after writing a few emails on their original Storms but we guess the situation has notably improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the whole clickable screen thing only makes sense perhaps in BlackBerry terms. What makes a BlackBerry handset is messaging after all, and QWERTY and adding touchscreen to the equation shouldn't change things much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But in regular touchscreen terms, the extra step (tap-to-select, press-to-confirm) is more of a disadvantage. In any case, we would strongly advise to try it in person before dropping the cash. And this will involve at least an hour or two of typing and navigating, not just a 5 minute trial.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The four controls on the front panel are operated in the exact same way as the display. Those include the Call and End buttons, as well as the Menu and Back keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the front panel of the Storm2 we find the earpiece and the LED indicator. The status LED notifies of missed calls and messages, low battery and charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the BlackBerry Storm2 9520 hosts the microUSB port and one of the convenience keys. There isn't a cover for the data jack so dust is likely to accumulate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default function of the left convenience key of the Storm2 is voice commands, but you can change that as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, we find the other convenience key, a 3.5mm audio jack and the volume rocker. The 3.5mm audio jack is exposed too. The convenience key is a two-step button, which suggests that it is best suited for its default purpose - operating the autofocus camera. Yet if you aren't much into using your phone camera (which is likely if you are looking at the Storm2 at all) you can assign it a different functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you won't be able to assign two applications to it despite it being capable of handling them on half press/full press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 loudspeaker grill is located on top of the handset, between the two hidden keys. Those take care for switching the Storm2 on/off and muting the handset. The on/off key also locks/unlocks the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Storm2 is very plain with the microphone pinhole providing the only entertainment there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back hosts the 3.15MP autofocus camera and the LED flash. You shouldn't expect miracles from the shooter given its specs and the RIM track record in imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the solid metal (me likey!) battery cover hides the 1400 mAh Li-Ion battery. Given the ample capacity it's little surprise that it can last for almost two full days under fairly heavy usage (about 2 hours a day of fiddling with the phone and 30 minutes of calls).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also here. It is fully hot-swappable and has no trouble handling the largest memory cards currently available on the market (16GB). The only problem is you will have to open the cover each time you access it but we consider it a fair sacrifice for having one less aperture on the surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, as you might have sensed we are delighted with the build quality of the BlackBerry Storm2 9520. There is no wobbling display, or gaps between panels or anything else to raise questions. The handset just radiates sturdiness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for the software part of the review - the user interface is due on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 5 goes touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 runs the new, fifth, version of the company's proprietary OS. It brings a couple of nice new extras to the touchscreen-operated Storm, unlike most other BlackBerry devices which benefited very little from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have been keeping track you would know that we aren't in love with the BlackBerry OS looks but, in all fairness, the touch implementation is a bit better. The little 3D touch to the icons and the few nice transitions look better than what the 9700 Bold has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry OS 5 also introduces kinetic scrolling which greatly facilitates handing of longer lists. The automatic rotation is also supposed to be faster now. Those upgrades have also made their way to the original Storm via a firmware update so they aren't Storm2-exclusive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, very little has been done about the tons of plain ugly text-only submenus that can still be found in the BlackBerry Storm2. Even with the slickest theme applied you are still just a couple of clicks away from these eyesores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with the Storm2 we aren't talking hardcore business users only - the target audience has now widened and might include some people that, you know, might have an eye for the aesthetics. Touchscreen handsets need to provide nice user experience or else their existence is pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming with a generally new touchscreen platform took quite a lot of R&amp;D effort, but they should have saved some for the UI polishing. We really hate it when nice ideas fail only because of negligence. But we digress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is pretty well organized with 8 (by default) shortcut buttons placed at the bottom and all status icons at the top. The profiles can also be accessed straight from here, as well as two other features that you choose to assign to the convenience keys. Tilting the handset to the side doesn't bring a landscape mode of the homescreen but opens the main menu instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 has a menu structure completely different from any other touchscreen handset on the market (save for the original Storm of course). Unlike the iPhone's what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach, you have a menu button here, which revels a list of context-sensitive options. You might want to spend some time learning what is available where if you are a newcomer to the BlackBerry world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pleased with the Storm2 performance. Lagging was very rare and the handset seemed pretty stable for the time of our review. There was only one restart in about a week's time and that's not bad at all. RIM doesn't provide any information about the CPU inside the Storm2 but either it is faster than the original Storm or the new version of the OS is better optimized to make the device feel snappier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: this is Spartaaaaaa<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sorry, we just couldn't help it - the Storm2 Spartan phonebook graphics really brought it out in us. The unlimited capacity and the decent functionality is of course what matters more but, again, the overall experience counts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search line color has been changed from black to white in the new 5.0 version but that hardly makes much difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company in one of those black and white lists that we warned you about. You can search contacts by gradually typing a name like on almost any other phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available this time and you can create as many groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact gives you a vast number of fields which are organized in several sub-groups. You can also replicate some of the fields (those that you are going to need anyway) as many times as you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony fares much better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Getting some eyesores from the phonebook we went over to inspecting the Storm telephony and we were in for a nice treat this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really dig the Smart dial feature, which works when inserting contacts in messaging too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 in-call screen offers four large and easy to press buttons plus five shortcuts to features you are most likely to need during a call. Those include notes, calendar, contacts, dial pad and home screen. Well that last one might not be what you need during a call but it's the quickest way to an application that is not on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers good in-call voice quality and we didn't experience any drops or coverage issues at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the BlackBerry Storm2 9520. We weren't overwhelmed but the Storm2 still snatched a good score, meaning missed calls are only likely in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BIS messaging only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. It also has the BlackBerry instant messenger preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storm2 has a fairly simple and easy to use organization of messaging and all messages are composed through a common editor. The good news is that version 5 of the OS also introduces threaded messaging to help you organize your inbox even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's about time we discussed the text input methods available on the Storm2 in more detail. The handset offers a choice of three different keyboards and we did find them all quite pleasing. Those are the same as on the previous Storm, except that now that less effort is required to push the screen your fingers are less tired of long typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start though with the regular multitap keypad. Its predictive writing works much better with the touchscreen because you can easily select the word you're looking for from the suggested options. That aside, it works as good as any other multitap keypad, only the keys are even larger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old BlackBerry SureType keypad is already making its way on several other platforms and that's for a very good reason. It's easy to use and if you master the AutoText (that's the BlackBerry T9) you might as well match the QWERTY typing speeds at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice thing is users are free to choose whether the SureType or the multitap keypad should appear by default in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a portrait QWERTY keyboard but we don't think it will be a very popular option. Its keys aren't big enough for large handed users and if you really insist on the QWERTY layout you would do way better tilting the handset to the side and getting the real keyboard experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, we said it: the real keyboard experience. The landscape QWERTY takes slightly more than half the screen height and comes in a four-row layout. Keys are large enough and with the display sinking on every press you can really speed your way through tons of text. The feedback provided is both visual (blue halo when a key is touched) and physical and with the two combined you get excellent results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, this is a virtual QWERTY keyboard but it gets as close to a regular press as we have seen. What's more, it's less tiring on the fingers as the phone itself helps you push the screen - the piezo-electric technology works like power steering in cars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far so good with the BlackBerry messaging department - the handset behaves beautifully when it comes to text input. Now the catch: out of the box you can only set up BlackBerry Internet Service email accounts on the Storm. This means that without a proper Blackberry service plan the handset is just a plain email-less device and globally there are quite a lot of carriers that do not support BIS yet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 music won't get too many wows for its looks but it does a fairly decent job. If you are mostly about listening to music and not really into fiddling with different player options then you might feel just fine with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player sorts the music library automatically by artist, album and genre and you can search your tracks by gradual typing. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is also supported and there is a single track repeat option. Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Strangely enough, there's no indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 has virtually identical audio quality to its predecessor and that is as high as we have seen the BlackBerries go. The handset performs well in every aspect of our test and goes pretty close to the best on the market. It didn't break any records but the great overall performance is more important here and the Storm2 managed to deliver it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone boasts a really good frequency response keeping on perfect track for most of its range. The rest of the readings are also excellent with great noise level and dynamic range and distortions kept well within standards. The stereo crosstalk reading is quit good. All in all, you will be enjoying some fine sound with BlackBerry Storm 9520.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A great video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Watching videos was one of our favorite activities on the BlackBerry Storm2 9520. The great picture quality, the ample screen and the good number of supported codecs make the handset a decent portable player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player usually works fullscreen with the virtual buttons only appearing upon a tap on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about the Storm2 video player is that it comes with DivX and XviD support. We had no trouble playing most of our test videos on the handset, which is better than most of its RIM stablemates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in most cases you will only need to upload the video to your Storm2 and start the player - no converting necessary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Passable image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery of the Storm2 is nothing spectacular, being hardly any different than the one we saw on its predecessor a year ago. It does pretty well overall with the 100% zoom shortcut earning our appreciation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery has standard functionality including thumbnail and list view of the images. It also offers finger gestures, meaning you can browse pictures by sweeping your finger across the screen. You can also zoom in on a photo by pressing the screen and sweeping with your finger. Opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer. All you need to do to switch modes is to flip the phone sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are particularly happy with the zoom to actual size shortcut on the BlackBerry devices. This gives you a quick and easy way to review photos in the finest detail possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is decently fast but the zooming is on the slow side. There is some lagging even when it is handling 3 megapixel photos, let alone if you upload higher-res images.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An average 3 megapixel shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm2 9520 is equipped with a 3 megapixel autofocus camera and a LED flash. We are used to expecting next to nothing from the BlackBerry cameras so when one actually produces average photos we are nicely surprised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is still on the worse side of devices we have tested. Since the display has the same aspect ratio as the camera sensor, the readings that appear at the bottom cover a part of the viewfinder and impede proper framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera options are also pretty uncomfortable to access as there are no shortcuts on the screen meaning that you have to dig in the menu. Not that there are too many settings you can apply, but still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part (or rather the only good part) of the camera is undoubtedly the image-geotagging, which allows you to automatically record your location in the images EXIF data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The few other settings available are: white balance, color effects and digital image stabilization. There is also the obligatory picture size and quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Storm2 9520 is about average in the 3 megapixel league. It's about the same as on the Bold 9700 and close to what the other manufacturers offered a few years ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not enjoying particularly good weather around the office these days so the camera samples might seem even worse, but actually the amount of resolved detail is acceptable. The noise levels are acceptable for a 3 megapixel shooter in those kinds of conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is OK, though hardly impressive, and the colors could have used a tad more saturation but they aren't too bad overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If there is one thing that is generally worse than a BlackBerry still camera that would be the BlackBerry camcorder. Yet the Storm2 isn't completely hopeless offering videos with a maximum resolution of 480 x 352 pixels and framerate of a good 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is still way too much compression applied and the colors seem a bit too dull but let's not get too picky. In the BlackBerry world any video where you can tell a person from a bus is considered good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in 3GP format and if you fancy, you can apply various color effects. The LED flash can also be set to work as a video light.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: This time they got everything right<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Storm had a prominent omission on its connectivity list but the Storm2 has it all covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the 3G with 7.2 Mbps HSDPA gives you the extra speed. Wi-Fi is also at hand with a nice and easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth with A2DP support rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9700 is also equipped with a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. You can even use the handset as a tethered modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you have the option to use your microSD memory card slot for file transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Clickable touchscreen boosts the web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of BlackBerry Storm2 is good enough with the extraordinary touchscreen certainly earning some extra points in favor. You will never again hit a link by mistake with this one when scrolling as these are two very different actions. Now, if only they'd added Flash support all would've been just great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panning is done by sweep gestures, and zoom is controlled by tapping on the screen. You can also zoom using the shortcut keys appearing on the screen in non-fullscreen mode or via the relevant menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you zoom in by tapping on a desired column the text does automatically center onscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is quite good, making all the pages look as if browsed on a desktop computer. The resolution allows a good amount of content to fit on the screen but it is no match for the WVGA screens, which are getting more and more popular recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the web browser has no Flash support, meaning Flash video websites like YouTube are a no-go for the Storm owners. Text reflow is also absent but that is not as much of an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the Storm web browser is quite comfortable to work with, even though a few more gestures implemented might have improved it even more. It's not quite as good as, say, the Android browser software-wise but the hardware seems better suited for the task.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time-management skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer is one of the best parts of the Storm2, just as on most other BlackBerry devices. It has a good set of applications and although some of them are not quite the lookers we would have liked, their usability is on a very decent level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customized events to be set up. A few event presets would have been nice too but it's not really a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well stocked, with preinstalled applications able to open and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. Furthermore, document editing is also supported unlike most competing phones. Unfortunately, there is no PDF viewer preinstalled so potential users will have to get one themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter as well as voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application will only allow you to set one alarm which doesn't get standing ovation. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the tone, snooze interval and the volume as well as the vibration intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen. The display then automatically lights up when you lift the phone thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>There're a couple of games too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm 9520 only came with two preinstalled games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first was a version of the all too popular Bricks game, adapted for touch control. While you might need some time getting used to operating your pad this way, once you do so it is hardly too different from the other similar titles we have tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other game is the Word Mole, where you have to compose words with the letters given on the board. Various bonuses and bonus levels are also at hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Storm2 9520 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps, which supposedly come preinstalled (not on our unit though). Users stateside also enjoy the Verizon Navigator, which is quite more functional and you can also get the free Google Maps if data traffic doesn't bother you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps provides basic map functionality plus voice-guided navigation. You can enter addresses straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Maps also lets you send your location to anyone via email or SMS. This is yet another application however that simply doesn't work without a BIS account.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>RIM have certainly succeeded in making their touchscreen absolutely consistent with the very BlackBerry concept. The Storm series are not shying away from innovation, but the number one purpose of innovation here is to respect tradition. There's nothing wrong with that but it's not the best way to appeal to a wider market. Anyway, the ongoing effort to match the hardware keyboard ergonomics on a touchscreen seems almost complete with the Storm2. Typing is what books the Storm2 a premier league place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However yet again RIM seem to have underestimated the visuals and that might be decisive when the line is drawn. The outdated graphics have somewhat improved, with a bit of touchscreen makeup, but are no match for the elaborate and glamorous interfaces of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storm2 is in its prime at texting, but in all other contexts the device fails to impress. And even if you're willing to live with that, there comes the sky-high price tag to change your mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong - the idea of having a side-slider QWERTY functionality in a much more compact package is really appealing but not enough perhaps to justify that kind of asking price. After all, the competitors can give you an only slightly thicker QWERTY slider with a better screen and vastly superior multimedia for less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Nokia N97 and Nokia N97 mini are credible alternatives for the Storm2 as they offer good enough typing and come easier on the wallet. The BlackBerry email and security are a class in their own but hardly always essential.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 3GS is perhaps both RIM's inspiration and frustration. Many observers were keen to interpret the Storm (and quite naturally the Storm2) as a direct response to the Apple phone. Yet we don't quite see how these will compare at all. One is all about near physical typing while the other is still choking with the haptics idea. But at the end of the day, if touchscreen is your only request, the general iPhone experience is way ahead of BlackBerry.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If the BlackBerry service limitations aren't much to your taste but you do insist on a touchscreen smartphone you have a great choice of powerful devices. Among the fairly recent releases, you might want to check out the Google Nexus One or plenty of WinMo handsets. Samsung Omnia II and OmniaPRO, HTC Touch Diamond2 and Touch Pro2 are all perfectly capable smartphones that will give you great all-round functionality without forcing you to spend extra on email.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Once again we have to underline that it's not a regular mobile phone we are talking about here. With BlackBerries, the service is an intrinsic part of the package and that makes it harder to make up your mind. You have to like them both or you better look elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The straightforward assumption would be that the Storm2 is the dream device for those who have a solid BlackBerry background and want to explore touchscreen. Now, that's a pretty limited pool to draw on, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a broader perspective, the Storm2 is a capable touchscreen smartphone. And the touchscreen interpretation of the BlackBerry OS is better than the early Symbian attempts. But in pure market terms, Symbian can get away with a lot more things than BlackBerry.</paragraph>
