			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab family was introduced back in 2011, to at least get a foot in the door swung open by the rising Apple iPad. The Tabs came in a variety of sizes and connectivity options with displays ranging from 7 inches all the way to the massive 10.1 inches, and more combos of screen resolution and processor specs than you can shake a stick at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just by comparing Samsung's and Apple's lineup, you can see two very different strategies at play - while Apple relies on the exclusivity of their devices and content to garner interest in their products, Samsung instead hopes to cater to every possible market segment under the sun - and has been immensely successful in the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is exactly tablets though, where Samsung have been struggling to match the kind of impact they've had in phones. The latest Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is in a way affected by the shifts in Samsung's tablet strategy. In an ideal world, the Galaxy 3 10.1 would've been the Koreans' flagship slate. But that position is already filled by the Note 10.1, with a successor possibly in the pipeline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Galaxy Tab hasn't got top of the line specs and comes across as a routine upgrade, whose single clear-cut advantage is the latest software version available. The latest Android build, 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, comes with arguably the most feature-rich custom UI from Samsung - TouchWiz 5.0. But how does it stack up to the likes of the iPad 4, or a handful of emerging Android tablets? Let's take a look at the key features at a glance:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the rather modest spec, including a dual-core processor, compared to some quad-core-powered full-HD-screen-flaunting droid tablets, it's more fitting to look at the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 not as a high end device, but as a midranger with a large screen, aimed at a more price-conscious crowd. This goes in hand with a prominent trend of big screens in the midrange, like the Samsung Galaxy Grand and the Samsung Galaxy Mega.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's clear that while the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 gives you a large 10.1-inch display, it's not the pinnacle of Samsung's tablet lineup - that honor still belongs to the S-pen capable Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. Nevertheless, the Tab 3 10.1 offers a compelling connectivity package, and could prove to be an enticing offer in its price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get this review rolling on the next page with our usual hardware tour. Next up, we'll be curious to see that new generation dual-core Intel Atom in action, which is a first on a tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design takes after what is typical of today's Samsung mobile devices. Although the nature UX has gone through some changes since its debut on the Galaxy S III, the overall look in terms of hardware has remained the same. Here, you can see the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 alongside (from bottom left) the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0, Galaxy S4, and Galaxy Tab 3 8.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hyperglaze finish is largely the same since its inception, although it features a checkerboard texture that adds a bit of style. Unfortunately, it's not as noticeable on the white paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you'll find the 3MP front-facing shooter alongside the ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As in other recent devices, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 allows users to control the display brightness without disabling automatic mode. Once you define an offset, your Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 screen will always be slightly brighter or dimmer than the automatically selected level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the classic arrangement of physical hardware Home key, flanked by the capacitive Menu and Back keys. This layout has been in use since the early days of the Galaxy line and Samsung has stayed with its decision not to put the Android keys on-screen (as Google dictates), even on a screen this big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This, by the way, makes Samsung tablets among the few Android-powered tablets with a hardware Home key, which puts it in the same bracket with no other than the Apple iPad. To be honest, we don't think this works particularly well on ten-inchers. Sure, this size is mostly meant for landscape use, and the layout of controls acknowledges that, but unwanted key presses are likely in portrait hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Tab 3 10.1 are about as uneventful as it gets, with only a 3.5mm audio jack on the left and a speaker port on each side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This speaker placement is far more logical than Galaxy tablets with speakers along the bottom, where you're more prone to muffle the sound. Still, it's not as good though as the front-facing speakers of the previous generation and the 10" Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 gets to see most of the action in terms of controls. You have a power/lock button on the far left, followed by a volume rocker, microSD card slot, IR-port, and microSIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is also fairly uninhabited, save for the microUSB port used for charging and connectivity (USB Host is also supported), and a microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's little of note at the back of the tablet. The 3MP camera lens is centrally placed at the top, slightly protruding so the Tab 3 10.1 rests on it when placed on a level surface, but its hardened glass is not too easy to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, holding the device in one hand across the back is possible - but the hyperglaze finish doesn't provide much grip. Otherwise, the ample screen bezel means it can be comfortably used with two hands in landscape mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display is nothing special<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Tab 3 10.1 has a standard LCD - Samsung has given up AMOLED in tablets for the time being, with the Galaxy Tab 7.7 remaining its only attempt so far. AMOLED screens are now reserved for the Note phablets, while tablets have to make do with regular LCDs. Nevertheless, the one in the Tab 3 10.1 gets the job done with a 1280 x 800 pixel resolution, which results in 149ppi and a 16:10 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the blacks aren't as dark as some other comparable devices, the whites are adequately bright, and the resulting contrast ratio is good for its class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the display quality is perfectly fine for this price range, we wished we could see a higher-resolution panel on this one. The display is clearly not one of the tablet's main selling points - it's the same resolution and display technology found on the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 - however, the compromises made are easy to live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a closer look at the display matrix:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 screen up close</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 by Samsung runs a TouchWiz-skinned Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean build, the same combo you'll see on the smaller Tab 3 variants, as well as members of the Note family (although those have added S-Pen stylus support).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this video we've shot of the user interface in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tab lineup can be considered the lesser of the two Samsung tablet hierarchies, due to their lack of S-Pen support. Because there's no stylus, many of the nifty features that set Samsung devices apart, like Air View and gesture support, are not present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being said, TouchWiz-enhanced Jelly Bean is still one of the more feature-rich Android builds available, with an ample helping of extras that many manufacturers can't match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the lockscreen comes configured with a standard background with a clock occupying the left half of the screen, and the right half being where you can swipe to unlock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Why Samsung chose to have most of the nifty lockscreen features disabled by default is a mystery, but it's likely to do with conserving the Tab 3 10.1's seemingly insufficient RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are alternative unlock routines as well - Face unlock, Face and voice unlock, as well as pattern, PIN or password prompts you can choose from. There are voice-based wakeup commands that can just start S Voice or launch a preselected app, and you can also enable a second clock on the lockscreen that shows up when you're roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you make it past the lockscreen, you'll be greeted by a familiar homescreen. The eight shortcuts that appear along the bottom are visible in both landscape and portrait orientation, all of which are customizable save for the rightmost one, which must always remain the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the notification area there are nine (six in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than nine toggles in total, and you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the upper rightmost button that reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, a total of 13 on the Tab 3 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange this grid, but the top row toggles are always visible. Accessing the notification are with a two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles. Another nice trick is to long press on a toggle to go to the related settings (e.g. Wi-Fi settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down we get the Brightness slider with an Auto checkbox. It allows you to adjust the brightness even in auto mode - the backlight strength is still adjusted according to ambient lighting conditions, but you can tweak it to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, at the very bottom of the screen you get a line for connected WiFi network, which turns into "No internet connection" when there isn't a network available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - any of the available homescreen panes can be set as default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen, giving you an overview of all panes as thumbnails. This is especially useful if you want to quickly locate a widget based on its appearance. You can also choose to have your app drawer ordering to custom, alphabetical grid or alphabetical list. There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can check how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can hold down the home button to access the app switcher, which allows you to to go back and forth between apps. You'll see a vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app - tapping on an app opens it, while swiping it away vertically removes it from the list. There are also shortcuts to a task manager, Google Now, and a Kill all apps button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu uses a split-screen interface which displays a menu of settings on the left part of the screen, and the relevant toggles and options on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the more advanced features that made it into Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is Smart Stay - it uses the front-facing camera to detect the user looking at the screen, so that it never dims or locks while you're reading. This makes reading web pages and e-books comfortable, even if you've set the screen timeout low to preserve the battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and Google's own Voice Actions - it can be used to initiate or answer a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set or snooze an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, take a photo, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, has the weather forecast for your location and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest Android update, Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is powered by a dual-core Intel Atom Z2560 clocked at 1.6GHz, 1GB of RAM and a PowerVR SXG544MP2 GPU. We haven't seen an Atom processor running on an Android-powered Samsung tablet yet, so we were quite eager to see how it performs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmark Pi tests raw CPU performance regardless of cores, and it's obvious that Intel's architecture just isn't able to stand up to the likes of Exynos and Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs, as it comes out last in this test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Linpack, the Tab 3 10.1 isn't quite able to jump over the hump into flagship territory, like the higher-spec'd Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but it does outperform the Google Nexus 10. Geekbench 2, however, shows it's significantly behind the pack.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu and Quadrant measure overall system performance by throwing in GPU, RAM, storage and more into the mix. Results here were markedly better than those, which tested only the CPU, especially in AnTuTu, where the Tab 3 10.1 was only beaten by the Samsung Galaxy S4 flagship smartphone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>GLBenchmark 2.5 puts the graphics processor to the test, and the device again falls towards the lower end of the charts when offscreen fps are measured. Epic Citadel, on the other hand, measures the performance of the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 at its native resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, and posts some good numbers, beating out the former Galaxy S III flagship.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When it comes to internet browsing performance, our web browser benchmarks offer mixed results. SunSpider shows decent but not spectacular JavaScript performance, while Browsermark 2, which is dedicated to performing HTML 5 tests, has the Tab 3 10.1 towards the top of the list. Vellamo, which is a combination of both, places the device towards the middle of its chart.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has all you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On 3G-enabled versions of the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, you'll find a phonebook that packs an incredibly wide range of features. You'll find the same features from Galaxy smartphones here as well, including four tabs on top, which provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the settings menu, the phonebook is divided into left and right sections, with your contacts on the left, and their relevant details on the right. Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phonebook finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, there are a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have a variety of fields listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Conversely, pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 (model number P5200) that we are testing has 3G connectivity and telephony to go with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers top notch in-call audio and managed to hold onto a signal trouble-free. Earpiece volume is great and Samsung has even gone as far as adding an in-call equalizer, which does wonders. Obviously, the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is not the most comfortable piece of hardware to use while calling - especially if you want privacy - so if you have to use its telephony, you're better off doing it via a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app on the Tab 3 10.1 features Smart Dial, which searches names and numbers simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by the newly added S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter"). It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available options during a call include taking a using the keypad, muting, boosting the volume, or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with room for customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is fairly straightforward, you get a list of conversation threads, with the recipient(s) being indexed on the left, and the actual threads being displayed on the right. There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 displays an additional row above the letters for numbers - like a full-fledged computer keyboard does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Swipe-like mode which tracks your finger and guesses the word you're trying to type. This feature works great but has limited language support for now. Another swiping function lets you move the text caret by swiping left or right on the keyboard. Only one of these two features can be enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also handwriting recognition, as well as a split keyboard that allows you to type with just your thumbs on opposite ends of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a screen this big, the floating keyboard is a nice option. It takes up less space on the screen and can be moved around, plus the smaller keyboard may be easier to type on for some ("smaller" here is relative, it's still quite big compared to phone keyboards).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically converts it into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use S Voice to dictate your message or use Google's built-in voice recognition software if you don't feel like typing. Since this is a Jelly Bean device, you can also use voice typing without a data network connection, as long as you have downloaded the necessary language packs. Samsung also provides the option to change the default input method.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has left a lot of room for customizing your messaging experience. You can choose from different bubble styles and colors, and even change the background image to whatever you want. Also, the volume controls let you increase or decrease the font in conversations to really make use of the large screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the dialer, the Messaging app has built-in spam prevention. You can block some numbers (or all unknown numbers) and even add specific phrases to be blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app now features color coded sender images, based on the first letter of the sender's name. This lets you easily see who your most popular email correspondences are with. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe an open message left or right to go to the previous / next. Swiping on a specific line in the inbox will archive the message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Email app can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality, the Email app is very similar to the Gmail one, with the key difference being the addition of support for multiple third-party accounts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery loaded with features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. Just like in the phonebook, you can choose what kind of content should be displayed - photos and videos from the phone, Dropbox, Facebook or Picasa. You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that album's stack of photos but a swipe to the right will list all albums. In this mode you can browse images in a dual-screen mode and easily select files from multiple folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on a picture, the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large display is great for viewing photos - the screen is as big as most photo frames and the lower resolution doesn't really show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, alongside an Allshare cast button for sharing the image over DLNA. Below the image is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album, which you can tap to move to other images or simply swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To enable photo editing in the Gallery you'll have to install the (free) Photo Editor app from the Samsung App store, a 36MB download. Once installed, you can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed really - it's an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player has folder support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC, Wave, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 can also search for content on third party DLNA servers like PCs or other phones on the same network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a scrollable timeline, play/pause and skip controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, an AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area, and the lockscreen as well if you have the relevant lockscreen widget added.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great video player with excellent codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player found on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 has four tabs across the top. The default one, Thumbnails, provides a thumbnail view of all the videos on your device, including the ones on an attached microSD card. Unlike on some other Galaxy smart devices, the thumbnails are not animated, likely due to the low onboard RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The List view is similar to Thumbnails, except that it allows you to view more items on the screen, while Folders view allows you to easily browse your videos sorted in folders. Finally, nearby devices lets you stream videos to the Tab 3 10.1 via DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large screen, and some of the same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video. On devices that support Multi-View, this feature becomes rather redundant, but it's a welcome addition here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file, and there's even support for foreign languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video codec support, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 passed with flying colors. It played everything we threw at it, including Xvid, DivX, WMV, MP4, MKV, 1080p videos, including ones with AC3 sound tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is the second member of the Tab 3 family that we put through our audio quality testing routine and we are pleased to say that it did every bit as impressively as the Tab 3 8.0. When connected to an active external amplifier it delivers perfectly clean output with no interferences whatsoever. It's not a particularly loud device, but it's not too quiet either, so you will have more than enough oomph with just about any headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged in a pair of headphones there was very little degradation to be witnessed. The stereo crosstalk goes up, but still remains very solid and the rest of the readings are barely affected. A very solid performance indeed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3MP camera is nothing to write home about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1s main camera can capture stills of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels and 720p videos, while the one on the front takes 1.3MP pictures and VGA video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated user interface we first saw on the Galaxy Camera. A virtual shutter key and a capture video button are always available in the viewfinder, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting 16:9 720p videos, you'll still have to frame your videos using a 4:3 aspect ratio viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mode button brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops the descriptions but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app offers a fair amount of features including geotagging, Panorama, Beauty face, Sound &amp; Shot, low-light mode, Sports, and more, but some of the premium shooting modes found on other devices are missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the 3MP camera is not as good as on phones and phablets, but it's less likely after all that you'll be lugging around the 10-inch device out and about to shoot a lot of photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise levels are kept down for the most part, and the level of detail is fairly high despite the low resolution, but the colors look bland and the dynamic range is poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out these camera samples:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 stores videos in MP4 files with a bitrate of around 12Mbps, although we've seen this drop down to almost 10Mbps in action-packed scenes. Stereo audio is recorded at 128Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is not available, instead you'll have to settle with continuous autofocus, which tends to trigger just a bit too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 tends to have accurate if somewhat muted colors, and the dynamic range leaves something to be desired. Noise levels and white balance are similar to those in still images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard connectivity features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung P5200 Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 has basic connectivity features, including quad-band 2G and 3G support. There are WiFi only (P5210) and LTE-enabled (P5220) variants as well, so you'll have to check to see which model number you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility and Wi-Fi Direct. The tablet also has Bluetooth 4.0 support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port also acts as a USB Host, which means that besides charging and connectivity, you'll be able to connect various USB accessories to your Tab 3 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare DLNA functionality, which used to be a standalone application, is now more tightly integrated into the respective Samsung applications. To share or access content on nearby DLNA-enabled devices, you do this directly from the Video Player app, the Gallery, and the Music Player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cooler way to share is with Group Play, recently introduced with the Galaxy S4 flagship. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA, it's interactive. You can share images, documents, music, and even play games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While this version of Group Play does not require NFC for connectivity - devices communicate over Wi-Fi, with your Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 as the hotspot that others connect to - the other devices will still need to support Group Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Peel Smart Remote is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. The app starts out by asking your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area, so it can double as a TV Guide.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Awesome web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1s large screen means that web browsing is a great experience on the device. The pixel density of the screen isn't very high, but that only matters if you like reading text at low zoom levels (it gets fuzzy).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, incognito tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. You won't have to worry about mobile versions of sites either, as the display is large enough to accommodate desktop versions of most sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness and colors option gives you four different presets to adjust the display according to your preferences. Automatic brightness is an option, too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Chrome browser also comes preloaded on the Tab 3 10.1, and gives you access to many additional features, including Labs support for experimental options from Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash cannot be enabled in either browser, as support for plug-ins has been dropped by Adobe.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 comes with a full-fledged document editor on board, which allows you to edit Word files, pdf's, spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, as well as connect to various cloud services such as Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner replaces the old Calendar app that usually comes with Samsung smart devices, and is just as useful even without the S-pen. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, month, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner can sync with multiple calendar and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app allows you to create notes which can then be quickly shared via sms or email, or even automatically synced to your Google Drive account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly, instead of the usual clock app, the Tab 3 10.1 features a few applications which perform some - but not all - of the same functions. Alarm lets you create alarms which can be set to go off not only at various times, but during certain days of the week as well. The World Clock pops up the various cities on a globe, letting you select them for a quick overview the local time zone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, and offers advanced math functions as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preloaded Paper Artist app imports a photo and runs a filter over it (there are plenty to choose from). Then you can go in and color certain areas for added effect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps Navigation gives you the most out of GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung P5200 Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in couple of minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We have to say, we didn't experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play now backed up by the Samsung Apps store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is laid across several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Accessing the Play Store with our Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 revealed a couple of sections with apps specifically tailored for use with large screen devices, which we found very helpful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide whether the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps. From music / video players, to file managers and various tools, you'll always see something worth a try. Keep in mind, though, that there will be some apps that are incompatible with the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 due to its x86 CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has added its own app store to the mix. It features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far smaller number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like many of Samsung's midrange offerings, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is a mixed bag of features. On the one hand, you get the large display and slim design, the great codec support, and rich connectivity features which include an IR-port, while on the other you get a dual-core Intel Atom processor with questionable performance, a 1280 x 800 TFT panel which is hardly the sharpest tool in the shed, and a free ticket to a losing battle you'll be waging with the sub-1GB of user-available RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, low memory availability seems to be the Achilles' heel of the Tab 3 10.1, as even on a fresh boot you'll find that right around 700 MB of your available 0.9 GB are already taken up. We found ourselves using the 'Clear memory' function of the task manager way more often than we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung obviously realized this deficiency and tried their best to cover it up by stripping the Tab 3 10.1s Jelly Bean build of several memory-intensive features. Of the new gesture and sensor-related features recently introduced with the Galaxy S4 flagship only Smart Stay has made it into the Tab 3 10.1, and Multi Window, which allows you to work split-screen with two apps at once, is also missing. Animated thumbnails of your videos in the gallery have been replaced with static ones, and the rotating lockscreen backgrounds from TripAdvisor are disabled by default, no doubt to save on memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, one other advantage we forgot to list its price. The Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is expected to retail at around &#x20ac;300, which is lower than both of the previous generations of the tablet when they first launched. It's also considerably lower than a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, which can currently be had for just over &#x20ac;400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, however, previous Galaxy Tab iterations have fallen in price considerably, and as the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 features largely the same specs sheet, it comes in as one of our recommendations. The same RAM, memory, screen and camera are all found on the Tab 2 10.1, and with the exception of the processor (dual-core 1GHz) and marginally larger dimensions, you're getting a very similar device, for about &#x20ac;50 less. Even the Android version - currently upgradeable to 4.1.0 Jelly Bean, may see the 4.2.2 update found on the Tab 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 P5100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, if you must have it all, then the pinnacle of Samsung's tablet technology is undoubtedly the Note 10.1. With 2 GB of RAM, you should get the most out of the quad-core 1.4 GHz Exynos CPU. While it doesn't (yet) have the latest 4.2.2 Jelly Bean build, the Note 10.1 does have the S-Pen and all the great functionality that comes with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 N8000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Samsung's not your cup of tea, then the Acer Iconia Tab A700 is a capable alternative. At 259 x 175 x 11 mm and 665 g you get a heavier device with larger bezels on its 10.1-inch display, but the A700 more than makes up for that with a much sharper 1920 x 1200 pixels resolution, 5MP camera, and a quad-core 1.3 GHz Tegra 3 chipset. The battery is also much more robust at 9800 mAh, but you'll have to make do with Acer's variant of Android 4.0 ICS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Iconia Tab A700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Android is not on your list of must-haves, then Samsung's own Windows RT-powered Ativ Tab P8510 will match the Tab 3 10.1 across the board, with the notable exception of telephony support. Its ample storage space and dual-core 1.5 GHz Krait CPU will give you better performance, and Windows RT may be more appropriate for users accustomed to a desktop environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Ativ Tab P8510</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Huawei offer a very competitive alternative with their MediaPad 10 FHD, starting with an impressive 1920 x 1200 pixel 10-inch display, alongside 2GB of RAM, a quad-core 1.2 GHz processor, and an 8MP shooter with 1080p video recording. Although you won't be getting as full of an Android package with Huawei's ICS build compared to Samsung's 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with TouchWiz, the MediaPad 10 FHD has it beat in both price and hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei MediaPad 10 FHD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you can put its memory woes aside, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is a decent all-around offering, especially at its proposed priced point. The Infrared port is a nice touch, but we would have liked to see NFC connectivity thrown in as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The midrange tablet market has few offerings at this screen size, and most of the alternatives that can compete with Samsung's price are older-generation devices. Of course, the likes of the Xperia Tablet Z and the Google Nexus 10 are way out of the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1's league. It seems Samsung are exploring a niche at a safe distance from the competition's flagships.</paragraph>
