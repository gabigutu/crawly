			<paragraph>Samsung i320 is worth admiration. In its tiny (11.5 mm thin) but extremely elegant body the manufacturer has fit a full-function QWERTY keypad, a rather good display, and most importantly - Windows Mobile OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 tunes with the latest trend in the mobile world, that is, the thinner the better. Motorola was the first to challenge users, but lately the slimmest mobile phones are being manufactured by Samsung, with the X820 model being merely 7 mm thick. What's more, after common phones have been put on a diet, it is now the smartphones' turn. The first to hit the market is Samsung i320 - a device on the border between a smartphone and a communicator with a thickness of only 12 mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 features a Windows Mobile 5 OS for Smartphones. So all Compact, Vario and iPaq owners chill out! The Korean manufacturer has gained significant experience with smartphones already. Remember the interesting i300 model equipped with a 3GB hard disk or its improved version i310 with an 8GB hard disk presented at this year's CeBIT fair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The classification of Samsung i320 as a smartphone is entirely and only mine so do not feel obliged to agree with it. According to my opinion it does not belong to the communicators' class, mainly due to the OS used and then also because of the absence of touchscreen display. Generally, there are rather few smartphones equipped with a Windows Mobile OS for Smartphones on the market (compared to the amount of Nokia models based on the Symbian OS): these are Qtek 8310 and 8500 (known as HTC MTeoR) plus the currently presented Samsung model and Motorola MPx220, which however features an older OS version. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Is it black or not?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 is 111 mm long and 59 mm wide. It forms a rectangle with slightly convex sides. Thanks to its slimness (11.5 mm), it is a pleasure to carry the phone in one's pocket. Its 95 grams are another reason for this device to be comparable in size to common mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When I first touched Samsung i320 I was impressed by both its brilliant construction and the materials it is made of. In spite of its slimness the phone has a solid body, which does not give out a creak even if pressed or twisted. The thin part covering the battery does not show any gaps either; just on the contrary, it holds firmly as if having been fixed for good. If you do not change SIM cards frequently, I am convinced it is going to keep its qualities during the entire life of the phone. I have to confess that I have a soft spot for both the materials used on Samsung i320 and its color. The device is dark-black when looked at under artificial light or in twilight. At the same time, it gets a unique reddish nuance when placed under direct sunlight. It is only the glossy cover of the display that will definitely require regular care, as it catches fingerprints all over. In any case Samsung i320 looks classy and stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Located on the right side of the device are a couple of connectors protected by rubber covers, the latter being caught to the body of the phone. The bottom cover protects the system connector, which assures the electrical connection of the synchronizing cable. A little bit upper is located the earphones slot, different from the standard jack connector. Unfortunately, the Samsung i320 model our team obtained for testing was not accompanied by an earphone set. Yet, I believe such will be available in every standard phone package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper one of the double keys opens the system menu, in which profiles can be altered, broadcast switched off etc. A longer press on the same key locks the keypad. The bottom key can be programmed to separately react to short and longer press. On the opposite side you will find another double key, which regulates the earphones volume levels. Hidden in the top edge is the Infrared port, while the microphone is to be found in the bottom of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most attractive element on the rear side of Samsung i320 is the digital camera lens. Pay a closer attention to the tiny strip inside the frame. Here you will find a highly powerful LED. The camera separates two speakers, which are meant to create a stereo effect. The result is rather poor though. Beneath the plastic cover you will find a Li-Ion battery of unknown capacity, a MicroSD memory card slot (TransFlash), and a SIM card slot. The fact that the removal of the SIM card does not require removal of the battery, while the exchange of the memory card does require this operation is quite interesting. Once the SIM card has been removed and replaced, the phone restarts itself automatically.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: are 65K colors sufficient?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A greater part of the phone's front is occupied by a display of a resolution of 320 x 240 pixels. Samsung has become fond of horizontal displays, a fact I do not mind at all, especially after my experience with Samsung X820. Horizontal display might create certain difficulties only in case that you prefer to use the standard Today screen layout as some items may remain hidden below the visible display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As I consider the amount of 65K colors fully sufficient, displays featuring 262K or even 16 millions colors make no difference. The font is sharp enough for such a screen size. As to contrast, brightness and color deepness Samsung i320's display deserves the highest possible mark. Its visibility remains good even at direct sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Non-traditional keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The hardware QWERTY keypad is one of the most interesting elements on this new Samsung smartphone. It consists of 37 keys distributed in a regular matrix of ten keys in a line. Only the bottom line has 7 keys instead of ten. Number keys are located in the center of the keypad, being at the same time clearly divided by a silver transparent background. White backlighting comes out through the keys' legends only, while number keys' glow is inverted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys are manufactured of solid plastic material. No swings. Press is exact, response is clear. Despite the fact that user's thumb covers nearly a third of Samsung i320's keypad, typing is surprisingly easy. One of the explanations is the abovementioned exact press. Let's not forget to mention that the width of the phone also facilitates keypad work significantly. If you hold the handset with your right hand, you will have no difficulties to reach any of the keys with your right thumb. In other words, Samsung i320's keypad does not require the use of two hands at the time, like the case of Qtek 9100 and all other devices based on the HTC Wizard platform, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The form of Samsung i320's keys (higher in the center, lower in the margins) is another factor that facilitates typing. The hardest-to-reach keys are the ones situated close to the right margin of the keypad. To press them one needs to either fold their thumb quite unnaturally, or move the entire phone towards the end of their palm. Whatever remarks I might have, however, I stick to my first statement, that is, Samsung i320's keypad is brilliant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320's five-way navigation key together with the buttons surrounding it is significantly bigger than the rest of the keys. The main controller is accompanied by a confirm button, two context keys, a back-to-screen key, and a correction key. Red and green call keys are present, of course. The context keys could gleam in three different colors: standard white, blue and red (the last two in particular situations). Unfortunately, a configuration of two colors at the time is impossible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware or Samsung secrets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung keeps in deep secret the type of the processor its new model is driven by. According to the system information in the phone alone it is a PXA27x processor, that is, a product of Intel, which is however a rather strange finding, considering the fact that Samsung manufacturers its own processors for pocket computers and communicators based on the Windows Mobile platform. Anyway, we did not manage to find details on Samsung i320's processor operating frequency on the Internet, either. In the end, it was the TCPMPlayer video application that gave away the precious information that the processor used in this new Samsung model is basically PXA27x. The phone is said to work at 420 MHz. I could not be positive about how accurate this information is (common PXA27x processors work at 416 MHz), but I tend to believe it as the phone is generally pretty fast and is able to play alright rather high bitrate videos. Considering the fact that 420 MHz is a frequency worth praises, the lack of official information on the processor frequency remains a mystery for me.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The work of the processor is supplemented by a combination of ROM/RAM of 128 MB / 64 MB. Accessible user memory is highly competitive: 122 MB / 52 MB, allowing for extensive downloads of applications, megapixel photos, and sound copying. You could even fit in a shorter movie, a music album etc. When in need of more memory-consuming applications or multimedia, use the slot for microSD (TransFlash) memory cards. Samsung i320 features a function that permits access to memory card via Mass Storage. In other words, the phone can also be used as a portable disk. The only inconvenience is that you should always have a non-standard cable with you. Both phone memory and the memory card are also accessible (even if slower) through TCP/IP and ActiveSync protocols. Picture copying, ringtones saving etc. is a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 is equipped with Bluetooth for wireless data transfers, which I tested using a wireless earphone. Synchronization made me sweat a bit, but I suspect the Bluetooth receiver is the one to blame. The phone works well with GPRS too. An Infrared port is available as well. Samsung i320 does not support Wi-Fi connectivity, however. If you need to work with such, you would better go for Qtek 8310 instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Operational System<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When Microsoft launched the new OS Windows Mobile 5, they spoke about a joint version for Smartphone and PocketPC, which made many users believe that they would be able to install applications designed for PocketPC into their Smartphones. This, of course, is impossible, as applications for PocketPC require the use of a touchpad display as a basic interface. This is why application developers continue to create their products in two parallel versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to me, the use of a Smartphone version of the Windows Mobile OS is one of the greatest mistakes on behalf of Samsung. Why? The small amount of available applications. See for yourself: browse the Internet and take a look at the biggest software e-shop Handango. Here you will find a database of 12,805 applications for PocketPC, while Smartphone has exactly 1,702 (to make the picture clearer: in the same shop there are mere 6,181 applications for Symbian OS). In short, PocketPC offers more alternatives, of which each paid one is accompanied by at least one free alternative. Only one of every six available applications is designed for Smartphone. Besides, the OS used in Samsung i320 lacks common Office applications for editing text or spreadsheet documents. For that purpose you will have to find additional (usually paid) alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all, I do not have any other significant notes regarding the OS used in Samsung i320. The 5 version has undergone major improvements compared to the previous one. At the same time, certain important elements have remained untouched. What I do not find user-friendly is the complicated setup of this system. The entire Settings section is chaotic and difficult to work with. Let me give you an example: the sound setup. In the Profiles section the phone provides the possibility to select only one ringing type within each particular profile (vibration, ringing with vibration...), while ringtones are set up in the Sounds section. What's worse, here you will find sound profiles, which totally change previously made settings. It is just unnecessarily too complicated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speed Samsung i320 works at is worth an applause, even if the device sometimes shows certain delays when shifting calendar views quickly. As a whole, however, the new Samsung Smartphone does not slow down even when several applications are left running in background.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>More software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has created its own version of the Today main display. In the first case almost the entire screen is occupied by an attractive picture, which however makes work with it less user-friendly. The second theme already contains a table including a list of received messages, upcoming events etc. The respective panel can easily be hidden and reopened according to the user's wish. An original setup is available as well. A novelty is the Launcher application, which speeds up access to most frequently used applications. Launcher is fully configurable. It is opened through a longer press of the Home key (marked with a house).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting element is the D-Day application. This creates events, which can be additionally accompanied by particular date and name. And that is it. Alarm that would alert you about saved events is not available. As far as the application Picsel Viewer is considered, I myself find it rather useless. It is basically a picture browser which doesn't outperform the ones featured by the Pictures &amp; Video application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another curious application is Voice Assist. It reminds the speaker independent voice dialing used in some of the latest Nokia models. Samsung i320 does not require preliminary voice recording. You simply need to pronounce the respective name and Voice Assist will look it up for you. Yet, bare in mind the fact that being an English application Voice Assist requires the use of English names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other applications worth mentioning are the unit converter and the stopwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Present are also all other famous applications obligatory for Windows Mobile: calendar, task manager, file manager, games, Windows Media Player etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook and calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 will excite you with provided stand-by and smooth phonebook search. When the phone is on stand-by, you only need to start typing the name of the desired contact. The phone reacts lightning fast and runs filtering immediately. To start dialing, press the green receiver key. Should you dial a new, unknown number, use the silver and number keys. Samsung i320 will start filtering existing contacts anyway, but at the same time it will also display the entire phone number you have entered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As memory used by the phonebook is shared, the latter basically disposes of unlimited capacity. Each contact can be assigned 55 fields! I doubt anyone will ever manage to make use of all of them, but having the possibility to do so is delighting. All contacts together with the fields attached to them synchronize with Outlook seamlessly. Speaking about phone functions in particular, I have to confess that in Samsung i320 I miss call filtering by pre-selected profiles - a drawback, of which Windows Mobile has been suffering from the very beginning of its existence. Will Microsoft programmers ever manage to eliminate it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated main speaker is of good-quality except for the bass tones that - according to me - could have been a little bit more expressed. Samsung i320 works smoothly with Bluetooth, which I tested using a Nokia BH-200 earphone. You can also share calls with people around you thanks to the integrated loudspeaker. Incoming calls are alerted by vibration and ringing (standard polyphonic melody or MP3 file).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no problem to save a favorite song of yours and consequently use it as an alert of messages or calls. Speaking about MP3, it is quite a pity that Samsung i320's alarm clock does not work with MP3 files as alarm alternatives. Yet, there is a workaround solution: create an event in the calendar, assign it an alert in MP3 format and use it as an alarm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages: email is the king<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text, multimedia and email messages are all covered by the application Inbox. Automatic synchronization of emails from Outlook as well as the creation of several separate email accounts is of course available. Samsung i320 is compatible with POP3 and IMAP protocols, including their secured versions. As usual, the email client provides automatic check of the mailbox in pre-set time intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text messages are pretty standard. Selection of multiple addressees and typing longer messages are both available. As I mentioned above, the fact that the memory used for saving messages is shared, the phone is able to store hundreds of sent and received messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor is a far more interesting application. Besides text and pictures it also permits you to insert into a MMS a voice note, a video, a favorite item from the Internet browser, a contact, and a reminder. It is fun, but make sure you arm yourself with patience if you need to set up data transfer settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Practical application of data transfers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 offers GPRS and EDGE data transfers, both in Class 10. Both serve well email transfers, communication via favorite messenger applications, Internet browsing, general file transfers via FTP, etc. In other words, there are plenty of fully competitive alternatives available compared to the applications offered by a standard PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile in its Smartphone version features a relatively good Internet Explorer. It opens graphic web pages and manages pretty successfully to redistribute information into one column. It is here, working with the Internet browser, where I most miss the touchpad display available in classic communicators. Samsung i320's Internet Explorer also opens WAP pages. Despite that, the manufacturer has additionally installed a special WAP browser - a decision I like a lot, as browsing WAP pages with Internet Explorer sometimes implies an unnecessary switch to respective Internet versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also offers a basic MSN Messenger. Should you decide not to make use of this chat application, feel free to install a multi-protocol application instead. Samsung i320's keypad is comfortable enough to make instant messaging quite a pleasant activity. What's more, it is cheaper than calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any other alternatives for data transfers are related to additionally available applications, like RSS readers, FTP clients, applications for watching or listening to streaming media etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera and multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has equipped its new smartphone with a camera with 1.3 MP resolution. Even so, you will hardly manage to take sharp images unless there is enough daylight, only then the shutter speed is fast enough. The later in the afternoon and the less natural light available, the harder it becomes for Samsung i320 to take pictures of satisfying quality. If light conditions are favorable, resulting photos will probably be quite good. The Samsung i320's camera uses a low compression and the end result is slightly larger picture files but with the added benefit of a better quality. Unfortunately, there is no dedicated macro mode for shooting from close distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happen to like filming, you will surely appreciate the Samsung i320's ability to shoot video in a resolution of 320 x 240 pixels. Not bad at all, is it? The majority of all currently offered mobile phones achieve a resolution of no more than 176 x 144 pixels. In the camera menu of Samsung i320 you will also find plenty of effects, like a smooth digital zoom, brightness control etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like every device featuring an open OS Samsung i320 has an almost unlimited support for multimedia applications. It offers a memory cards slot, with capacity depending on the user's wish only. Thanks to the built-in Windows Media Player you will be able to play video in WMV format as well as music in MP3 or WMA formats. Should you prefer applications supporting MPEG (PocketTV) or DivX (TCMP Player), feel free to install them additionally. Result will always depend on each particular movie and its compression. I was pleasantly surprised when Samsung i320 managed to play even a non-converted video designed for common PC with a bitrate of approximately 1 MB and resolution of 600 pixels sideward. I just had to open the TCMP Player and select Intel XScale as a Video Driver. Nevertheless, I do not recommend you to play high-resolution films on a display of 320 pixels, as this will eat you up a great amount of memory. You'd better use one of the numerous user-friendly applications for video conversion (PocketDivXEncoder, for example). Video sound is backed up by two speakers and is pretty good. Earphones fans will probable remain disappointed as Samsung i320 lacks a standard connector.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life depends on you<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 is able to fully function during a period of three entire days. Should you use all its applications frequently, however, you will hardly do without charging every night. The phone can also be charged through USB (while synchronizing, for example). Samsung i320 can even be charged through a USB 2.0 connector without the need of a PC switched on. I miss the standard miniUSB connector, which is a standard element of the equipment of HTC smartphones and communicators, as this frees me of having to think about carrying the charger always with me. What's more, a miniUSB cable is possible to find among the extras in nearly every PC package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Small but powerful<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i320 is one of the best designed current smartphones on the mobile market. Since the very beginning of this review I have been trying to yank out at least one significant drawback of the phone - yet unsuccessfully. Those of you in need of Wi-Fi should ignore this new Samsung smartphone. All the rest, make sure you take into account Samsung i320 when you decide to get yourself a new smartphone. The new Korean device has a brilliantly manufactured body, good synchronization abilities; it provides Internet access and works with emails. Basically, besides the obvious lack of widely available free applications, it's got all it takes to keep your communication needs satisfied.</paragraph>
