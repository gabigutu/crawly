			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W980 is among those gadgets with enough class and guts to hope for a long run in the spotlight. A Walkman-series phone, armed with 8GB of internal memory, 3 megapixel camera and a built-in accelerometer simply cannot go unnoticed. Now, add the exotic FM transmitter feature and the light effects and you can feel the tingle of excitement of having a real star in your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can bet that we are already working on a full-blown review of the sleek clamshell but before it's ready to serve, here is a quick taster of our first impressions. It should give you the first idea of what the Sony Ericsson W980 is good for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, check out some photos of the newest addition to the Walkman family. It looks all set to become the flagship of the Sony Ericsson music feature-phone portfolio and has some pretty high expectations to match. The question is whether Sony Ericsson W980 is capable of going that extra step towards stardom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W980 is finished in nice glossy plastic that gives it those sleek and sexy looks. Its mirror-like front surface is not the easiest to work with but is visually impressive. The main problem here is fingerprint smudges. Those are a huge issue with the W980 and we had to spend almost as much time cleaning the handset as we did using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W980 stands at 92 x 46 x 16.9 mm, which is compact enough for a clamshell phone. It seems rather large when opened but is in fact very pocket-friendly when closed. Besides, it weighs the delightful 100 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of Sony Ericsson W980 looks as if it holds no controls whatsoever. When the handset is dormant, the whole front is just one solid piece of opaque mirror. As soon as you press a key however, eye-pleasing illuminations appear to mark the location of the touch-sensitive controls. Those are in charge of the music player and the FM radio without even opening the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lock slider on the side of Sony Ericsson W980 that comes in handy for avoiding accidental presses. The volume rocker is also placed on the side, as usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We however didn't like the Walkman key location much. It's placed under the cover, so you have to open the flip to use it. It would have been much more comfortable somewhere on the side, so you can use the Shake control feature without bothering to flip up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower part of the front is decked with a transparent stripe. It illuminates to create light effects to the currently playing music track. Those light effects are also available when you play some of the preinstalled games but in different color. We know it's only eye-candy with no actual use but that doesn't make it any less cool, does it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the Sony Ericsson W980 reveals the 2.2" QVGA display. The moderately sized screen doesn't quite befit a flagship device that the W980 is supposed to be. It is capable of showing up to 262K colors and really won us over with picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Sony Ericsson W980 has rather extraordinary looks (very much like the low-end R306 radio) with its round buttons. It is however quite comfortable to use due to the large enough keys and sufficient space between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's difficult though to say the same about the soft keys that are too tiny for our taste. They are a nuisance to use if you have larger fingers - pressing some of the neighboring keys seems imminent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature in Sony Ericsson W980 is the ambient light sensor that is placed slightly below the display. It takes care of adjusting the display brightness according to the current lighting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing to note at the rear is the 3 megapixel camera lens. Sony Ericsson didn't bother putting either auto focus or flash, so you probably understand you're not to expect miracles of it. Its placement is also quite inconvenient as it is exactly where your index finger will normally rest when shooting. You will need to work out a proper way of holding the W980 when taking pictures.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface Walkman style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in Sony Ericsson W980 is almost identical to the one we found on its smaller brother - the W760. It has the company's typical feature phone styling, all niceties included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W980 has four different menu layouts. Except the traditional 4 x 3 grid, the main menu can now be diversified with a couple of alternative views: rotating and single icon. Plus, if a Flash Lite theme you have installed supports another layout, you can enjoy that as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons in Sony Ericsson W980 come in playful colorful and offer nice animations. There are a number of animated transition effects throughout the interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to some of the most frequently-used functions. It also takes care of multi-tasking on Sony Ericsson W980.The other features of the Activity menu include quick access to recent events and a nice web menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM transmitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W980 is the first phone we've got a hold of to feature an FM transmitter. Quite understandably, we were excited to see it in action. As it turned out, it does quite well and manages to outperform even some of the dedicated FM transmitting devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the sound transmitted isn't strictly Hi-Fi one but it is does the job. A pleasant surprise was that it transfers the artist and the song name via RDS. The FM transmitter does a great job in a car and it can be very useful during a party too. We are pretty sure it will be put to good use in practical jokes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When first announced, the Sony Ericsson W980 was also expected to have another cool feature concerning the radio. Back there in Barcelona the prototypes used to have a built-in antenna that allowed listening to music without plugging in a pair of headphones. However this feature has been dropped for some reason and now the W980 is no different than any other phone in this department.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is a letdown<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Regrettably, Sony Ericsson W980 follows the trend of recent Walkman phones in terms of camera performance. This means it has an oversimplified and not really user-friendly camera interface. The picture quality is also unimpressive. In fact, the lack of auto focus actually tells the whole story here - Sony Ericsson never meant to make the W980 a worthy cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are somewhat missing the days when Walkman phones had one of the best cameras on the market (think W800) as that made them really tempting multimedia devices. As things stand now, you have to choose between imaging and music capabilities with most recent Sony Ericsson handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is the thing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Although it's probably the most important feature of Sony Ericsson W980, we chose to leave the music player for the end of this preview. This way we could give it the proper treatment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There seem to be no real changes to the music player compared to the latest Walkman phones. On the other hand, we can hardly think of something that can be improved in the Walkman 3.0 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It boasts a great number of supported file formats and automatically sorts your tracks by various filters. The well known step by step tack filtering is also present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two of the coolest features of Walkman handsets - SenseMe and Shake control - are also aboard the Sony Ericsson W980. SenseMe groups your tracks by mood giving a nice and fresh way of exploring your music library. Shake control allows you to change tracks and even shuffle your entire playlist by a simple flick of the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use Shake control is press the Walkman key and shake the phone forward (for going to the next track) or backward (for going a track back). A quick succession of the two moves does the shuffle trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally here is a short video demonstrating how the music player can be controlled by only using the external controls and display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So far, so good - we are quite pleased with the performance of the Sony Ericsson W980. Its exotic features - the FM transmitter and elaborate light effects - give it a distinct taste, while the good user interface makes sure all the basics are covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are, as usual, very pleased with the Walkman music player but the camera is quite a bit of a letdown. Still all in all, the first impressions Sony Ericsson W980 makes are really positive. Stay tuned and don't miss the full review for all those questions left unanswered. Rest assured, we're just as curious as you are if the new Walkman highflier can deliver on all counts.</paragraph>
