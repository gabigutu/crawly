			<paragraph>You've probably wondered what Vertu mobile phones are all about. After all they are absurdly over-priced, extremely under-powered, and many of those look somewhat? ok, let's say that most people don't fall in love with them instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we certainly have given the issue some thought and that is why we decided to give two of these babies a quick test drive. Dealing with mobile phones that are worth an arm and a leg is not what we do on a regular basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only a glance at the price tag clearly shows that Vertu phones are status symbols rather than plain communication devices. With prices starting from almost $5000 they clearly show that their owners are people, who hardly ask for the prices when shopping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what do you really get for this kind of money? It is the latest technology indeed but not in the sense of being the most feature-loaded devices you can imagine. The technology in Vertu phones lies somewhere else - in their construction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The materials and technologies used in these phones are nowhere else to be seen on the mobile phone market. We are talking about the ceramic laser-etched keypad and the sapphire crystal protective layer. And don't say that Nokia 8800 models already have that as we are talking about the whole phone this time, not just the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another unique Vertu handset feature is that ruby bearings are placed under each of the keys of the keypad to improve the precision, smoothness and longevity of their action. At least the manufacturers say that it does so and after a short time spent with this keypad we have no reason to disbelieve them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame of Vertu Constellation series phones is made of the Liquid metal, which is twice as hard as the stainless steel and yet lighter than that. Still don't get us wrong - these babes are surprisingly heavy for their dimensions. Standing 103 x 44 x 15.7, they weigh anywhere between 140 to 163 grams, depending on the material used for their finishing. This however is not necessary bad as this makes them look far more solid and durable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is opened by a specific mechanism. The round lock on the back panel is meant to be opened and closed with the key included in the retail package but in practice any suitably shaped object will do the trick. In all fairness we have to admit that this looks like a little improvement to the Siemens ME45's lock mechanism which we saw back in 2001st, or at least to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last really impressive thing about the Vertu phones is the built-in Yamaha speaker, optimized for real Hi-Fi performance. It gives the handsets really distinctive sound that can hardly be confused with another phone. After all if you are a Vertu owner, showing off is what you surely like to do once in a while and the loudspeaker really facilitates that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 256K TFT square display with a resolution of 208 x 208 pixels is identical to the ones found on Nokia 8800 and is surely not something to boast about. We do believe that a phone of this class deserved something better, not to mention larger.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Concierge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main highlight in Vertu phone's features is the concierge - a 24-hour service, accessed by a single press of the dedicated button. It connects you to an operator that can help you with virtually anything you need - be it plane ticket booking or hotel reservations there is an expert out there for everything. Furthermore it is available in several languages, so despite that the company is based in London English is not your only option. It is hard to imagine that a person who buys Vertu won't have a secretary or a personal assistant for such purposes but nonetheless it is probably good to always have another option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Vertu Constellation series models run on the Nokia S40 3rd edition user interface. It's far from being out-of-date but it is not the best looking user-interface either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rich features also aren't really Vertu Constellation's thing. The quad-band device features a decent set of GPRS-enabled features including five applications plus a few organizing options but doesn't get anywhere near to actually deserving the price tag. But then again it was never meant to do so in terms of features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So the Vertu Constellation handsets are surely not something you can pass by without noticing it. They are meant to be distinctive and fulfill the task perfectly. However it is once again to be noted here that they are far from being regular mobile phones. Is it worth it? Well if it goes well with the color of your Wiesmann it probably does.</paragraph>
