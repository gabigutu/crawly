			<paragraph>After three long years of waiting we face the RAZR V3 successor: the slim and refined Motorola RAZR2 V8. Sporting a full metal jacket with gradating hues of dark pearl gray, the RAZR2 V8 is made to impress. With two high-quality displays with QVGA resolution, plus quad-band GSM support, two megapixel camera and stereo Bluetooth, it?s a handset that delivers functionality besides style. As we're writing this review, the top-of-the-bill RAZR2 V8 Luxury edition is on its way to the shelves too, with a gold-plated body and soft snake-skin-like back for those who like their calls with a pinch of exotic glamour. Join us on this review as we discover what the Motorola RAZR2 V8 is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR2 V8 has a truly graceful silhouette, but the 11.9 mm of thickness get to be appreciated even more considering the clamshell form factor. Clean shape and rounded edges make the slim handset look solid, yet elegant. It does manage to impress at first sight, but more on that after the jump.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid thin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the flip closed, the large 2" external display takes possession of almost the entire outer panel. The 256K-color TFT display has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. Its size and looks truly deserve admirations, however this time all credit goes to its touch-sensitive capabilities. It is a tricky matter, as the display itself is not a touchscreen. Only visible upon very close examination, three touch sensitive keys can be spotted overlaying the external display. It is for the first time that Motorola incorporates these keys over the display, instead of placing them under it. They come with haptic feedback - meaning slight vibrations denote every keypress. However, the keys are active only in player mode, controlling basic player functions like play, pause, forward, etc. It's a pity they cannot perform other tasks. Anyway, it's a praiseworthy innovation that holds a lot of promise of expanding the possibilities of the external display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is the 2 megapixel camera lens. With no other keys or elements on the front panel, V8 looks really cool and sleek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open the flip, there is no way for the size of the main display to go unnoticed. The TFT internal display of QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels) totals 256K colors on a 2.2" diagonal. Above the display is the stylish long narrow opening of the earpiece, which looks like an elegant extension of the main display. The only thing that's ruining the good impression here is that when opened the clamshell looks stunningly large - much like the impression you get when you open the Nokia N76 for the first time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trademark etched keypad is really nicely done and, besides the usual navigation and alphanumeric buttons, it also has a dedicated music player key right above the call key. The large comfortable keys offer great touch orientation. The round navigation key is a pleasure to use, matching the overall user-friendliness of the whole keypad. The keypad is placed closer to the bottom of the phone, compared to other RAZRs -V3i, V3, V3xx and maxx V6. This provides better typing experience and general phone handling. Below the keypad there's a rubber stripe serving as a cushion for the flip. It also keeps the display off the keyboard in closed position, to finally get rid of the irritating keypad imprints on the screen. RAZR2 V8 is also the first phone in the family to have the flip almost equal in size with the lower body, resulting in a symmetric clamshell design. The characteristic chin is a lot subtler here, almost non-existent compared to Motorola RAZR V3i, V3, V3xx and maxx V6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Motorola RAZR2 V8 features the universal port for plugging the charger, headset or data cable. Alongside is the volume rocker, which also provides quick access to ringing profiles in standby. It has additional functions regarding incoming text messages, but that's to come later on. Right below the external volume keys is the side select key, also used to operate the camera when the flip is closed. This side select key can be used to select items when you operate the handset with the flip closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset accommodates the large voice command key. Right above it, nicely integrated within the hinge is the neck/wrist strap eyelet, styled in silver. The volume rocker, the side select key and the voice command key all have a metallic surface that refracts light to shape various geometric patterns. A similar effect is observed when you look at the front panel from different angles - right above the secondary display, the Motorola logo seems to sparkle light, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the closed clamshell is completely bare, while at the bottom of the handset the dual mouthpiece grill is to be seen only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A shining Motorola logo midway the back panel attracts attention immediately. The better part of the rear is the battery cover. It is made of matt metal though it looks like plastic. The rest of the rear panel is also made of metal and houses the external antenna plug, as well as the dark blue loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Motorola BX40 Li-Ion battery is revealed once you remove the back cover. It has a capacity of 770 mAh and the manufacturer promises up to 330 h of standby time and up to 7 h and 30 minutes of talk time. These are quite optimistic claims, honestly. In reality, the battery lasts around 2-3 full days in a 3G network, depending on how intense the usage is. The SIM card slot is placed on the right, nothing interesting here. Oh, and don't be looking for a memory card slot - this phone has none, just like the original V3 RAZR.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good news on Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Generally, we are pleased with both the ergonomics of the Motorola V8 and the solid feel of the device. Its shape and dimensions make it nice to talk on, too. However, we did notice a minor flaw and it concerns opening the clamshell single-handedly. There is no recess where you can rest your finger to open the flip. Additionally, given the polished metal casing, the handset somewhat easily slips off your fingers. The folding mechanism works like a charm though: the hinge holds softly and evenly to ensure a smooth flip open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With dual display handsets we've seen enough small external displays boasting thousands of colors but offering dismal legibility. This is definitely not the case with the outer display of Motorola V8. Calling it secondary will be quite an insult actually, as the sole difference between the two screens is 0.2 inches in diagonal. Color rendering and legibility under direct sunlight are splendid. It is important to mention that both displays have one and the same backlighting source. However, only the main display is customizable, while the external one cannot have its brightness adjusted. Additionally, the display specs claim 40% of backlighting goes to the external and 60% is marked off for the internal screen. The inner 2.2" QVGA TFT display itself is stunningly crisp and bright, offers vivid colors and is legible even at the medium brightness level. All in all, we are very pleased with the displays of Motorola V8 and think they're worth a wholehearted thumbs-up. The keyboard has even, but rather soft white backlighting, which is not of much use. One can't help frowning at the difference, comparing it to the bright main display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>CrystalTalk - real-like voice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>CrystalTalk, a proprietary Motorola technology is here to greatly enhance quality of calls. CrystalTalk combines voice enhancement technologies like microphone noise reduction, noise adaptive speaker enhancements, and on some products - a full duplex speakerphone. All enhancements improve the clarity and intelligibility of speech in noisy environments. Striving to deliver loudness and maintain quality simultaneously, CrystalTalk adjusts the audio quality based on ambient noise conditions to provide the optimal conversational experience. Both the microphone and earpiece grill are of ample size but still look stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we managed to confirm it really does a great job. The caller voice was so clear and real, it almost felt like a face-to-face. Almost all of the background noise is suppressed. Other Motorola handsets to benefit from the CrystalTalk technology are Motorola V9, U9, W206, W213, W175, W180, W156, W160 and W510.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Motorola RAZR2 V8 ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our new speakerphone loudness test. More info on our test here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR2 V8 runs on the Linux Java 6.5 platform, which proves to be stable and fast, a conclusion supported by our extensive testing of the phone. More and more handsets are expected to come up with the LJ platform, and this seems to be the right direction for Motorola. However the recent announcement that Motorola will be acquiring 50% of UIQ from Sony Ericsson makes us think that a good number of UIQ-based phones will be on their way, too. Don't let the Linux designation fool you since the V8 is not a fully-fledged smartphone and it only allows installing Java apps. The very fast response and multitasking of the Motorola V8 had us wonder what processor it uses. Some reliable, yet uncorroborated sources claim it is a 500 MHz chip. Enough smart talk though, let's see what's on the menu. Motorola RAZR2 V8 has a standard home screen with options on the left soft key and main menu key on the right. The Options menu grants access to several important applications and settings, such as take picture, create message, change alert style, enable airplane mode, as well as customize home and set alarm. The Customize Home submenu allows for changing themes, shortcut keys, clock style, and date visibility on the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be viewed as a 3 x 3 icon grid or as a list. The sub-menus display in list view only. The main menu icons can be reordered or even moved to submenus in the Office tools or Multimedia sections. Creating a new folder in the main menu is just another handy option at your disposal. Detailed information about memory is available too. Three tabs show battery status as follows: the first tab provides a snapshot of memory usage; the second tab (phone memory) displays details about the memory used by contacts, messages, installed applications, pictures, music, videos, etc. The third tab is for the data memory and offers similar information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola V8 comes with two themes preinstalled - Alkali (default) and Plush, both fully customizable - call ringtones, message, email and IM alerts, as well as the calendar alarm can be modified. The same goes for the wallpaper, screensaver, power on/off screen and additional skins, if any.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is on par<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The V8 offers a very nice and friendly phonebook. The maximum capacity is 1000 contacts (much like the Motorola maxx V6), which can be sorted by either first or last name. Contacts are displayed as a list or thumbnails. In thumbnail view up to 5 contacts are shown with a photo, if any, on the left. In list view, 8 contacts with no pictures display on the screen. If you have a vast list of contacts but you use certain entries more frequently, filtering with the "Most Frequent" option will be of great help. Contacts can also be filtered based on email address and category (family, friends and work are the predefined contact categories, but users can create new ones too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When saving a contact, the user is offered five tabs for different fields. The first one is the Contact Details tab, which holds the first and last name, five different phone numbers, two emails, instant messaging ID, as well as an ICQ or Skype alias. It's this tab where contacts can be associated with a category too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab stores two postal addresses with fields for town, country and postcode. The next one is the Picture ID tab, which stores a contact's photo only. In the Alert tab you can set custom notifications. An interesting option available here is the "Private Contact" checkbox. Ticking it will keep the contact in the phone only and won't get it synced with a PC. The last one is the Notes tab where - quite conveniently - a voice note is at your disposal too. The other fields are standard - company, title, manager's name, assistant's name, URL, nickname, spouse, children, birthday, event alarm, anniversary - with alarm too - and zodiac complete the tally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Options menu under Contacts, there is a Create tab. It lets you choose the storing location: SIM or phone. A nice surprise lies in store though. Two other resourceful options are included: Create Message list and Create Email list. Both are there to make multi mailing or multi messaging a piece of cake. When creating a message list you are prompted to set the list name, add members, as well as assign category, if necessary. The list is stored in your contacts alphabetically. For example, if you named the list "My friends" it will appear among contacts starting with the letter M.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Talking to me?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default view of the calls log in V8 is the all calls view. Dialed, missed and answered calls however can be set to appear separately as well. Multiple calls to or from one and the same number are stored independently, instead of keeping the most recent one only. Call timers and a data counter are available too, with submenus offering detailed information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its Linux platform, RAZR2 V8 is yet another Motorola to offer a very handy feature called Talking Phone. An aid for the vision-impaired or a boost to handsfree operation, Talking Phone provides voice assistance throughout the phone interface. Users can enable it for various aspects of handling the phone, including caller ID, menu, contact list, digits, etc. There are even email and text message readouts. Those who love fooling around should be warned that there's no censorship and the application will read out just anything. Obscenities or particularly naughty texts could make them wish some things went without saying on the RAZR2 V8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're at it, Talking Phone is probably the most notable feature in the messaging department. Otherwise, the RAZR2 V8 has pretty much standard SMS and MMS functionality. When writing a text message, a character counter is available. It also indicates the number of separate messages to be sent should the 160-character limit be exceeded. Of course, the iTap editor is there too. We do like it better than T9, for its superior user-friendliness and handling of new vocabulary entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New text messages can be viewed and read on the external display, but replying with the flip closed is limited, you can only return a message using the available SMS templates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you enter a picture or file, the text message turns into MMS. The MMS editor offers no novelties either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email completes the messaging capabilities of the RAZR2 V8. Incoming emails have a dedicated Inbox. The email client offers plenty of setting options and support for encryptions, and we're quite pleased with it. A readout option is settable as well. Additionally, the phone offers full Exchange server synchronization.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>File management and multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the core non-phone features of the Motorola V8 is the MP3 player. It has a dedicated button on the keypad, above the call key. Although it doesn't have the lavish user interface of high-end Walkman handsets, the music player in the RAZR2 V8 offers a pretty rich palette of options. Additionally, the quality external display and touch-sensitive keys make browsing tracks and playlists a real pleasure. Most of the playlist options to look for in a music-centered phone, are available here too. Among them are recently played files, artists, albums, genres and composers. Tracks are automatically sorted based on the information from ID3 tags. Alongside the fully customizable playlists, the music player offers auto-repeat, shuffle, bass boost with seven levels and the specially developed Spatial Audio effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Spatial Audio gives sound considerable depth but keeping the Bass Boost at medium level is a must, otherwise frequent distortion peaks are inevitable. Spatial Audio gets most appreciated with soul music. Searching audio content is possible, thanks to the integrated search engine. Song title, artist, album, genre and composer are the search attributes you can apply when looking for a track. Listening to music in the background is as comfortable as in normal mode, with a navigation toolbar still available on the home screen when the player is minimized. You can browse the menu and use the other phone features. Pressing the end key to exit the current application takes you back to home screen with the minimized player. Alternatively, pressing the dedicated player key on the keypad will launch the music library with the now running track. Once you have finished working with the phone, the external display with touch sensitive keys takes over handling the player upon closing the flip. The Bluetooth enabled RAZR2 V8 supports the A2DP profile for using wireless stereo headsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is the regular Motorola one offering standard functionality. You can fast-forward and rewind, play in fullscreen mode. The spatial audio stereo effect and bass boost are also available in the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File manager is located under Office Tools. Its default view is list with small icons. Other available views are details, thumbnail and preview pane. We find the thumbnail view very handy, indeed. Browsing your content with the file manager is just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated image gallery; the file manager is used for browsing photos. Each photo can also be set as wallpaper, screensaver, and added to a new or existing contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing pictures is also done here; there is no dedicated application. Rotating, cropping, resizing, styling or adding sounds are the options to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mere 2 megapixel and video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera with no autofocus, nor flash, is more of an ornament than an important feature in Motorola V8. The camera icon itself is not in the main menu, but out-of-the-way in the Multimedia section. There you will find the video camera icon, too. Another option to start the camera is through the Options menu on the home screen. The side select key, right under the volume rocker, serves as a shutter key when the flip is closed and the camera is active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When shooting, you can zoom in up to 8x, but digital zoom is not of much use. You won't get more than just smudged and blurry subjects. An Auto timer with 5 or 10 second delay is one of the programmable options of the camera. Another is Multi-Shot allowing 4, 6 and 8 shots in burst mode with a 1.5-second interval. The must-have camera settings are here, including shutter tone (can be turned off), name, auto-save, as well as four image resolutions with three quality levels. A nice extra is the option to auto-send image via email, immediately after taking it. Sounds like it could inspire paparazzi-like behavior at posh get-togethers. The camera quality is really ok. Shooting landscapes or distant subjects produces slightly out-of-focus images which lack detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically, closer subjects look better and provide more detail. The same applies for pictures taken with sufficient light. The colors are spot on and some of our shots looked as good as if a polarized filter was used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indoor photo tests show relatively good results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video camera mode actually uses the camera interface. Apart from the option to switch off sound recording in a video clip, the video camera setup offers resolution and quality options. Video is recorded at 30fps in QCIF resolution. The video length can be unlimited but another couple of clip length settings are available: MMS short or MMS long for the impatient to send the file immediately via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A sample video clip taken with the Motorola RAZR2 V8 is available here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing and connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides GPRS class 10 and EDGE class 12 for fast data transfers and content-streaming, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as microUSB v2.0 and Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP. There is no Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated HTML Opera 8.5 browser offers good performance. Pages can be viewed full screen with no menus showing. The browser supports HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0 content. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the display settings of the browser the font size, pop-ups, scrollbars, images, sound, JavaScript support, and plug-ins are customizable. Goodies don't end here - a download manager is at hand for downloading content such as pictures, clips, files, etc. There are two tabs in the download manager, one for the content downloaded through the browser and for the content received via Bluetooth. And, finally, up to five different browser windows can be opened. Switching between windows is done with the # and * keys. It's probably one of the best browsers used in a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR V8 supports Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP profile, allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. The Bluetooth modem profile for accessing the Internet on a PC or notebook computer is among the options, as well. Furthermore, the RAZR2 V8 cannot be set as permanently visible to other Bluetooth devices; the only option available is to set it as "Discoverable for 3 minutes". Pity, it's much like in RAZR V3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local sync is with Outlook and PC, while remote synchronization works with Exchange server. There are several USB connection modes - media sync, memory device, modem and USB print.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications: more than enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola V8 offers adequate time-management features and a nice assortment of additional applications. Under Office Tools in the main menu, several applications are available: File Manager, Calendar, Motosync, Download manager, Alarm clock, World Clock, Calculator, IM client, Task list, Notepad and Google. Let us focus on the calendar, alarm clock and world time, as well as with the to-do list and notepad. The nice and user-friendly Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. Adding a new calendar event opens a menu of four tabs. The first tab is for entering event details such as type, subject, location, date, time, etc. The second tab has a note field only. The third tab is for setting event priority and the last one is for repetition only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm Clock has three alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday, as well as weekdays or weekends only. The snooze time and alarm volume are settable as well. The World clock shows the time in three cities simultaneously. Map view and comparison view are the options to display the three clocks. We find the comparison view more helpful, with the current time highlighted and other times of the day also listed for an hour-by-hour comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is the standard Motorola application offering the basic functions. The To-do List is another application under Office Tools. Tasks can be two types: simple tasks and phone calls and can be set reminders when their deadline expires. You can also write and store notes on your RAZR2 V8, using Notepad under Office Tools. Voice notes can be recorded too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also some extra applications located in the Games and Applications section, namely Motorola Backup, Motorola Setup, Motorola Text, Rough Guides Mobile, as well as, Football and Sudoku.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An intriguing feature is that you can place the various applications and even games throughout the different submenus as you please. There is no problem, for example, to move a game to the Office folder - it's all flexible, it's all up to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backup is an application providing wireless backup of your contacts on the Motorola backup server, plus the option to manage contacts online. Having set the feature, all you need is a GPRS connection, for the data to get synced. Similarly, the Motorola Text application copies messages from your handset and stores them on the secure Motorola Text server. Those two applications let you add, delete and update your contacts online using your PC keyboard instead of your phone's keypad. You are also able to read and respond to your messages. Motorola Setup is another handy application, which automatically gets the required settings for internet and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the Rough Guides Mobile is a piece of software jointly developed by Creativity Software Ltd, Rough Guides, Motorola and ViaMichelin. It provides travelers with information about points of interest in hundreds of cities across Europe. This application draws on the trusted content of Rough Guides, the acclaimed publisher of travel information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rough Guides Mobile uses a navigable map interface; it takes users from a continent overview to street level detail. Information is available on over 200 cities in 33 European countries, including maps for every single point of interest. The application is available in English, German, Italian, Spanish and French. ViaMichelin is the provider of maps for the Rough Guides Mobile application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service itself is free to Motorola V8 owners, only carrier data charges may apply.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola V8 offers two games - Football and Sudoku. Neither is something to talk much about - the well-known games with standard interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And finally, the final<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No doubt Motorola RAZR2 V8 is a stylish mobile phone, a high-flier in design, adequate in functionality. Motorola faithfuls will hail it, while many other unbiased users are likely to find it agreeable. The Motorola RAZR V3 was near revolutionary back in its day but three years after it was introduced, the glory has started to fade. And the RAZR2 V8 is in for an ordeal living up to its status. The major competitors Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG have a few thin, cool and loaded gadgets to offer. So, keeping the glory alive is truly a challenge. The RAZR2 V8 has what it takes in style and high-class finish but seems to lack some of the current must-have features such as 3G and an autofocus camera. We feel that if Motorola had done just a little bit better they would have had a true winner.</paragraph>
