			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 is quite a rare bird: it packs a full QWERTY keyboard and looks like a BlackBerry handset, but has a completely different line of business. Even if it was designed with teens and tweens in mind, we wouldn't be surprised if their moms fell for it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social networking services are all the rage these days and mobile phone makers have duly noticed that. The LG KS360 was among the first devices of the mobile social networking breed targeted specifically at the younger ones among us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 walks in its shoes and though it isn't unique in terms of design, the idea behind it helps it stand out in the crowd. Teenagers enjoy texting and social networks are just a more elaborate and more integrated way of staying in touch with friends. So, LG are continuously exploring a market, which doesn't exactly brim with competing devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specific form factor of the GW300 makes it look much more promising than it actually is. In fact, it only does what it was meant to do. It gives access to Facebook and has a comfy keyboard for fast typing and that's pretty much your lot. When it comes to the other goodies you may expect from a modern phone - music, camera, etc - you get a pretty limited feature pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of the LG GW300's drawbacks is a real deal breaker since the price is so low no one could've expected anything more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things would've looked better for the GW300 if it came with 3G support and a better camera (2 megapixel fixed focus is a real blast from the past). Wi-Fi would've been an even better cure for the data-thirsty Facebook application, which needs almost constant access to the Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even the single noteworthy application on the GW300 - the Facebook one - is underdeveloped lacking real push support. You have to manually update the Facebook feed instead of getting news the moment they happen. We guess if Push was enabled, the data traffic generated would have scared the life out of the bill payer. And let's face it, that's more than likely going to be a parent of a user rather than the user themselves, so maybe this was a wise decision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, you sometimes have to see things from a different angle before drawing any conclusions. And with that in mind, let's get on with the LG GW300 and see if this is the right phone for you (or for you kid).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GW300 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a full QWERTY bar, the LG GW300 manages to keep its size as friendly as possible. It measures 115.5 x 61 x 12.8 mm, which makes it compact enough to fit in almost every pocket or purse. The phone is all plastic so it weighs only 95 g and feels really light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found that the size and weight are just about perfect for the form factor. The handset feels pretty solid and it handles comfortably.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A full QWERTY keyboard isn't something that you only find in business-oriented devices and this has been the situation for a little while now. If you aren't used to it, then brace yourself because more phones like the GW300 will be coming along in the nearest future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 comes in various color variations - black, blue, red, orange, pink (some of them are market or operator dependant). Regardless of color version, the phone looks really nice (apart from the odd round knobs under the screen, which are surprisingly comfy).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4" 256K-color display of 320 x 240 pixel resolution takes half of the front panel. It's larger than most of its competitors' screens and delivers nice image quality. And luckily, unlike LG's touchscreen equipped devices, the display of the GW300 sports good (though still not excellent) sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a bit overcrowded under the screen of the GW300 with all these 6 buttons plus the round D-pad. The aesthetics of the key design may be questionable, but they are extra thumbable and offer great user experience. We can only complain about the small-sized Call/End buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GW300 has a very friendly four-row QWERTY keypad with excellent touch orientation. The keys look and feel just like those on the Nokia E71. The even backlighting guarantees hassle-free typing in the dark and there is even a dedicated shortcut to the message composer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had no Nokia E71 available at the office during our time with the GW300 but we did manage to shoot some face to face pics with the E72.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left-hand side we find the volume rocker and the microSD card slot. The phone should support up to 4GB cards, however, our unit handled a 16GB microSD card hassle-free. A plastic lid covers the card slot to keep away dirt and grime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side there is only a camera shutter key. It's not really needed as the camera doesn't have auto focus and the D-pad would have been enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port are on top of the device. The microUSB port is used both for data transfers and charging as part of the global LG portfolio shift to the more standardized connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker and the camera lens are easily visible on the back of the device. The 2 megapixel snapper of the GW300 doesn't have a flash but the real big loss is autofocus (along with the low resolution, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover is a breeze - you simply press the dedicated button to eject the cover. Underneath is the 900 mAh Li-Ion battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 is said to offer up to 5 h of talk time and up to 400 h of standby time. In reality, the device stayed up and running for 3 full days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy with the ergonomics of the LG GW300, especially with the QWERTY keyboard. The GW300 looks a bit cheap but its overall build quality is fine. The only cause for complaint is the quiet creaking sound produced by the battery cover.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: LiveSquare comm manager is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GW300 has the latest Flash-based non-touch interface by LG. The interface features a lot of nice animations and transition effects. However, the best part of it is the LiveSquare, which we've already seen in a couple of touchscreen-equipped LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is generally quick and responsive enough. We experienced some serious lags a number of times; however, the culprit turned out to be our full 16GB memory card. Obviously, LG have noticed this as well and that's why they recommend up usage of card up to only 4GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LiveSquare homescreen is one of the few notable improvements over the previous versions of LG's feature phone user interface. The LiveSquare is in essence a log of all your recent communications. They are displayed on the screen in several different layouts. You can set the background as a Zoo or a Park, populated by small human or animal figures notifying you of missed events or received calls and messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of messages (or other events like incoming calls and emails) is displayed in a small bubble next to each figure. You even get such figures for events from contacts not in your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set the LiveSquare to reset every day so you'll see only today's communications. Using the grey button in the bottom left corner you can access a complete communication history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu system is simple, yet decently organized and generally very usable. The main menu consists of a 3 x 4 grid of icons or a list depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GW300 comes equipped with a task manager allowing you to run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on the GW300 has a dedicated "launcher" knob on the keyboard placed next to the Call key.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG GW300 is up to 1000 contacts, each with its full set of details. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a personal picture (including a character for the LiveSquare) and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of available fields for each contact on your list - you start off with fourteen fields, but once you enter a number or an email address, an additional field of the same type becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add a note to a contact. When you enter the birthday field, you can also have the phone save the date to the calendar as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't want to go through all the contacts to reach those starting with "Z" for example, you use the search box at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for displaying the SIM and phone contacts separately, as well as all together in a single list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 handles phone calls trouble-free, no voice quality or reception issues.There is Smart Dialing, and Speed dial is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Smart Dial is quite useless as it only searches for contacts whose numbers contain the digits you typed. That's not of much use since most people don't bother to remember the numbers of their contacts as long as they know their names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 scored an Excellent mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is FUNtastic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 handles SMS, MMS, and email. Much like most other handsets by LG, SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the comfortable QWERTY keyboard texting is a real pleasure. Even if your fingers are on the bigger side it won't be such a problem for you to get used to the GW300's keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG GW300 deals with them hassle-free. Setting up an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever setup. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically. Furthermore, we were prompted to select between POP and IMAP setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported. You can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum outgoing and incoming mail size is set to 1MB. Still, such limitations are a nuisance in a modern email client and we suspect they're imposed to save network carriers the traffic hassle and to keep customers' bills low enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but still you can save those to the phone memory when you receive them. The same goes for MS Office and PDF files, but unfortunately you cannot preview those on the GW300 as it was possible on most other LG phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes the main highlight of the LG GW300 - the Facebook Java app, which can also be left to run in the background. It doesn't support push so you need to update your Facebook wall constantly to check for new content. As you can see, the application is actually quite usable and the only thing you have no access to are the games. But you can at least keep in touch with your friends, view images, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GW300 gallery is accessed through the file manager (a.k.a. "My stuff") or the camera (by tapping on Album). Up to 8 images are displayed at a time: 2 rows with 4 thumbnails each. If you use a memory card of larger capacity, you may need to wait a little for the gallery to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view images in landscape mode only. Zooming on an image is quick and smooth but the reason for that is the preset maximum file size limit (in other words: it's not that the phone is that zippy, it's just that the images are not that large).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic music player, cool sound<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 has a basic but practical music player. With the LG GW300 music player you can filter tracks as with any other modern music player - by artist, album, genre, and recently played. User-created playlists are also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player can run in the background but you are unable to control it while minimized (you have to use the task manager instead and to go back to the music player).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several non-customizable equalizers presets on board. However, we noticed that almost all of them cause serious distortion so our favorite setting turned out to be the "No style".</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>RDS-less FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 comes with an FM radio and you can enjoy it on either earphones or on the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and much like the music player, you can minimize it. To get back to the FM radio you use the task manager.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor 2 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. There's no flash or auto focus, but given the low price of the handset we aren't that surprised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is more of a complementary feature on the social networking oriented GW300, as it was in the GW520 other devices of that kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera settings are quite a lot for this kind of shooter. They include white balance, three quality levels going from basic to high, timer, and various effects. Sequence shots are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few things likely to disappoint - there is no cover to protect the lens from scratches, the lack of a flash rules out night portraits, while the fixed focus is sure to ruin any attempt at a close-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, there is a dedicated shutter button which quite naturally is used not only for shooting but also for starting the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is not the best as the image noise levels are quite high and there are traces of oversharpening, however the results are similar to the ones achieved by the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GW300 camera captures only QCIF resolution video clips. While they can be unlimited in length, their quality and resolution is only good for an occasional MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stone age web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300's web browser is among its weakest points. We couldn't even open our web page - all we got is a message telling us there's not enough memory. The only way we succeeded was in text-only mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the guys from LG should take a better look at the calendar. The year is 2010 already and modern phone browsers are supposed to have no problems working with HTML content (that includes the embedded images, of course). WAP sites are a thing of the past!</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If we have to describe the LG GW300 with only a few words, then maybe we'd start with that: what you see is what you get - no more, no less. This is just an affordable texting handset with access to Facebook. Yes, it also packs some other features but all of them are cut down one way or another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a camera, but it is only capable of taking low-resolution images and MMS-fit videos. You also get a web browser but it's actually unusable. The only extra feature that we were pleased with is the music player, which is accompanied by a nice user interface, stereo Bluetooth and, most importantly, a standard 3.5mm audio jack. However, the phone lacks some substantial connectivity goodies such as Wi-Fi and 3G support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, it does very well where it's supposed to. Its QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable and we've been enjoying texting on it since day one. And when it comes to Facebook, it's been integrated in a great way. The Facebook app isn't just a link to the site but is actually a fun and useful application allowing access to your account as well as the ones of your friends. And browsing image galleries works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when it comes to the competition, there are only a few other devices of that kind. The only direct GW300 competitor is the Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT which feels like a GW300 clone. Save for the exchangeable back covers, the rest is almost the same. Well, almost - the B3210 CorbyTXT display is of lower resolution and the battery of lower capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more devices sharing GW300's form factor and price range, namely the Nokia E63 and perhaps the BlackBerry Curve 8520. Both sport Wi-Fi and the E63 even comes with 3G support. But what is even more important, both handsets are smartphones and cost only a bit more than the GW300.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E63 ? BlackBerry Curve 8520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to affordable messaging devices, there are few more names that we can think of. Of course, we mean handsets that have a slide-out QWERTY keyboard such as the LG GW520, the Nokia 6760 slide, the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO or the Samsung B3410. The main difference between them and the LG GW300 is actually their greatest selling point; namely, the keyboard which - thanks to the form factor - tends to be more spacious (read: more comfy).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG GW520 ? Nokia 6760 slide ? Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO ? Samsung B3410</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW300 is limited in many ways, but it does the job it was made for. So if you can live with the flaws we've mentioned and the price suits you, then perhaps all that's left is choosing the paintjob.</paragraph>
