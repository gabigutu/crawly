			<paragraph>Inspiration is one thing you can't deny the Samsung Soul lineup. Well, that goes to the Ultra too, though all of them thin and sexy handsets are pretty much doomed to oblivion by their own offspring. Back in the day, we said the original U900 Soul was to crown the Ultra lineup. OK, we take it back; it has started a dynasty of its own. The bloodline grows stronger and spreads over different form factors. The latest Soul handset has a b index appended to its name, but any B-list connotations seem out of place here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The obvious shortfall is in the imaging department: Soul b is the only handset in the lineup to miss a 5-megapixel shooter. As for the rest, the pedigree is there. The ultra thin but solid brushed metal bar goes beyond looks and style. Samsung U800 Soul b boasts 3.6 Mbps HSDPA, a 16M-color QVGA display, 3 MP camera with LED flash and 1GB of microSD-expandable onboard memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a Soul slider (Samsung U900 Soul) and a flip (Samsung G400) already there, the new Soul b bar makes sure the Spirit of Ultra lineup sets foot on all form factors. All it takes is some sick imagination and no one can stop you dreaming of a Soul handset with a full QWERTY keyboard. By the way, the Samsung U900 Soul is quietly aging in our review database (in case you've missed it here's the link), while the G400 review is in the making. So, stay tuned for our full scoop there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite obviously, Samsung U800 Soul b is taking on Nokia 6500 classic. The key differences are 3G speed, memory expansion and the megapixel count. All those are in favor of the Soul b, but boy, it's a tough call with these two lookers. The thin walkman Sony Ericsson W890 might be another option to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess that you should be interested enough to hit the small jump for our big review of the Samsung U800 Soul b.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U800 Soul b 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even if 9.9 mm is no stunning thin any more, Samsung U800 Soul b is quite a looker. Clean lines and brushed metal exterior, the Soul b is subtly captivating. It has some of that classic solidity to make you feel there's more to it than sleek exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There should be 5 different color version of the Soul b - namely Soul Grey, Platinum Silver, Metallic Black, Soul Pink and Amethyst Violet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3G enabled Soul b flaunts a video-call camera in the top right corner of the front. The earpiece is alongside, dead center. The 2" screen gets the 16M-color treatment to follow the trend of the original Soul. More on it is coming up later in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the ample and comfortable D-pad, which is in charge of navigation. On its sides are the two soft keys, along with the Call and End knobs. The End key is also used for turning the handset on and off, as there is no dedicated key for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Samsung U800 Soul b keeps the same design and styling as the U900 Soul to prove that you don't change things that work. Of course, some changes were inevitable. The Soul b keypad doesn't have the dedicated video-call key and the Application Switch key. A C key is nowhere in sight either. The alphanumeric keypad uses really large keys with stylish ridges between rows to ensure great touch orientation. The backlighting is even and strong to to makes things even sweeter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of Samsung U800 we find the volume rocker and the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated camera key and the USB port are on the opposite side of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the handset are completely bereft of controls. The lanyard eyelet is the only thing to spot at the bottom part of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3 megapixel camera lens is at the top of the rear along with the LED flash, placed within a slightly elevated metallic frame. Next to the camera module is the loudspeaker grill. All the way down the bottom is the battery cover latch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got to be noted that we had some issues with the battery cover latch. In our beta unit it's got a clear construction fault. The release button sticks out so when you place the handset on its back on a hard surface it releases the battery cover by itself. It's highly likely that this will be fixed in the retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals a Li-Ion battery of unknown capacity. It's quite likely for the Soul b to use the same 880 mAh unit found in the first Soul. We did have our doubts about its adequacy back then but we were pleasantly surprised with the Soul b going for about 4 days of medium usage on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap up inspecting the phone's hardware, we have to say that we are generally very pleased with build quality and delighted with looks. The brushed metallic exterior is quite a show-off. Plus, the handset manages an exceptionally pleasant feel in hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U800 Soul is equipped with a 2" 16M color TFT LCD display of QVGA resolution. We've been there already with the U900 Soul. The display has great image quality and brightness, but obviously struggles under direct sunlight. As a matter of fact, this is the case with almost all recent Samsung handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making phone calls with Samsung U800 Soul b is an enjoyable experience. Voice quality is never an issue on either end of a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung, as you always have some sort of dialing animation, or a choice of several ones. In the case of Samsung U800 Soul b you have as many as six of them: Quill pen, Sticky note, two named "Normal", Living world and Theme. The last two vary a little according to the theme or your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Dialing assists dialing greatly - you no longer have to open your phonebook. Once you start typing in numbers it searches your phonebook for contacts whose names or numbers contain characters corresponding to the keys you've pressed on the alphanumeric keypad. The Samsung U800 Soul b also automatically looks up contacts, whose numbers contain the typed digits. The two types of search provide really quick access to any contact in your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did our traditional speakerphone test with the Samsung U800 Soul b. Here is how it ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured recently. It's an average performer, ranking just about the middle of the table. You can find more info on the test itself and the other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: U900 Soul clone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of Samsung U800 Soul b is a slightly improved version of what we saw in the Ultra II line of handsets. It brings greater customization and some minor novelties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu structure of U800 Soul b is typical Samsung. There are nice graphical transitions between screens here as well but we miss the speed and responsiveness of the first Samsung U900 Soul. Processing speed or else, this is one nasty step back from the first Soul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessible from the stand-by display by pressing the center key of the large D-pad and it opens after a sizeable lag. You can also use the left soft key for that purpose if you prefer. The right soft key is reserved for the phonebook. The four directions of the touchpad have shortcuts of their own and these can be changed to best suit the user. Samsung U800 Soul b also has the animated background with analogue clock we came to know since the first Ultra lineup. The feature sets a certain landmark as your wallpaper according to the country where the phone is being used. It's nice feature, but it's pretty dull if you hardly leave your country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also another option for the wallpaper - you can select a number of photos that can run in slide show on the homescreen. The transition effect is configurable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as either a 4 x 3 grid of icons or a standard list. The much contested feature of all recent Samsung phones, where the last used items and sub-items are highlighted by default when you open a submenu is also present here. We like it this way and it proves useful when you use a given feature more than once - for example trying out different themes, varying a setting, starting the music player or Bluetooth, or whatever.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U800 Soul b surely won't get users bored. It offers a great number of customization options. The three preinstalled themes are all very nice and we happened to particularly enjoy the one named Monolithic Purity. It perfectly blends with the brushed metal design and benefits the phone looks greatly. You can also create your own theme, tuning every single element to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third available theme, called Samsung Theme, takes after the main menu of Samsung F480, a phone we reviewed in detail a couple of months ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing we are missing in the Themes customization section is the three different font sizes for the user interface. These were greatly appreciated in Samsung U600 and it is a pity they are not available here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of U800 Soul b is typical Samsung again. Up to 1000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It displays the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name. You can also use the Smart Dialing feature we mentioned earlier. Unluckily, Samsung U800 Soul b - much like Samsung U900 Soul and U600 - searches only in the contact's first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 2 email addresses and URLs, and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and a picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's image" - a feature that is now becoming pretty common.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized into groups, which can then have their own ringtones and pictures. There is also a birthday field, which can be set as a calendar event with only a few clicks. This is quite a convenient solution. Contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth. You can also save namecards to your memory card if you want to transfer them that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call logging department has also been slightly improved in comparison to the previous Samsung U-models. Both the Call key in stand-by and the call log icon from the menu give you access to the application. It has four tabs - recent contacts, dialed numbers, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those tabs used to be somewhat inconveniently separated but with Samsung U800 Soul b this is no longer a problem. From the Call log, user can add separate numbers to a reject list. When there is incoming call from a blocked number, it is displayed in the call log as usual without any indication of it being blocked. The unwanted caller will hear one "free" signal and the call will be dropped right after.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are also data and call time counters and even a call cost feature if you provide information about your subscription plan.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: nice keypad, nice job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U800 Soul b handles all common types of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and emails. The first three share the same editor. You can covert your SMS to EMS by simply applying formatting or to MMS by inserting an image or other multimedia content. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. In case message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so you can try resending it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for 500 SMS, 30 push messages, 200 broadcast messages and 30 configuration messages in the phone's memory. As far as emails and MMS are concerned, they are not limited in number and storage depends on the available memory only. There is 1GB available for these, which should be enough on most occasions. Incoming messages can also be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very good. It can manage up to five accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval (options vary from 30 minutes to 1 day).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Soul b file browser lists all the folders from both the phone memory and the memory card together. There are folders for different file types - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. However, if you misplace some file the handset will still handle it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser functionality is one of the best among non-smartphones. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (save for the root ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one or multiple at once. Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion. The downside we used to find in some of the older Samsung handsets - the really slow memory card reading - is pestering the Samsung U800 too. That's another downside compared to the first Soul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested two microSDHC memory cards with U800 Soul b - a 4GB one and an 8GB one. Both cards were recognized by the handset and it had no problems with them except for the lengthy initial recognition time. Both memory cards were full of music files and photos. It turned out that the Soul b needs 2:15min in order to initially recognize the 4GB card, which was loaded with 2170 files in 470 folders. The same exercise with the 8GB card with 3360 files in 513 folders took 5:10min - which honestly is quite a wait, but it's a one-time job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening a folder that contains images. You can now copy or move images to any folder of your liking, unlike the previous Samsung handset where only the Images folder was available for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures are displayed as a list with a small thumbnail next to each filename. Sorting can be done by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view a picture in portrait mode only, unless you apply the fullscreen view mode, which switches the gallery to landscape. You can also zoom in on a picture to see greater detail though we must warn you that zooming in and out is annoyingly slow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image editing in full shine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's one of the most capable image editing applications for mobile phones. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items, are also available. All in all, the Samsung U800 Soul b offers you virtually all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. We still doubt it anyone takes image editing on their mobiles seriously. But it should come in handy for resizing some photos in order to send them by email.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with 1GB of internal memory and a microSD card slot, the Samsung U800 Soul b has every premise to act as a portable music player. It is therefore important that the music player application be up to the task. Not that it's that hard of a task but still sometimes it's the small things that mess up the big picture. Luckily this is not the case with the U800 Soul b.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player application allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre and composers. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. The player in Samsung U800 has undergone some changes when compared to, say, Samsung U600 but the functionality isn't greatly altered. It has no equalizer presets, but sound effects instead. The difference is that the sound effects also include wide and surround options in addition to the seven available presets. There are also three types of visualization and you can enable fading out on stop if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U800 Soul b comes complete with an FM radio, which is doing quite well in terms of user interface. It has the self-tune option to store all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS that can be switched on and off depending on your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn't have many features but all the essentials are covered - it can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U800 Soul b is more than adequate in terms of audio quality. We are pleased with most of the values, except the total harmonic distortion and inter modulation distortion where the values deviate significantly. We are aware that these results might be due to the beta version of the U800 we're reviewing and hope that the problems will be fixed before the handset hits the shelves. Samsung have an outstanding playback quality record ith their previous phones and it would be a shame if they don't stand up to the bar they've set for themselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No autofocus, but still an excellent camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U800 Soul b is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera with maximum image resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. The camera interface very much resembles that of Samsung G800 with its rich settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more important settings are picture size, shooting mode (single shot, multi-shot, mosaic, and frame), effects (black and white, sepia, negative etc.), and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Samsung U800 Soul b is very good. We especially appreciated the image processing, which strikes an excellent balance of in-camera sharpening, noise levels and scene detail to produce commendable results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real downer is there is no auto focus to assist close ups, so those are impossible. Nevertheless, we are really satisfied with what the U800 Soul b offers in terms of image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some Samsung U800 Soul b sample camera photos:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recoding is concerned, Samsung U800 Soul b is a downright disappointment. Yes, there's good enough reasons for the Soul b bar to lose ground to the U900 Soul slider in many departments, but the QCIF video recording at 15 fps is? well? too hard to swallow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung U80 Soul b you can count on 3G with HSDPA support and GPRS/EDGE for browsing internet on the go. The 7.2 Mbps HSDPA is obviously off the reach of the Soul bar. Not that such speed is actually achievable but maybe in the years to come this will change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the network connectivity options, the Soul b also supports USB and Bluetooth, both version 2.0. There is also A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone works seamlessly when transferring data to and from PC. A notable enhancement to the Bluetooth File Browser service is the ability to make certain files or folders visible or invisible according to your needs. The USB connection has PC Studio, Media player and Mass storage modes. Each of them can be set as default or otherwise the user will be prompted for action upon connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser needs improvement<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Web browser of Samsung U800 Soul b leaves somewhat mixed impressions. We were glad to see a NetFront 3.4 web browser used, as we know what it is capable of. It turned out though its capabilities were seriously trimmed down in the U800 Soul b. There is no landscape view mode and the page resize feature doesn't work that well. When reducing the size, the font isn't handled properly and any text on the screen becomes compressed to being downright illegible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also no trace of the mouse pointer we've been seeing in some of the recent Samsung and Sony Ericsson handsets, that use the same version of the NetFront web browser. On the positive side, pages are rendered well in both desktop and Smart-fit view mode. However, as mentioned, this only holds true if you are using the default page size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar of Samsung U800 Soul b offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available for setting up: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important and private. Each of those has its own unique fields and an alarm to remind of. The Calendar can store up to 100 appointments, 50 anniversaries, 50 holidays, 20 important and 20 private events. Much like with previous Samsung handsets, you can choose which calendar view should be default and pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots on Samsung U800 Soul b. Each of them can have its own snooze time, number of repetitions and activation days. The volume can also be different for each alarm and all but one of them can be renamed to the user's liking. The Wake-up alarm name cannot be altered. Furthermore, you can set different tones for each of the alarms and you can choose whether it should trigger phone vibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world clock application, a calculator, and a unit convertor. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will probably be of use to sports-minded users. There is also a handy to-do manager that can help you organize your time better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final application worth mentioning in Samsung U800 Soul b is the integrated document viewer. It supports viewing MS Word, MS Excel and PDF files and handles them well. However, the application is so slow it ruins the whole experience. Both scrolling and zooming on documents does take ages and we find that quite annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U800 Soul b is a nice try to diversify the supply in the Soul lineup. It has a sleek form factor and lacks any serious disadvantages if you don't count the somewhat slow interface response and the annoying battery release mechanism that seems to engage by itself once you set the handset on a hard surface. You should bear in mind that we are reviewing a beta unit here and those things might still be updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving that aside, the Samsung U800 Soul b certainly manages to deliver on all fronts - it's got an excellent outfit, a really good 3 megapixel camera and plenty of storage space. Some might argue that it comes a little too late as the similarly equipped Nokia 6500 classic and Sony Ericsson W890 have been around for a while and their street prices are much more reasonable now. But given a right price tag, the Soul b will earn its place under the sun and in the hearts of style conscious fans. It's an excellent package and would surely liven up things in its segment.</paragraph>
