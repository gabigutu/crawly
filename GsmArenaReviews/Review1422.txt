			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Though it might seem like a chicken-and-egg situation, the question in our case never was which one came first: Windows Phone 7 or the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7. We know you?re all adding two and two together. Our Windows Phone 7 review was based on this Samsung Omnia 7 here. You can?t blame the OS for taking unfair advantage but you can?t deny the fact either that a Super AMOLED screen can make anything look good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that we?re saying that Windows Phone 7 is just anything. And of course, it just can?t and won?t be anything you want it to be. But that?s not the whole story. Let?s just say Microsoft are in charge of the numerology and leaving it to manufacturers to do the math.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it?s simple but expensive math. WVGA screens, 1 GHz processors and dedicated GPUs are the minimum requirements for any set to run the brand new OS. Let?s just repeat that ? those are the MINIMUM requirements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No wonder then, the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 has no choice but to be the Galaxy S of the new Windows phones. It has the same 4 inches of a gorgeous Super AMOLED screen, a 1GHz Snapdragon powerplant and it captures 5 megapixel photos and records HD videos. If there was one thing to hold against the I9000 Galaxy S it had to be the plastic finish. But Samsung listened to their customers and gave the Omnia 7 the same get-up as the first Bada phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Omnia 7 seems to have it all to make a grand entrance ? premium build, powerful hardware and a brand new OS are all thrown into the mix. We can hardly think of any weak spots on the chassis.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WP7-specific limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s no big secret Microsoft wants to sell Windows Phone 7 big time. The easiest route to success is to set out the blueprint and leave the rest to the manufacturers. It might even seem life in Redmond is easy and the makers are meeting a real challenge. To develop a phone that not only meets Microsoft?s strict requirements as a high-performance carrying vessel for the new OS, but one that also has its own spirit and identity. Samsung seem quite up to the task so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re eyeing Microsoft's latest and greatest as a possible purchase, you?ll surely go through the pros and cons of the Omnia 7 carefully. Samsung is guilty of committing only a couple of them, while the rest are all Microsoft?s fault. But in the end, they will all be held against the phone in equal measure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As many of our readers have already commented under our Windows Phone 7 OS review, the new OS is quite similar to Apple?s iOS in its strange limitations ? stuff such as lack of a USB mass storage mode or no copy/paste, or even the lack of a memory card support ? those are all quite inexplicable to the regular user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft went the same way with the synchronization ? you?ll need the latest Zune software (minimum ver. 4.7) and that?s the only way to access your phone ? photos, music, videos and applications ? all goes through Zune. Sounds familiar, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Windows Phone 7 is designed as a premium OS and Microsoft has obviously managed to convince most major manufacturers to accept the strict hardware requirements. And despite the silly-looking limitations, it looks they may be all on to something great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s not waste any more time in introductions and go straight to the Omnia 7 hardware basics ? right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 122 x 64.3 x 11 mm, the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 is a big phone, yet you wouldn?t call it a monster. About the size of the Galaxy S, the Omnia 7 is just the right bit more powerful and assertive. In a nut shell, it?s a slim and solid handset with neat economic styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone weighs in at 138 g ? the same category as the iPhone 4. We guess, most of the load is attributed to the metal rear. The phone feels secure enough to handle and navigate, and looks quite durable too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The I8700 Omnia 7 has much of the Samsung S8500 Wave design DNA in it. On the face of it though, it?s the most unusual of recent Samsung phones we?ve seen lately. We know it borders on blasphemy but the Omnia 7 looks more like an HTC phone than a typical Samsung set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Losing the uniform, curvy Samsung look is in a way a good thing. It wouldn?t have made much sense for a brand new Windows Phone 7 device to be anonymous in a crowd of Corbies, Waves and Galaxies. The important thing anyway is the Omnia 7 feels and looks great. It?s elegant, solid and professional as well as being nicely resistant to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display are the only three keys on the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7?s front panel. The capacitive Back and Search buttons are either side of a hardware Start key (Windows logo). The touch controls are haptic enabled, while the round Start knob is pretty much the same as the iPhone?s main control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece, the proximity and the ambient light sensors. The Samsung Omnia 7 doesn?t feature a secondary video-call camera. In fact video telephony is a no-go on any Windows Phone 7 for the time being.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 hosts the volume rocker which, however thin, is prominent enough and very comfortable to use. The lanyard eyelet is also here ? in the top left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right we only find the camera key and the lock button. Both are pretty tiny knobs but properly raised and tactile. The shutter key is soft and responsive, with a distinct half-press. The camera launches almost instantly when you press the key ? even when the phone is locked. Thanks to the input of the proximity sensor, the camera won?t start that way when the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the microUSB port, hiding under a neat plastic lid that slides softly in and out. The uncovered 3.5mm audio jack is also there. At the bare bottom you?ll only see a mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 rear hosts the unprotected 5-megapixel camera lens, a LED flash and the loudspeaker. The handset?s rear is almost identical to the Samsung S8500 Wave?s ? the brushed aluminum finish is pleasant to the touch and quite good looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum battery cover gets released by pressing a small knob at the bottom. Underneath is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the battery we find the SIM compartment. Windows Phone 7 does support memory cards (in a strange and limited way), but there is no memory slot on the Omnia 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you liked the Samsung Wave, you?ll just love the Omnia 7. It?s an impressively well built, slim and solid device. It doesn?t look like just another Samsung phone either ? it?s carrying a brand new OS and is eager to make a point. We have no complaints with the controls or handling. And it certainly goes without saying that Super AMOLED technology makes for a killer display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Four inches of Super AMOLED<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardly a surprise, the front of the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 is dominated by the touchscreen: a 4? unit of WVGA resolution. The Omnia 7 is equipped with a Super AMOLED screen, which is exactly the same as the one on the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED display technology has quite an edge over LCD in terms of contrast and that?s hardly news. Super AMOLED screens have the deepest blacks we?ve seen on a mobile phone. The remarkable color vibrancy makes the Omnia 7 display image quality all the more impressive. The viewing angles are the best in the business and outdoor visibility is top notch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default Windows Phone 7 uses black and white backgrounds and text. Thanks to the Super AMOLED screen, some of those white fonts on black look almost surreal ? like printed on a piece of high-quality gloss paper rather than appearing on a digital display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface with Live tiles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We reviewed Windows Phone 7 just recently so, if you?re curious about the OS rather than a specific phone, you should check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, October 7, 2011: The Windows Phone 7.5 update is out and it brings new functionality and resolves some of the issues that we've mentioned in this review. Check out our Windows Phone 7.5 review here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The following software part of Windows Phone 7 reviews feels like a book you?ve read ? that?s because all WP7 phones run the exact same software, with just a couple of preinstalled apps that make some difference. So don?t get surprised that we?ve reused some texts along the way. We want you to be sure that even when we reuse portions of the texts, we always take care to check our facts with the review unit thoroughly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you notice in the Omnia 7 is that the Today screen is gone ? and good riddance we say as the new homescreen is one of the most flexible homescreens we?ve seen. You?ll notice just how many useful things you can put on it as this review goes on. The iconic Start menu is gone too (and no more honeycombs either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first things first ? in the WP7 review we talked about the excellent aesthetics of the new OS, but looking at it from the brilliant screen of the Omnia 7, it looks all the more appealing. Sure, most of it is black, but you can easily change the color combos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For us switching to a lighted background took away from the experience. And if you?re not a fan of blue, there are plenty of other foreground colors to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue, we should make sure you understand one thing. Beauty is subjective but the Metro UI of the Windows Phone 7 is a real beauty. Despite the lack of shadows and 3D volume to the UI elements, the interface is in no way dull. You really have to see the videos in order to appreciate the smoothness, graphics and animations provided by the design team.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Metro UI has two main parts that live side by side ? the homescreen (referred to as ?Start?) and the main menu. You can switch between the two by sideways swipes or using the arrow button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is a square grid of Live tiles. Live tiles fit the broad concept of ?widget? but, unlike most widgets out there, they are very uniform with clear labels that indicate what each one of them does. They also show some quick info (e.g. number of messages, the date) but they are also the Windows Phone 7 equivalent of homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a traditional list ? this is where all the hubs and installed apps are listed. A press and hold reveals a context menu, which lets you ?pin? items to the homescreen (that is put their Live tile there) along with uninstall and also rate and review the app (if it?s an installed app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no folders in the main menu ? so the more apps you install, the longer the list will get. This could make finding rarely used apps quite a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quite simple ? sideways swipes navigate a sort of tabbed interface and there are on-screen soft keys. This will covers the most commonly used features, but for advanced features you can tap the ?...? symbol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It opens an extended context menu (and also reveals a label under each soft key, if the icon wasn?t descriptive enough). A press and hold on an item will reveal a menu to manipulate just one item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Windows Phone 7 has lost since the 6th iteration is multitasking. It handles a lot like a pre ver-4 iOS. The Start key (the one with the Windows logo) gets out of the app and brings up the homescreen. Alternatively, you can exit an app using the Back key. That gets you back to the app last used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That last app will continue from exactly the same point from where you left it. Getting back into an app is done by tapping its live tile or shortcut in the menu or by using the back button, which returns to the previous screen (even if it was from a completely different app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no ?recently used? type of list to make going back to the app you need easier ? so you might have to search for it in the main menu or keep hitting back until you see it. So, no multitasking is not a complete loss, but not quite as comfortable as true multitasking OSes either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo of the UI in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is very social ? there are no references to ?contacts? or ?contact?s details?, instead it refers to your friends and colleagues as ?people? and their ?profile?. Profile is a term right out of the social networking playbook, which is a good indication of what?s ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with blue squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can include or exclude Facebook friends and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the ?What?s new? panel?, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good, but no smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The signal reception with the Samsung Omnia 7 was strong even in areas with known poor reception. We didn?t experience dropped calls and the in-call sound was clear, though not as loud as we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video calls are no-go though ? at least not using the 3G video call standard. You?d need a dedicated app to do that and there aren?t any just yet (this should change very soon though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alternative is voice dialing - the phone usually recognized our commands, but it might stumble when it comes to telling different contacts with the same name apart (e.g. with "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan" in the phone book, "Call Dexter Morgan" often results in calling "Dexter" instead).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear at full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Samsung Omnia 7 fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. Bear in mind that though it didn't score high, its sound is really smooth and nice to listen to, so the number don't tell the whole picture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging expert<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Windows Phone 7 uses threaded view to organize your messages. When you start the app, you?ll see a list of conversations ? each conversation consists of multiple messages visualized as speech bubbles, which are ordered by the time they were sent/received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An empty speech bubble will hang at the bottom waiting for you to type a response. A message can have multiple recipients too by using the + button next to the recipient field. Just the first few letters of the contact?s name are needed ? the search feature will find it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can attach a photo to turn the message into an MMS ? either an existing photo or you can snap a new one. You can add only one though and you can only attach photos (not videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email app is pretty good. It easily found the settings for our Gmail and Hotmail test accounts. Each inbox is separate and you can pin it to the homescreen. There?s no aggregated inbox view however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to display all, unread or flagged messages ? by sweeps to the side and you can browse all folders for the email account and batch operations are easy ? a tap on the left side of the screen selects the message, so you can move it, mark it as (un)read or flag it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each message can be flagged, which is a great way to pick out only the emails that are important right now ? just tap the ?toggle flag? option from the context menu when you?re done with them and they are off the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried emailing a photo from Omnia 7's camera, but the email app downscaled it before sending - so, emailing full resolution shots is no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is a traditional virtual QWERTY with not too many surprises. It can suggest words as you type and correct spelling and also auto-capitalize letters after a full stop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia 7 has got a large, responsive screen and the typing experience is very good. There?s a landscape mode for the keyboard too, which makes it even easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery on an amazing screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub is the photo gallery of Windows Phone 7. When you start it, it shows the most recent photos (including those from the camera), What?s new (which shows photos from online services) and a menu, which lets you view all photos, photos sorted by date and the favorite photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an individual photo supports pinch zooming and you can easily upload the photo to Facebook or share it on some other service. And as with the Samsung Galaxy S, the SuperAMOLED screen makes photos really pop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve had no issues with speed ? Microsoft?s minim spec requirement guarantees that even 5MP photos are handled without a snag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, Microsoft has decided to downscale photos when they are transferred from a computer to the phone using the Zune software (much like emailing a photo).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music and video players are simple and have straightforward interfaces. You won?t have any difficulties using them. However there are some things missing ? like equalizers. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The players can of course work in the background with a nice shortcut ? when you press a volume key, the name of the currently playing track also appears along with play/pause, next and previous buttons (they can also scrub through the song).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the Omnia 7, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer configuration).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo of the Pictures and the Music&amp;Videos hubs:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia 7 also has a built in FM radio with a dead simple interface. You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. There are some limitations though ? we didn?t see RDS or an option to play the sound through the headphones (their cord serves as an antenna) ? the sound always comes out of the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is quiet but clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 did well in our traditional audio quality test. It's among the quietest handsets we have seen but it makes up for that with nicely clean output with audio tracks sounding just the way they were meant to. When attached to an active external amplifier (i.e. your car stereo or your home audio system) the device is doing an impressive job with the cut-off extreme bass frequencies the only thing to frown at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play, the Omnia 7 remained a pretty solid performer and the worsened stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortions are the only things that changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the detailed results:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is great 5MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia 7 has a 5MP autofocus camera and maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. It is accompanied by an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We rarely get surprised by camera UI but Microsoft has managed to pull out another nice UI stunt here as well. A side slide to the right opens the last picture shot and a slide on to the right brings back the camera's live view instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video of the whole thing so you can see what it's like:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings include everything from flash and auto-focus modes, to image settings (contrast, white balance, etc.), effects, shake reduction, Wide Dynamic Range and other options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. But that feature cleverly doesn?t trigger if there?s something in front of the proximity sensor ? like the insides of your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is geo-tagging ? we?ve seen geo-tagging before, but Omnia 7 has the option to strip that information before uploading the photo to an online service. That way, photos in your personal collection can be geo-tagged without worrying that anyone on the Internet can see your home address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Samsung Omnia 7 is pretty impressive for the 5MP range. There?s some noise, but no color noise and the noise reduction algorithms find a good balance between preserving details and removing noise. Even foliage comes out OK.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro shots were really impressive ? the Omnia 7 managed to focus from up close and the amount of captured detail is amazing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped some comparative shots with the Samsung Galaxy S. Here are the results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can record in two resolutions ? VGA or 720p. There is no option to record at a lower resolution for, say, an MMS. Not that we found an option to add a video to MMS though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p video was less impressive in practice than it is on paper. Videos are recorded in .MP4 file format but the bitrate doesn?t seem enough. The amount of captured detail is not stellar and there are easily noticeable compression artifacts (or possibly upscaling artifacts). The frame rate hovers around 23 frames per second, tough it drops when there?s heavier motion in the scene, which results in some choppiness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also noticed that in the beginning of each video, the autofocus would spend a second or two hunting back and forth for the correct focus point, resulting in short moments of blurriness at the beginning of videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's one Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 video sample, untouched by YouTube compression: 720p@25fps</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is frustratingly limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung recently have a good track record with connectivity and they didn?t disappoint. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE are a given, but there?s dual-band 3G with HSDPA and HSUPA too. Wi-Fi b/g/n is supported, which makes the Omnia 7 compatible with a wide range of Wi-Fi networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is ?just? v2.1 (we were expecting v3.0) but other than that wireless connectivity is well supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transferring files between a computer and a Windows Phone 7 mobile could be a problem. Microsoft?s decision to cut out mass storage functionality mean that you need the Zune app on your computer to easily transfer files (the odd way that WP7 handles memory cards wouldn't have helped either, even if the Omnia 7 had a card slot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows syncing over USB or Wi-Fi and this is the only option to transfer files directly from your phone to your computer. Or you can use SkyDrive to transfer files ? a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB free cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is great, save for lack of Flash and Silverlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer in all its incarnations has caught a lot of flack for being clumsy and outdated. But the new version is great and, like Internet Explorer 9 on the desktop, it will change the way people think of IE. It?s not all perfect but most people will use it without missing a thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is perfect and fast, as are panning and scrolling. For zoom, you have double tap and pinch zoom. As an extra guide for navigation there?s the Find on page option. Flipping the phone in landscape orientation clears the onscreen controls and gives the whole screen to the webpage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple tabs are supported and the browser didn?t break a sweat juggling several of them. This is of course thanks to the high hardware specs ? which are guaranteed for each Windows Phone 7 device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>History and favorites are supported and you can even pin a favorite site to the homescreen. Another handy option is to let Bing suggest sites as you type in the URL and Internet Explorer will also suggest sites from the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some things missing though ? Flash is one, but we were at least hoping for Silverlight, which didn?t work either. Saving files is problematic too ? you can only save files that the OS can handle. Text reflow is another feature we missed ? if you zoom in as close as possible to get some fonts readable, you?ll have to pan left and right to read the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Samsung Omnia 7?s screen is among the biggest on a mobile phone and with a high enough resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re curious to see if and when alternative browsers will appear in the Marketplace ? Opera Mini is always welcome and maybe something with Flash would be nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the latest mobile Internet Explorer in action:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is all about your agenda<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar prefers two view modes ? agenda and day view. You have month view too, but you can?t access it by side-swiping ? you need to use the soft key for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two softkeys are Today (brings you to the current date) and Add an appointment. That?s the only type of event you get, but it has enough options to suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple calendars, including our Google Calendar but we had to add it as an Outlook (ActiveSync) account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set multiple alarms ? each with its own name, ringing sound and repeat pattern. We gave up after adding 10 alarms, but the Omnia 7 can take even more. There?s a basic calculator too, which has big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia 7 didn?t come with a unit convertor but we installed a free one from the Marketplace and it worked great. It meshed well with the rest of the interface and was simple to use but quite proficient in conversions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Best office suite yet, but it?s lacking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Office hub is an important part of the Windows Phone 7 package. The interface is identical to the other hubs and it?s the best mobile Office suite we?ve seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? OneNote, Documents and SharePoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two more important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Word file support is very good. When reading a file, you can tap the Outline key to view a list of all titles from the document. The other way for navigating long files is the Find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s undo and redo options but strangely, there?s no way to create lists, like in OneNote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the biggest missing feature is copy and paste. That?s a huge miss for a document editor ? you can?t copy and paste parts of other documents, emails, messages, sites, nothing. We?re guessing many people will sooner or later find this omission quite frustrating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel viewer/editor is pretty good too, but like the Word editor it misses some features. You can add formulas to cells (though it?s not as easy as on the desktop Excel and there are fewer cells available), you can sort and filter the cells too, even merge some of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But cell formatting is limited to date, money or percentages. You can?t even change the currency sign. Another must-have missing is row and column insertion. Several sheets are supported but you get three by default and you can?t rename or delete them, nor add new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the viewers for Word, Excel and OneNote apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet more Windows Phone 7 video action - calendar and Office hubs:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications and stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Daily Briefing hub is a compilation of several applications ? it gives you one-click access to the weather in several cities, news for several countries and categories (including international) and stock quotes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Bing website, there are new photos every day to serve as background, but WP7 has one extra ? three squares on the photo, which give you three interesting facts about what?s in the picture. The copyright sign in the bottom right also reveals the location of the photo (e.g. ?Waterfall on the Arroyo del Salto River?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not useful per se, but it?s a nice ?Did you know...?? type of feature for the curious-minded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like any other Windows Phone 7, Samsung Omnia 7 has extensive voice recognition capabilities ? you just press and hold the Windows key and say your command. You can do things like ?Call Sarah at work?, ?Open calendar? and even ?What can I say?? if you?re not sure what commands you can do. It wasn?t very good at recognizing our commands though, hopefully it will improve with time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive is Microsoft?s cloud storage service and they offer 25GB of free storage (individual files must be 50MB max). You can integrate it with desktop Windows Explorer and it has some integration with Windows Phone 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now, you can upload photos including auto uploading of all pictures you snap with the camera. A nice option to have is whether or not to keep the geo-tagged data when uploading a photo online ? this works for SkyDrive and other services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps for getting from A to B without a hassle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia 7 comes with a built in GPS receiver and it was fast to acquire a lock and kept a strong reception. A-GPS is available and it speeds things up, but there?s no way to turn it off (it requires some data connection to do its magic).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Maps for mobile is the in-house application that Microsoft has prepared for use on their Windows Phone 7 smartphones. You can view either the regular map or switch to aerial view, which brings up the satellite imagery. Unfortunately, the cool Bird?s eye view isn?t available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, when you zoom in down to street level, Bing maps automatically switches to satellite imagery, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three softkeys available are for directions, my location and search (again, why a software key when there?s a perfectly good hardware one?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended menu has options to clear the map of any markers you?ve placed, toggling aerial view and accessing the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the map is easy and relatively fast. Zooming is done by pinching and for a bit of eye candy, when new tiles are loaded they fade in smoothly instead of just popping. Overall the effect is looks much smoother than on Google Maps for Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold places the marker on a specific location ? tap the marker and you get About (a map screenshot and the address, which you can send over a message or email) and Nearby, which shows nearby POI with a rating and basic info (like a phone and a web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get Directions from my location button, which will find step by step instructions to get you to your destination by either driving or walking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for what?s missing ? there?s no Navigate from here option, which can be quite useful. For example, you?re going to the theater, but want to check how far away the restaurant you?re going to afterwards is from the theater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still do that, but you can?t pick it from the map ? you have to use the search to find that location. Another thing ? you can?t add more than one destination when planning the route (Google Maps can?t do that either though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there was no trace of voice guided navigation either, even though Windows Mobile 6.x can do it. Perhaps it?s only a matter of time before Microsoft implements it for all regions since the official demo videos by Microsoft show that SatNav is available in the USA.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace reborn<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is still in its early stages but it?s already much better than what Windows Mobile 6 got. It has three sections ? applications, games and music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, Top, New, Free and finally, Categories which has the games sorted into genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? so, songs get mixed in with the apps and games. This is a little annoying since you don?t need song results while searching for an app and vice versa. But still, it?s not a major problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest problem with the new Marketplace is the shortage of apps. This is the most common problem when a new OS launches an app store. The number of apps and games will grow but the question is how fast. Of course, this is nothing a little developers challenge with a nice cash prize can?t sort out. As soon as Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7, over 50 new apps flooded the Marketplace, but it?s still in early stages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know. It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is simple to use as you can see from this video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The WindowsPhone.Live.com cloud has a silver lining<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has added extensive support for ?in the cloud? features in Windows Phone 7. The WindowsPhone.Live.com site is where you can access those features from your browser ? everything from remote wipe to browsing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Open the site in your browser and sign in with the Live ID that you use on your WP7 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once that?s done you have access to the Find My Phone features. You can make the phone ring or see its last location on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it turns out that your phone is lost, you can lock it and leave a ?please return? note on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you fear it?s been stolen, you can remote wipe it too (which erases all data from the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Live also lets you browse and edit contacts, calendar events and OneNotes too (those are edited with Office Live).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also browse photos you?ve uploaded to SkyDrive. We already mentioned that the camera of every WP7 phone can be set to automatically upload all pics you snap there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of SkyDrive, using Windows Live Mesh you can sync your computer with your SkyDrive account too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games you can play with friends<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We didn?t have many games to test, but the beefy hardware requirements ensure that Windows Phone 7 handsets won?t have any problems with complex games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 left us with mixed feelings, to say the least. WP7 devices have been designed around the OS, not the other way around. So perhaps, it?s best we look at the whole picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 is our first encounter with WP7-grade hardware and we walk away impressed. Microsoft has imposed some tough restrictions on what qualifies as WP7-ready. We?re talking top of the line processing power, large screens, powerful imaging and such.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that choosing between two Windows Phone 7 mobiles will be hard ? they match on so many points. It will be the special perks that each manufacturer can provide that will tip the scales one way or another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of the Omnia 7, Samsung?s one-of-a-kind 4? SuperAMOLED is a major incentive ? the only other phone to offer it is the Samsung Galaxy S. There are some good LCDs around but they don?t quite match the vivid picture and superior black levels of the SuperAMOLED tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung deserves a pat on the back for the metal Wave-style body and the excellent 5MP camera too. To summarize the review in one sentence ? the hardware is perfect, it?s the software that lets the phone down on occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep one thing in mind though ? Microsoft has done the hard part. They?ve gotten manufacturers excited enough about Windows Phone 7 and obviously has been convincing enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just think how many Android phones and also iPhone 3G and 3GS have been given a new lease of life with an OS update. The same could (and we?re guessing will) happen to Windows Phone 7 devices like the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 ? an update from Redmond will cure all those aches in the Cons section of the review. For example, reportedly copy and paste will be added in early 2011, and Microsoft is working on others as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, right now there are a few things missing. And our comment section is open for business. Just take a moment to think. Android and iOS didn?t quite have all the features they do now from day one, and yet they are doing fairly well on the market (that?s putting it mildly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the current crop of OSes, Windows Phone 7 is closer to iOS than Android. It takes the ?just works? approach and it?s Microsoft that dictates the major decisions about the OS. Android is more decentralized, and if you know what you?re doing, can be tuned and transformed to the user?s (or maker?s) taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, this is what you can expect from the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 ? it?s breaking new ground, much like the first iPhone, but lacks some features and flexibility. But unlike the first iPhone, the Omnia 7 has very few flaws in the hardware department: a large, hi-res screen, fast hardware, capable camera and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Restrictions from Microsoft have another positive side too ? it gives developers a common target to aim for and guarantees that each and every app they create will run trouble-free on each and every WP7 phone. Apps were critical for the iPhone?s success and are still important for every other mobile OS out there. Plus Samsung Omnia 7 and its likes will have no problems with OS fragmentation (or screen resolution) as Android does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But going back to this specific sample in the WP7 lineup, the Omnia 7 is a premium phone with a beautiful OS. It obviously has issues that can (and must) be fixed mid-flight. And since it?s our job to rate phones for what they are, not what they can be, we have no problem saying it: there are better phones than the Samsung Omnia 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, don?t be rushing to the nearest store just because it may be the next big thing. Make sure to give it a test drive instead ? and see if it?s the right one for you. Then of course, you don?t need anyone?s permission to go ahead and call it crap. Just try to sound credible.</paragraph>
