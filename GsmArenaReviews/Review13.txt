			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our homepage is the natural home of the deadliest smartphone carnivores. We normally don?t mind but this time is different. Are we about to start feeling a wee bit nervous or what. It?s a beast that tops the food chain, instilling fear and terror into the hearts of its prey. Our test lab is Jurassic Park, and the next predator we are about to meet is the T-Rex. Luckily we have a team of skilled keepers, capable of taming it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S has so much muscle that trying to impose your will with brute force is pointless. No sir, this creature needs to be befriended, patted on the back until it starts to trust you. But once it lets you jump on its back it will give you the ride of a lifetime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The largest Super AMOLED display in business is a great feat but the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S won?t stop there. The slim-fit case has room for a 1GHz processor and a 5 megapixel camera with HD video recording, while the Android 2.1 (Éclair) OS is the latest? uhh, wait a minute, there?s a weather update. We?re getting reports of a Froyo drizzle on Samsung?s party.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Éclair it is ? with the Samsung?s home-brewed TouchWiz UI on top, which we?ve already found to notably improve the usability of the interface. Oh, and you are also having a choice between 8 and 16 GB of internal storage, which should be more than enough to store those DivX and XviD videos the Galaxy S can play right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 28.07.11: We've added an overview of Samsung Dive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Is there really anything more to want in a full-touch smartphone? Of course there is ? it?s how all those parts come together. So let?s see how the Galaxy S does the math ? we start with ergonomics on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9000 Galaxy S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a surface measuring 122.4 x 64.2mm the Galaxy S is no small piece, but the 4? screen says it all. What?s more, the Super AMOLED technology has let Samsung bring the waistline down to the svelte 9.9mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That means the Galaxy S isn?t much trouble to fit in most pockets and it weighs the perfectly acceptable 118 g. Long story short, with this kind of specs you cannot expect anything smaller.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S will be pitched against the likes of the HTC Desire and the Nexus One. Simplicity was obviously the Google and HTC game. Samsung could?ve easily said ?It?s the screen, stupid!? and stopped bothering. But they didn?t ? and in the end ? the styling is perhaps one of the few questionable decisions in the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S is all made of plastic and there?s nothing wrong with that. It wasn?t a problem for the Omnia, the Omnia II or the Omnia HD. The thing is the blue-dotted back of the phone, while definitely an attention-grabber, is just not everyone?s cup of tea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But however eccentric, the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S back is nowhere near where most people will look. The magnificent 4? Super AMOLED display of WVGA resolution is as close to perfection as we have seen on a mobile phone and you just can?t help but admire it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have missed the preview, let us remind you what the Super AMOLED technology is all about. It retains the amazingly deep blacks that characterize the other AMOLED displays but gets the covering glass out of the way to vastly improve viewing angles and sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a look a the display test for the I9000 Galaxy S:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the most beautiful display to look at indoors doesn?t lose its charm in the open and the bright of day. The Galaxy S display viewing angles are bordering on perfection, onscreen content looking as if printed on paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity is as good as is to be expected in a capacitive touchscreen unit. The gentlest of touches will do, but gloves and styluses are a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a nutshell, the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S display is the key feature that will probably sell this phone to loads of users. So far, the choice of the best display was a matter of compromise for either resolution contrast or sunlight legibility. Super AMOLED units are in no mood to choose. They just let you have it all in one unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three keys only ? it?s the typically minimalist new Android wave. The touch-sensitive menu and back buttons are on either side of a hardware home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on the menu key launches the search field, so in effect users have a dedicated search key. As usual, pressing and holding the home key activates the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transition between the touch-sensitive screen and the touch-sensitive keys is seamless. The home key on the other hand, is well sized and solid to press, so no worries here either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power and screen lock key on the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is placed high up on the right side of the handset. It is a bit hard to reach but Samsung have used this spot on many of their handsets, so it shouldn?t be much trouble for those who come from another Samsung smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there's no dedicated camera key on the Galaxy S, which is a pity given the camera specs. 5 megapixel might not sound like much but HD video is a crowd pleaser. However, some customers may be disappointed with the lack of a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, we find the volume rocker, which provides enough pressing area and good enough feedback to make usage trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the I9000 Galaxy S has nothing but the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top of the phone is the tiny plastic lid that covers the microUSB port and the unprotected 3.5mm standard audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We complete our trip at the blue-dotted back of the phone. This is where the 5 megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker grill are located. There is no flash of any kind so low-light photography or video capturing is basically out of the question with the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover but luckily is hot-swappable. It handled a 16GB card trouble-free and support for 32GB is promised too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other element of interest under the Galaxy S back panel is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery. It has enough power to get the smartphone through more than three days of some rather heavy usage. You can find more info about its performance in the dedicated battery test that we conducted in our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S looks and feels quite sturdy. The general ergonomics are perfectly fine. Some users might find it awkward to handle a screen this size, but you know what you are signing up for right from the start. And the screen quality is worth all the fuss, take our word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We aren?t particularly impressed by the fingerprint-prone plastics used on the I9000 Galaxy S. This top-notch device certainly deserves better. Some metal would?ve made the phone too heavy to handle comfortably. But we?ve certainly seen better choice of finish from Samsung: the Galaxy Spica is a good example. Let?s say it again though, the Galaxy S has a screen to make all the rest irrelevant.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: TouchWiz takes Android to a new level<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Third time is the charm for Samsung and Android. On the I9000 Galaxy S, the TouchWiz overlay is most prominent and it improves both looks and usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You shouldn?t expect a miracle of course ? the user experience isn?t too different but many minor changes (and good ones at that) are there to be seen. The Android approach to touchscreen is pretty good to begin with, and the final result is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The customizations start on the homescreen where you have up to seven panes to populate with widgets. In our earlier unit there were 9 screens available but Samsung obviously thought this was either too much for the device to handle or more than any user will need. The good part is that you don?t have to use all the screens all the time. If you need less, deleting the extra ones will speed up the navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the option to set a default homescreen that we saw on the Galaxy Spica is not available. With the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S, the default homescreen pane is the leftmost not the central one. So if you have used all the screen panes navigation will involve a lot of side-scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also added 8 widgets of their own, available under ?Samsung widgets? when adding content to your homescreen. Those include four different clocks (Calendar, Weather, Dual and Yahoo Finance).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also the Feeds &amp; Update widget (shows social network status updates), Days (lets you snap a photo and displays upcoming events and notes, great for reminders) and Buddies now, which is similar to Photo contacts. The final Samsung widget is Daily Briefing, giving you an aggregated view of weather forecasts from AccuWeather, stock rates from Yahoo Finance, news feeds from Associated press and your upcoming appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, the Galaxy S has four buttons docked at the bottom of its homescreen, which stay there even when you open the menu. The rightmost button is the Applications/home button, which alternates the main menu and the home screen, and the other three you can change with whatever icon you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in vanilla Android). You can add new pages manually, by dragging an app to a new screen in edit mode. A list view is also available, just as on the HTC alternative, Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the launcher is in edit mode, you can uninstall applications (only the ones that you installed) just by tapping them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S packs all the updates brought by Android 2.1, like several new widgets and Live wallpapers. The Galaxy S even has more live images than the Google Nexus One and some of the new additions are downright impressive (mostly the pond). Just keep in mind that activating living wallpapers will put a strain on the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher has been untouched by the TouchWiz changes, but the notification area has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and sound toggles on top. These are quite handy when you need to turn any of these features on or off ? no more digging in the Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even better ? if there are no known Wi-Fi networks available when you switch WLAN on, a tab appears that lets you pick a network. This makes connecting to any Wi-Fi network a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen has been TouchWizified as well ? you now need to swipe upwards to remove the virtual lockscreen covering your phone. There are cool alternative unlocking patterns too when you have a missed event ? a message or a call. Strangely enough though, this Samsung I9000 Galaxy S unit lacks the Smart Unlock functionality ? something which our preview sample had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the changes that TouchWiz brings to the table make Android easier to use. The docked icons are the fastest way to launch the most commonly used apps. The toggles in the notifications area let you easily switch off unneeded radios to save battery. And adding more homescreen panes only as you need them is better than having mostly empty screens. In short, we like what Samsung have done with the place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S was great even in its early pre-release stages but the interface is now even faster and smoother. The Samsung Galaxy S 1 GHz Cortex A8 CPU is obviously doing a great job and the 512 MB of RAM on board feel more than enough. In case you are having RAM troubles (highly unlikely as it may be), you can download one of the free task managers from the Android Market and keep a tighter grasp on what?s using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 24 May: Initially our phone reported to have 256 MB of RAM memory, but after seeing so many sources claiming that the Galaxy S has 512 MB we contacted Samsung to clear this out for us. It turned out the Galaxy S will hit the shelves with good 512 MB of RAM on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The applications work consistently well and we can only imagine what a possible Froyo 2.2 update will do for the I9000 Galaxy S. Froyo is said to give a two to five times speed boost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the device in action in the video below that we snatched from our blog ? lags are very rare and not affecting the user experience at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we ran the usual benchmarks on the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S and weren?t really surprised to see it get the best scores yet. The 1GHz Hummingbird processor isn?t miles ahead of the Snapdragon inside the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and HTC Desire but it does have a slight edge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A typical Android smartphone, Samsung I9000 Galaxy S has a phonebook with massive functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory, SIM-stored and all Google contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place. You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen (courtesy of Samsung and the TouchWiz UI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android 2.1, the Galaxy S packs the new Quick contacts feature. It lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Android 2.1, there is also multiple account support for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have added another cool feature to the phonebook, which is also available in the Bada OS. In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the New message interface. The side-sweep thing works in other lists too where you have names or numbers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S caused us no trouble during calls. There were no reception issues or in-call voice quality drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? the implementation on the Galaxy S searches both contact numbers and names unlike the one on the Galaxy Spica, which went worked with numbers only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a demo video of the Samsung Galaxy S contacts management and telephony features. We're highlighting the swipe-to-call and swipe-to-sms feature in the phonebook, the fluid contacts scrolling, the intelligent smart dialing and the handy calls log options. The Buddies now homescreen widget also gets featured. It's well worth the look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the I9000 Galaxy S. It snatched a Below Average score, meaning missed calls are likely in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple - there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a red "Draft" label. What we really like is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending it or explicitly save it. The "undelivered messages" section has been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward and delete as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S also sports a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Text input, we love Swype<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text input is not usually a particularly exciting part of a review but the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is different. It features an on-screen QWERTY keyboard by Swype in both portrait and landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way Swype works is instead of tapping on keys you sweep a finger across the keyboard. To "type" quick, you need to put a finger on the Q key and sweep over to U, then I, then C and all the way to K. There's a visual trail that marks your finger movement across the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't matter if the trace goes over other keys, in fact you can't help it. But Swype recognizes the word you intended to enter with surprising accuracy - it correctly guessed "xylophone" without breaking a sweat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Swype is a novel way to type</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high precision means that even fast sweeps will be recognized correctly, so you can enter text very quickly and keep the error rate reasonably low. With shorter words, there might be several combinations possible - in that case Swype simply prompts you to pick which one you meant. It has a pretty big built-in dictionary, but you can teach it new words too (just type them out the regular way and they will be stored for next time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an excellent tutorial, which shows you step by step how to do everything with Swype - capitalizing, punctuation, how to write "soon" rather than "son" and a few other tricks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swype is very unobtrusive - it presents the user with a regular-looking QWERTY keyboard, on which you can type by tapping the keys the old-fashioned way. It's there if you like it - if not, you don't even have to turn it off or anything. Just type instead of sweep. Swype is cool though once you get the hang of it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3D gallery is cool, but downsizes the images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S gallery is identical to the one found on the Nexus One. That?s right, no TouchWiz customization here. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. The gallery boasts cool 3D effects and transitions, which we find rather attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos which fall in neat grids once selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you dig deeper into sub-folders, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back several levels to the folder you need (similar to how the Explorer on Windows 7 works).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S multi-touch support but you can also use double tap or even the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, you can't zoom images up to 100%. Obviously the gallery displays only downsized versions of your images and you need to transfer them to a computer if you're into pixel-peeping.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player ? 720p DivX/XviD clips are a cinch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is among the best performers in the Android family as far as video playback is concerned. In addition to packing a dedicated video player app (though playing videos through the gallery is still possible) it also has DivX and XviD video support, which is rare in the Google OS family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance with higher-res videos is great ? it played 720p videos like a champ. Little wonder, considering it can record 720p videos. There's a TV-Out feature (though it's only SD) or you could use the DLNA support to stream videos and photos to your DLNA-enabled TV or media player (any PC with Wi-Fi and DLNA-capable software would do too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the video player itself is as simple and as it could possibly be. You get a list of all videos available on the phone and the on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting thing you can find in the player is the Outdoor visibility setting. It boosts the brightness and contrast of your Super AMOLED screen to give you better viewing quality outside. The video recorder also sports this option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And last but not least the Galaxy S managed to get through 7 hours and 25 minutes of video playback before it battery reached 10 percent (at which point the player is automatically turned off) in our dedicated test. You can find more info about it in our blog.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is really nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz UI has reskinned the music player on the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S. The interface consists of several tabs for the sorting options: current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove those you don?t need, to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Samsung have enabled equalizer presets on the Galaxy S. The great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What's even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with the added eye-candy, album view and song scrolling, things are almost as good as they can get now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 6 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Perfect audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like many other things about this handset, the audio output of the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is downright impressive. The handset was reasonably loud and scored excellently on each and every reading in our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The signal-to-noise ratio is impressive and so are the flawless dynamic range and frequency response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortion levels are also top-notch and generally there is nothing about the Galaxy S audio quality that we can frown at. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android is staying out of the megapixel race and the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is no exception ? it packs a 5MP camera, which seems to be the norm for higher end Androids. This one?s pretty bare of accessories though ? no flash, not even a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is standard Samsung for the most part ? and that?s not a bad thing. It?s easily thumbable and offers readily accessible scene and shooting modes. Geotagging, face and smile detection are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first it appears that the lack of a dedicated shutter key and the virtual shutter key that?s not even half-pressable are to the detriment of the camera but once you get used to it, Samsung?s solution is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You use the touch focus feature to focus on your subject and tap the shutter key ? the camera auto-focus is among the fastest we?ve seen. This makes focusing on the subject (and possibly reframing the shot to observe the rule of thirds) by half-pressing the shutter obsolete. You frame the shot how you want it, focus on what you want and snap the photo ? it takes some getting used to, but in the end it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers a wide range of photography features, almost anything you can find in a cameraphone ? blink detection, image stabilization, geotagging, smile detection, face detection and auto contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality however is not the best in the 5MP league. There?s a fair amount of noise in the photos and even though the image processing algorithms suppress it, they also smear out the fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are also slightly underexposed but at least there are no highlights and clipping in the shadows.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. You can see how the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S image quality compares to that of some of the other handsets we have reviewed. Clicking any of the following three images will take you to our dedicated page for some pixel-peeping pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is in the elite club of mobile phones that shoot 720p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in 1280 x 720 pixels resolution at 30 fps ? unlike the Samsung i8910 OmniaHD and the Sony Ericsson Vivaz, which shoot videos at 24fps. The amount of resolved detail is good, noise levels are low ? the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is a worthy replacement of those pocket HD cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s takes some of the fun out however is the stuttering we found in all the videos we shot with the Galaxy S. It could be an issue of our specific unit so we?ll have to revisit that once the handset officially hits the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: After we received a final unit for testing we were pleased to find that the stuttering is gone and the videos are now excellently smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p video sample from our new test setup. Pay attention to the second half of the video where we lower the light to show you how the the camcorder performs in more challenging conditions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The I9000 Galaxy S covers its connectivity bases alright ? worldwide roaming ready quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to local connectivity ? the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), the new Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.1 enables file transfers via Bluetooth, so there?s little else left to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides its 16GB integrated storage, the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S supports microSD cards of up to 32GB. The slot is under the battery cover. There is also 2GB of ROM, with 1.8 GB free space for app installation. As you know Android 2.2 Froyo will enable installing apps on the memory card and the extra internal storage. Until then all Droid devices will have to rely on their inbuilt memory. Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is really a winner here with those 1.8 GB of free space - HTC Desire for instance offers only 120 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy S hassle-free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android is the product of the Web 2.0 era and its browser is excellent. With Éclair, the level of usability has reached competitive levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is completely minimalistic (it?s the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar and +/- zoom buttons. The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view and the zoom controls auto-hide ? that?s essential for web apps because they need to have the whole screen estate to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S browser supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and multitouch pinch-zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow ? a moment after adjusting the zoom level, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last castle of the Web that the Android Browser has yet to storm is Flash. It?s only with Froyo that it?s finally available in the core Android system. Samsung I9000 Galaxy S will have to wait for that update to dip its toes into the sea of Flash content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update:Now that the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S got the Android 2.2 Froyo update it's fully capable of running all kings of Flash content. There's also an on-demand option in the browser in case you want to save yourself some loading time and only download the elements you need. An excellent browser just got better. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S also packs YouTube app for easier browsing of the most popular video-sharing site.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S comes with the ThinkFree Office pre-installed ? it?s both a document viewer and an editor. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the Office package is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the inbuilt memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, comes the YouTube app which, as we said, partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash support. Its interface is simple enough to let you find whatever you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lots of good apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung filled the I9000 Galaxy S with tons of their home-brewed applications and we really appreciate their work. Most of them are quite useful and can be updated via Samsung Apps ? the second app repository on your phone. Whenever Samsung updates some of the current apps or widgets, or releases new ones, you?ll find them here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aldiko eBook is an e-reading app. It comes with three complimentary books, but they look kinda awkward. There are various font and color settings, but despite the big screen, it?s just not the best e-reading experience. Pages are side-scrollable only and for a mobile phone that doesn?t quite make sense. We know how paper books work, but why should we recreate their disadvantages in the digital world as well? Up-and-down scrolling of websites feels much more natural on a digital device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Daily Briefing is the same as the dedicated widget ? it shows the weather, stocks and your current schedule. The app works only in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with only text, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing Holy Grail ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Write and Go does almost the same job, but updates only your social network status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Dialer was a huge disappointment. It failed to recognize any of our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily Google Voice Search is onboard and it works great. The speech recognition is close to perfect and you won?t be disappointed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sketch Memo, the Image and Video editors also speak for themselves. The editor package offers various features and functionality and will get the job done if you need some basic editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Desk Home and Car Home are basic homescreens. They pack a bunch of shortcuts and show the time on a nice wallpaper. Obviously Desk Home offers optimization for when the handset is docked on your desk, while Car Home offers easily legible info and items for the times when you're on the go and you have the Galaxy S in a car stand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also provided their own IM and Email clients.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new addition to the application package of Samsung handsets is the popular Layar Reality browser. It?s a search app enhanced by augmented reality. Your search results for various POIs ? gas stations, hotels, parking, restaurants, shops, etc ? are returned and displayed in an augmented reality environment using the handset?s GPS and camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS with Google Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about three minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that Google Maps come preinstalled. Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation by Google Maps still has limited availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market is where you get the new apps from<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The number of apps in the market is ever growing and a recent survey showed that it has the highest free-to-paid apps ratio out of all the app stores. It?s just too bad they are low on 3D games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the Market shows several featured apps. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs and each tab lists sub-categories (e.g. Finance applications, Arcade &amp; Action games). In each category you can select to view the Top free apps or ones that are ?Just in?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a third tab ? Downloads ? that keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded. Do keep an eye on this tab ? when updates become available for an app you?ve installed, a label shows up next to the app name to notify you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications range from pretty silly (including one that simulates a doorbell), through fun (e.g. a virtual guitar) to real must-have's (including task killers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo will allow installing apps on the memory card, so new elaborate apps and killer games are likely to appear as soon as it is released. This will improve the Android Market?s chances to catch-up with the Apple AppStore.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Dive locates your device, remote wipes it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Competition between phone makers is getting really heated, so they're offering more and more free services to lure in customers. Samsung Dive is a prime example - it's a phone finder/remote wipe service, something which used to be a premium, corporate-centric feature back in the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The officially supported devices currently include the Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, along with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Tab 8.9 and the Samsung Wave. That's it, even the Galaxy S Plus isn?t listed. An exception we found is that the Samsung Wave II is supported too even though it's not on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the show here is the Remote Controls feature (actually, it's the only feature). It can locate your phone or you can set it to track the phone for 12 hours on, recording its position every 15 minutes. If you?ve only misplaced your phone, say, it?s behind the couch or your dog?s been using it as a bite toy (true story!), there's an option to ring the phone out loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if it turns out that the phone isn't in the house you have the option to lock the phone, wipe its memory and check the call logs to see if there were any calls made from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locking the phone lets you enter a message to display on the device (up to 100 characters) and you can enter a phone number, which will be the only number callable from the locked phone (you'll also get an SMS to that number if the SIM card is changed). A 4-digit PIN is also required, which can later be used to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that if you choose to wipe the device, you'll no longer be able to use Samsung Dive on it. You can re-register if you find it, but tracking will no longer work, which means remote wiping is your last resort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When trying to locate your device, you have two options - Find my phone and Track my phone. They may sound alike, but they do differ a bit. Track my phone records the phone's location in 15-minute intervals over a period of over 12 hours and plots the locations on the map (Google Maps is used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, for it to work, the phone needs to have a GPS lock - the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning won't cut it. So, if the phone is in a building or in another area with poor GPS signal, tracking won't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find my phone works fine with the less accurate options but it only shows the phone?s current location and it won't record past positions. The nice thing is that even if all location options were set to off before the handset was misplaced, those will be enabled automatically as soon as you start looking for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike HTCSense.com, Samsung Dive is purely for locating your device or remote wiping it. There are no options to view/manage contacts or messages or anything like that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We tested the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S and it tested us in return. It bared its teeth at us and so did we. Ours was a grin. Easy boy, good beast. There goes the new leader of the Android pack. The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S has oomph to spare and even hardened geeks like us cannot help but acknowledge its compelling power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only does the Galaxy have a performance edge over its competitors, it's probably better too in terms of usability thanks to TouchWiz. And the majestic Super AMOLED display is a great reason on its own to buy the Galaxy. Be warned though, you're unlikely to ever go back to TFT again. Meaning that at this point, the question to ask yourself is whether you're ready for a long-term affair with Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are looking for the ultimate Android device, there are very few things really to make you consider another handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing would be still imaging. If that matters more to you than video, have a look at the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. It gives you an (almost) equally capable CPU, a tad higher screen resolution but runs Android 1.6 Donut, which - Froyo or not - looks downright outdated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mentioning Android 2.2, the Google Nexus One will certainly be one of the first devices to get it. Froyo brings a handful of new features and a vast performance improvement so it will put compatible devices to an obvious advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC also confirmed that their latest smartphones will be getting the Android 2.2 treatment before the end of the year so the Sense UI-packing Desire is worth a second look, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest though, the AMOLED displays of the Desire and the Nexus One are nowhere near the Galaxy S standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Google Nexus One ? HTC Desire</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there comes the Motorola MILESTONE for those that do need a full QWERTY keyboard. The MILESTONE will also be among the first Froyo adopters so it has quite a lot of potential. It doesn't obviously offer the same kind of processing power, nor a display that impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this raises the pricing issue. We have no idea what the Galaxy S will cost but Samsung's recent record does offer some reason to be cautiously optimistic. The price of the other Super AMOLED device, the Samsung S8500 Wave, is a good reference. So, if our intuition is right the Galaxy S will be a great deal. If we're wrong, the best screen in business will cost you dear. At least, it won't be a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is coming to the market a bit late it hasn't been wasting its time. It certainly is the best Android package we've seen so far - a hearty Samsung welcome to all upgraders. We're not sure about Android newcomers, but anyone looking for the ultimate performance has almost no alternatives but the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
