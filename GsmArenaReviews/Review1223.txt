			<paragraph>This sure looks like a non-starter. Comparing Windows Phone handsets is about as constructive as deciding which is right and which is left in a pair of socks. HTC and, to a lesser extent, Samsung have been making sure though there's no shortage of phones to choose from. And now with Nokia pulling their socks up to stay in the smartphone game, the choice is even greater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today our focus is on the Samsung I8350 Omnia W and the Nokia Lumia 710. For a change, they step out of the shadow of their bigger, more capable siblings. In fact, the entire Windows Phone range finds itself struggling to catch up with the general trend towards higher screen resolution and multiple-core processing. The first WP7generation was thrown in the deep end while the fresh Mango-running crowd has a seemingly easier task of staying afloat in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phones like the Omnia W and Lumia 710 are likely to be considered even by first-time smartphone users and that's one of the reasons why we think this comparison may be helpful. The two handsets are almost on par pricewise and the same goes for most of the specs too. We have a 3.7" display each and it's tie in imaging too: 5 MP still cameras with 720p video. Both have the same processors and run the most recent version of Windows Phone 7.5 - Mango.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But here's where it gets interesting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 710 over Samsung Omnia W:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much of it will come down to personal taste, but there's enough to tip the scales either way. The Super AMOLED screen is a massive point in Omnia W's favor, but the Lumia is keen to raise the bid with Nokia Drive - the company's free voice-guided navigation system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get busy exploring the major aspects of the performance of these phones by pitting them against each other in various tests: still cameras, video recording, audio quality and battery backup. As usual though, we start off with the build and finish.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It wasn't long ago that 3.7" was considered the sweet spot in display size. With mobile phone screens pushing well above 4 inches we're not so sure anymore. Both the Nokia Lumia 710 and the Samsung Omnia W are on the small side compared to some of today's flagships, but 3.7" is more than reasonable for an affordable smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia is the bigger of the two, which suggests that the Omnia W uses space more efficiently. The Finn is about 10 g heavier too at 125.5 g, a bit of a surprise considering it's entirely made of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curvy all around and finished in plastic, the Lumia 710 looks more ordinary of the two, bordering on cheap. In contrast, the angular Omnia W does come across as more masculine and businesslike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note though that we have no qualms with the build quality of the Lumia 710. And we acknowledge the effort to position the device as the more affordable alternative of the Lumia 800 and 900. The Lumia 710 is supposed to attract a younger audience and probably put novice smartphone users at ease. The exchangeable back covers are a relevant addition to the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the classier Samsung Omnia W is based on a more grownup design. It has a distinct upmarket feel, which even some of Samsung's premium Android smartphones fail to match. The Gorilla Glass-covered Super AMOLED display creates a pleasant illusion of seamless, bezel-free front. The brushed aluminum inset on the battery cover adds to the high-end look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones go for clean design, with minimal or no embellishments. The brushed aluminum inset on the battery cover of the Omnia is a strong but subtle accent. The Lumia has no fancy finish but the extra paintjobs are a welcome option. Overall, there's a clear distinction in the demographics targeted. The Lumia is likely to resonate with the younger crowd, while the Omnia W might appeal to a more mature and professional audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feeble loudspeaker of the Lumia 710 is hardly a surprise following our disappointment with both the Lumia 800 and the N9. At first glance the ample-sized grille at the bottom might be taken to imply a lot of bang but sadly there isn't much going on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W isn't all that loud either, despite edging slightly higher than the Lumia. You're not likely to miss many calls but don't expect to blast your favorite tunes on the loudspeaker either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't much to say really about software differences. The two devices are running Windows Phone version 7.5 Mango. Equality is ingrained in the platform's philosophy although, at this point at least, it seems they're enforcing austere uniformity rather than promoting equal opportunity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Their survival as a leading smartphone manufacturer at stake, Nokia have understandably put extra effort to make their WP7 line stand out in the crowd. With any Lumia phone you get a complete SatNav solution with downloadable maps absolutely free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other household names are Nokia Maps, App Highlights and Nokia Music, but some of them are or will be available platform-wide soon enough. App Highlights offers a selection of apps to get you started, while Nokia Music works as a general music player but with a location-aware twist. You also get access to the Nokia Music store, which is an alternative to the Zune Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The platform limitations put the Samsung WP7 phones at an obvious disadvantage. With Zune the only means of file transfer and the Scorpion chipset, the Omnia W hasn't got the wide video codec support you can expect in comparable Android smartphones by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone is taking steps to widen its base of supported chipsets and about to transition to multicore processing and higher-res screens. Although WP7-powered phones have clearly fallen way behind their Android and iOS competitors, the gap in the midrange isn't as dramatic. The Lumia 710 and the Samsung Omnia W are lucky to avoid the heavy competition. The two are sensible midrange packages offering the smooth handling and minimalist appeal of the Metro UI, with a strong social network dimension.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 3.7" these two competitors make a lot of sense in their price bracket, and the WVGA resolution is about par for the course too. Both phones offer the same amount of screen real estate and the exact same number of pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key difference here is the display technology. Nokia have put a ClearBlack TFT unit on the Lumia 710, which offers above average brightness of nearly 700 nits and accurate color rendering. Samsung are using one of their Super AMOLED displays on the Omnia W and, although it's the PenTile variety, it delivers the trademark deep blacks and excellent contrast and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia are always to be trusted for a reliable outdoor performance of their screens. The ClearBlack display of the Lumia 710 achieved impressive contrast ratio of over 1000:1 and it's only a certain color shift when viewed by certain angles that gets in its way to perfection. However there's also no denying that Windows Phone and AMOLED are a match made in heaven - the Metro UI is best appreciated on a screen that knows how to handle its blacks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The imaging department is where the Omnia W and Lumia 710 are absolute equals, at least on paper. Both offer 5 MP cameras on the back for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. It's a single LED flash each too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You know we're the kind who loves running tests, filling scores into charts and going on and on about the results. So we pitted the two and we even threw the HTC Radar here and there just for the fun of it. Three is a crowd but we'll have to cope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with our photo comparison tool. It lets you compare the Omnia W vs the Lumia 710 in three different types of shots. Further down we've prepared custom crops with focus on key areas in the charts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The Nokia Lumia 710 and the Samsung Omnia W in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a crop from the first test chart. It points to the maximum resolution the cameras are able to resolve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the horizontal and vertical resolutions tell the same story. The Omnia resolves them slightly better than the Lumia. The HTC Radar is obviously struggling here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W is slightly better, but by a small margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second chart concentrates on image processing - the way the phone's camera deals with noise and different objects and surfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos of both phones seem equally good. They both have their differences in processing but for all practical purposes, this test is a tie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is trailing behind again - it's too hard on the detail while trying to reduce noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last poster deals with color rendering and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W tends to slightly oversaturate colors, while the Lumia's images are more laid back in colors. We won't go as far as picking a winner, it's your call here. We don't think any of the phones has an upper hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not surprisingly, the Radar's result are quite bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality wise the two phones seem to be quite close so we'll call this one even for both sides.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both devices offer 720p video recording, which isn't the king of the hill anymore but is still high-quality video if it's done right. We'll start the comparison with our video comparison tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Lumia 710 in our Video Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the synthetic resolution chart again. Without question, the Lumia 710 rules here. It resolves the most detail and it, actually, is the only device in the test to resolve any individual lines in both the vertical and horizontal cones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W and HTC Radar are both equally qualified for the second spot but the Omnia W is a tad sharper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second test is our regular miniature scene. This crop shows the scene in good light where all three devices can show their best performance. Again the Lumia offers the sharpest video of all three - and by quite a margin. Text is readable and detail is superb, which is more than we can say about the Omnia W and Radar's results. The Lumia also records stereo sound, if a bit on the quiet side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the darker lighting scene, the Lumia 710 again wins without competition. It deals way better with shadows and highlights than the Omnia and manages to keep colors natural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 completely trumps the competition here. It's a really capable video performer even outside its OS. It produces wonderfully detailed videos with sharp and accurate colors and noise is kept in check. Smoothness is top notch as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There isn't much to say about the differences in performance between the Lumia and the Omnia. They both use the same 1.4 GHz Snapdragon chipset with the same Adreno 205 GPU, and have the same number of pixels to work with and the same OS version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Practically, there isn't anything to set these two apart. We conducted our regular tests - BrowserMark, SunSpider adn the Internet Explorer Fish Tank test and the results we're for the most part on par.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If audio reproduction quality is important to you, then you have little choice but to side with the Samsung Omnia W. Not that it's perfect or anything, but the Lumia 710 is one of the most disappointing performers our testing lab has seen. When no headphones are attached, the Omnia W has only average intermodulation distortion, slightly sub-par frequency response and excellent results elsewhere. The Lumia 710, on the other hand, has disastrous intermodulation distortion, poor frequency response and pretty good readings in the other tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's more a case of picking the lesser of two evils here, but that's undoubtedly the Omnia W.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Differences get even more pronounced when a pair of headphones comes into play. The Omnia W slightly improves its frequency response, but adds some extra distortion and stereo crosstalk. The Nokia Lumia 710 retains the same distortion levels (but those are quite high anyway), lets a similar amount of stereo crosstalk creep in and still struggles to find the right frequency response. Really, not the right choice for audiophiles, that Nokia smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't run complete battery tests for the Lumia 710 and the Omnia W, focusing instead on web browsing and video playback only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W has a larger capacity battery and, although 200 milliamps doesn't sound like that much, it made quite a difference in the tests. In the web browsing test, the Omnia W managed to last 2 hours and 40 minutes longer than the Nokia Lumia, which is most likely a mix of the bigger battery and the more power-efficient Super AMOLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video playback, the Lumia fails even more miserably. The Samsung Omnia W manages 7 hours and 49 minutes against the pitiful 3 hours and 27 minutes of the Nokia smartphone. Again the Super AMOLED display uses less energy to display blacks and doesn't put such a strain on the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Poor battery life is something you can't overlook. Nokia could've done a better job there. The Samsung Omnia W has an advantage that counts - many users will appreciate good battery backup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It really is a close call between the Lumia 710 and the Omnia W. If you started  here , you'd think there's no story to tell. Of course, it's the (sometimes minor) details that set these virtually identical phones apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 710 does better at video recording but is failed by its battery in both video playback and web browsing. The Omnia has a slightly better still camera and clearly superior battery backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other major deciders besides battery performance are the difference in screens and the software bundle. A Super AMOLED screen lets you fully appreciate the beautiful simplicity of the Metro UI and the Omnia W has a clear advantage over regular TFT displays. However, the Nokia Lumia isn't too far behind - its ClearBlack display has more than decent contrast and commendable brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exclusive applications have always given Nokia smartphones the edge, and the free lifetime SatNav license is a major point in Lumia's favor. On a second thought, given the predominantly younger audience being targeted, voice-guided navigation doesn't seem as the most relevant of features. Nokia Music would make more sense perhaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we're looking at two budget smartphones and the actual price tags should count as well. Samsung and Nokia are competing on both sides of the ocean with these two by the way. In Europe it's the Lumia 710 against the Samsung I8350 Omnia W. Stateside, T-Mobile's Lumia 710 is facing AT&amp;T's Samsung Focus Flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 seems likely to outsell its Samsung rival - not because it's slightly cheaper but due mainly to a significant novelty factor currently at play. It seems Samsung have acknowledged the Nokia threat by significantly discounting their Focus Flash in the US. At launch, AT&amp;T offered it for 50.00 USD with a two-year contract, while the current price is 0.99 with a two-year commitment to a plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 may lose customers to the better equipped Lumia 800 and perhaps the likes of the N8 and the Nokia 701, given a new lease on life by an update to Symbian Belle. The Samsung Omnia W, on the other hand, will be hard at work to keep users from looking away at plenty of midrange Samsung droids. It's a game of ups and downs, but these two friendly smartphones can offer the right users a nice mix of performance and style at a bargain.</paragraph>
