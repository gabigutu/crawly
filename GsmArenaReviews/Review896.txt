			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 knows it will need to fulfill the promises made by the Oppo Find 5. The latter essentially placed the company on the international map but the newcomer does look like a much improved and mature product that will aim even higher. The Find 5 was designed to impress and had an amazing screen - a solid foundation for the N1 to build on, and it doesn't fail. What's more, Oppo takes on from there with courage and creativity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Prior to release, Oppo went over and beyond to promote the upcoming smartphone with regular YouTube teasers and sneak peeks, getting CyanogenMod's top man, Steve Kondik, on board. That collaboration will bear fruit in a limited edition Oppo N1 with a CyanogenMod ROM but the one we're about to have a closer look at runs the company's homebrewed Color OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android manufacturers (Chinese ones nonetheless) are keen to have their own take on Android - we've seen Meizu's Flyme OS on a few occasions, Huawei's got Emotion UI and Xiaomi has the MiUi. This is our second encounter with Oppo's Color OS, and it has improved quite a lot from what we remember on the Find 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get into the spec sheet in a little more detail. It's a list that's meant to impress and occasionally wow and it dully delivers on those points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main focus is undoubtedly on the display and camera but Oppo did well to fill in the details - there's an immense battery, ample 2GB of RAM and a solid connectivity set. It's the Snapdragon 600 chipset that looks a bit out of place. Not that you should worry about general speed and responsiveness, but it just doesn't provide as much in terms of future-proofing as the Snapdragon 800 . And it can't manage 4K video recording, which is a potential eyebrow-raiser in a package that bets so heavily on imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is the most obvious attention-grabber, the lens placed on a 206°-rotating module, which has the earpiece and proximity sensor on one side and the 13MP camera with dual-LED flash on the other. A rotating camera design scores big on exclusivity in the current smartphone game, although we can't discount Nokia's early efforts in the field with the 3250 and N90. Maybe that's what Oppo meant with "Back to innovation".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly though, the N1's camera has hardware you rarely see in a smartphone, and the software backing to make it count in more than just high-resolution selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's obvious Oppo has gone all out with the N1 - the screen, the camera, the OS, the design and the marketing. The company wants to be heard and seen and it sure looks like they have something to show. We're eager to explore and our next stop is hardware. It goes without saying that the only way the N1's going to get its back scratched is by us testing the rear touchpad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Boxes within box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 comes in a flat retail box with separate little boxes inside for the various accessories, for a premium touch to the packaging. One little box holds the O-Connect Bluetooth accessory (remote shutter), while the cable of the bundled earphones with volume controls wraps around the slotted sides of another container. A pin is supplied too for ejecting the SIM card, as well as an A/C adapter with detachable USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The O-Click Bluetooth accessory is good-looking and quite efficient. Using Bluetooth 4.0 LE it will pair with the handset and serve several useful purposes. You can make the phone ring the remote or the remote ring the phone. The O-click easily fits on a keychain, so you'll no longer scramble for misplaced keys. It works the other way around too - finding a misplaced phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remote can be set to start beeping if you walk out of connection range to make sure you don't leave without your phone. The O-click will also flash upon incoming calls or messages if you have the phone on silent and it can also double as a camera shutter remote.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Oppo N1 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo went big on its latest flagship. With the rotating camera module and ample space below the screen for the capacitive buttons, the Oppo N1 is taller than devices of similar screen size like the Nokia Lumia 1520 and the HTC One Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's massive Xperia Z Ultra is perhaps the only one that comes to mind that's notably bigger - but it does have a larger 6.4" screen to show for it. The Samsung Note 3 is impressively compact in comparison, and the difference in screen diagonal is negligible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight is about average for the sample. At 213g, the Oppo N1 is right between the Lumia and One Max. So is thickness, at the reasonable 9mm - which is still nowhere near though the Z Ultra's 6.5mm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, for a gadget that's not exactly subtle - we're talking a phablet with a near 6" screen - the Oppo N1 is a seriously good-looking slab. The device has an aluminum alloy frame going around its sides and the back is treated to an impressively sleek soft finish, which is great to the touch and virtually impervious to fingerprints, while offering excellent grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is dominated by the immense screen, with the three capacitive buttons enjoying plenty of space at the bottom. At this size though, they are almost unusable in a single-hand scenario - reaching all the way down to them you risk dropping the N1 almost every time. It's a top-heavy device too, which certainly doesn't help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, the earpiece and sensors are on one side of the rotating bit, the 13MP camera and two LED flashes on the other. There are two flashes - one is a bright LED for regular shots (when the camera is pointed back), but when you turn the camera beyond a certain angle, the phone uses automatically the diffused one so your selfies turn out with a more pleasing skin tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera piece is really easy to rotate but still with just enough resistance. Turning it half the way (beyond 120 degrees) automatically starts the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating part is a highly complex component with some 50 cables going in and out. No doubt, this would rig a bell of warning to anyone old enough to remember the numerous faulty ribbon cables in slider and clamshell phones, but the company claims it has put the module through rigorous tests and says it should withstand some 100,000 rotations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are subtle chrome accents that work well against the pure white paint. The Oppo logo is engraved at the back, the rotating piece, as well as the sides of the phone have slim metal framing. The camera lens, and the couple of LEDs are encircled in metal, while the earpiece and the loudspeaker have the same grille pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By placing the camera lens on a rotating piece, Oppo has ensured an almost clinically clean back panel. It has a microphone and company logo and seemingly nothing more. Located under the OPPO insignia, the O-Touch pad is as good as invisible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera and screen are the highlights on the Oppo N1 and clever design makes sure they get all the attention. The phablet is big and heavy, no doubt about that, but the styling is as clean as it possibly can, yet with great attention to detail. We like the sparing use of accents and are delighted with the finish - that goes to premium feel and excellent grip in equal measures, the latter being essential in a device of this size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.9" screen there's the 206°-rotating module, which holds the earpiece and proximity sensor on one side and the 13MP camera and couple of LEDs on the other. If you enable it in the settings, rotating the swivel top will automatically launch the camera. Of course, it will launch in self-portrait mode - after all these are the highest-resolution selfies we can think of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the screen you'll find a familiar three button layout. These are Home, Back and Menu and are all capacitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Oppo have different duties. Near the top on the left side of the phone is the SIM tray, which takes a dedicated eject pin to pull open. On the opposite side you'll find the power and volume buttons placed a little lower than usual, so as to be comfortably within reach. The power/lock key may see less use than usual, as the Oppo N1's screen can be double-tapped to wake up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing at the top of the Oppo N1, while on the bottom there's a 3.5mm headphone jack, a microUSB port and a recessed speaker grille. The frame around the device is nicely etched out to provide room for these three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Oppo N1 has the company logo, a noise-suppressing microphone and the O-Touch pad, which enables more ways to interact with the device. Scrolling (screens and lists) is the most typical scenario but you can set it to launch apps too. We had a double tap start and stop the camera but it can be any app really, from the dialer to the torch. The touchpad can serve as a shutter key too - as in tap to focus, release to capture. It also lets you control music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's placed right where you'd want it to be and the idea is to help single-handed use but the O-Touch isn't that comfortable after all. It's the sheer size of the device - it'll take a bit of time to find the proper way to hold the N1 securely enough and slide a finger on the touchpad to scroll with reasonable speed and precision. On the other hand, when the O-Touch is enabled accidental taps are likely to launch an app or scroll away from what you're looking at when you're only trying to adjust your grip on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the most usable scenario for us was holding the device landscape in both hands and browsing pictures using the rear touchpad - which is still something. Nothing obscures the actual content and having a few smudges less on the touchscreen is always a good thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this size, the Oppo N1 is not a device to comfortably use single-handedly - but that's true for almost any phablet out there. That said, the O-Touch provides a somewhat usable solution in some cases but there's no getting around the fact that for most purposes you'd need to use both hands to operate the Oppo N1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a phablet after all, and that means you're here for the big screen to begin with. So, let's see what you're getting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Easily one of the key selling features of the device, the 5.9" screen of the Oppo N1 has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, resulting in around 373ppi. Oppo puts the screen brightness at 450 nits, not all that much for an IPS LCD like the N1's but in reality the screen looks pretty bright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardly a surprise for an IPS unit, the side viewing angles are excellent - it's a high-quality screen, no doubt about that. The screen's digitizer is super-sensitive and the phone can be used with gloves (if you turn that on in the settings menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB with an equal amount of green, red and blue pixels in a line. Below you can see it magnified using our trusty microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast of the screen is pretty good and about in line with the excellent Find 5 display. Color reproduction is also pretty great adding up to great image quality screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only sub-par element of the otherwise great display is its sunlight legibility. The less than stellar brightness combined with the very high reflectivity add up to pretty poor contrast when exposed to direct sunlight.

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 did fabulously in our dedicated battery life test but that was to be expected from a battery this big. The N1 makes use of a 3610 mAh battery. True, it?s not removable, but you won?t need to keep a spare with that sort of endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, it took us the amazing 25h of talk time on a 3G network to bring this battery down. Next up was our dedicated web browsing test where it endured for more than 9h. And finally, our dedicated video test ran for a total of 11h 15min before the battery ran flat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took into account the standby battery consumption with the screen off and we came up with our proprietary battery rating of 79h. That means that the Oppo N1 battery should be good for more than 3 full days given that you use it for an hour of calls, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video watching every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We rarely see scores north of 60h around here, so 79h is almost as good as it gets for a smartphone these days. The N1 also slides between its two main rivals - the HTC One Max (81h) and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (75h).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Color OS atop Android Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By default the Oppo N1 runs on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean skinned heavily and turned into what the company calls Color OS. The customizations runs very deep and while not removing any Google apps and services adds quite a few of its own, while replacing the lockscreen, homescreen, app drawer and the settings menu among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not into custom launchers you also get the option to download the Cyanogen Mod ROM from the company's website. The company has even launched a dedicated CM version of the N1, which ships with the popular custom ROM preinstalled, but even if you missed on that one, you still have a chance to switch to it with a simple install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, Dec 30: We flashed our review unit with the first stable CyanogenMod ROM available for the Oppo N1. It's CyanogenMod 10.2, which is based on Android 4.3. All features and hardware work just as well as under Color OS, so just so you know, you can always go down this route if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we covered the CyanogenMod ROM, read further down for our review of the Color OS that ships with the N1 by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick Color OS rundown on video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off let's cover the Color OS lockscreen. It's almost identical to the stock Android one. There's an unlock ring, which you slide to get to the homescreen. You can have widgets on the lockscreen, which are located to the left of the main window, while on the right there's a camera shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a hidden flashlight shortcut - a press and hold of the Home button turns on the dual-LED flash. It goes out when you let go of the Home button. Note that you have to wake the screen for this to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also have a password or pattern lockscreen, or none at all. A double tap on the screen will wake up the phone as well so you don't need to reach for the power key. On a device this big, this certainly makes a big difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the LG G2, the Oppo N1 has a guest mode. It only gives access to apps that you've selected so you have no problem sharing your phone without worrying about your private data or your settings getting all messed up. In order to use Guest Mode you'll need to set up a pattern or password unlock for regular access and one for Guest Mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen of the Oppo N1 likes to keep things huge. Before with the Oppo Find 5 we argued that icons are too big on the 1080p 5" screen - they were organized in a grid of 4x5. Well the Oppo N1 is actually worse. You get a 5.9" screen but apps above the dock are organized in a grid of 4x4. Widgets could be optimized better for the large screen, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the up side, you can add up to 9 homescreen panes, when most custom launchers top out at 7 (the stock Android one is fixed at 5). You can re-arrange them and delete the ones you don't need through the popular overview mode you enter with a pinch out gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen is reserved for the dock. You can have any shortcuts or folders you like here - you can even move the app drawer shortcut (but not remove it altogether as you won't be able to access it). The dock has four shortcuts (Dialer, Messaging, App drawer and Camera) by default, but you can actually fit a fifth one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is pretty simple - it has horizontally scrollable pages of 20 shortcuts or folders. A small green dot marks newly installed apps that haven't been launched yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dragging a shortcut to the homescreen doesn't work the way you're used to - the default action is to rearrange shortcuts in the app drawer, you have to move it over the "Drag app to homescreen" area that appears at the bottom instead. This just slows down the most commonly used function - dragging shortcuts onto the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the notification area will show one row of quick toggles, a brightness slider and a shortcut for enabling auto brightness mode, the current notifications plus a shortcut to go into settings. If you do a drag gesture from the quick toggles row you get two more lines of toggles. There's also a Kill all apps button there. At the bottom of the notification area sits a clear button to remove all your notifications at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on a toggle will bring up its respective settings entry. By the way you can access the notification area even if you slide down from any empty part of the homescreen (not just the top), which helps single-handed use a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is pretty close to stock Android. All your apps are shown in a vertically-scrollable grid of thumbnails, which you swipe either side to close or tap to open. Oppo has added a kill all toggle at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By holding a finger on an empty spot on the homescreen or performing a swipe up from the dock you open up the contextual menu. It lists widgets, wallpapers, effects and themes.You drag widgets upwards to place them on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exclusive space is Oppo's custom homescreen page. Currently there are only two available - Photo and Music. Photo space takes up a whole homescreen and features a live viewfinder so you can take shots straight from your homescreen plus a shortcut to the full camera app. On the bottom there are four shortcuts - camera, gallery, app drawer and favorite apps. Those are four app shortcuts which you can access from the Exclusive space. In between you get a timeline with all your recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Exclusive space features a cool, if slightly intuitive design with a vinyl for changing the currently playing song and stopping/resuming playback. You can change songs, go directly to the music player or the Phone app. More Exclusive spaces are coming through soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes currently has two available themes. The first one is the default Color OS one and the other one is a stock-looking one, which changes the homescreen, app icons and app drawer and basically looks like stock Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. It's not the CyanogenMod we mentioned earlier but it comes pretty close in terms of looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the wallpaper with live or static ones and change the scrolling effect of the homescreens. There's one more option - Live Weather - it can flicker snow, rain, dandelions, etc. over the screen. The effect is very impressive - for instance snow would pile up on your dock icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Gesture panel. You access it just like you would open your notification area, but you need to start your swipe in the left quarter of the bar at the top, just as if you were pulling down the notification area. You can perform various gestures in the Gesture panel to open different apps. For instance drawing a circle would open the camera app but you can assign any apps to any gestures you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is divided in three tabs - General, Sound and Display. Each category has a vertical list of settings and it all works pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Daydream is available through the Interactive screensaver. You can choose colors, Google photos, photo frame and photo table - each shuffling images as your screensaver. By default the screensaver appears while docked or charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The O-Touch menu lets you setup the touchpad on the back of the device. If enabled you can swipe left and right in the O-Touch area, double-tap to open an app (like camera or the flashlight), tap and hold to take photos in the camera, control music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there's the Gesture &amp; motion menu - it holds all the various gesture and motion shortcuts, which can be enabled and disabled. For one you can rotate the camera module to launch it (or disable the feature), swipe with three fingers on the screen to capture a screenshot, pinch-close with multiple fingers to launch the camera and more. The motion options are very useful - flipping the device will mute the ringer, raising a ringing Oppo N1 to your ear will automatically answer the call and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall Color OS strives to be more feature rich than Android and has deep-digging customizations but is still Android. Users familiar with the OS won't have trouble getting to learn the OS and we're glad Oppo added features that help using the device with one hand like O-Touch, swiping down from anywhere to reveal the notification area, launching apps with gestures, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced back in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting aspects of the Android OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your daily routines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by holding the home button or through the Google Search app. Google Now gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now in the form of cards. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now, if you allow it, can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts) and what distance you've walked in a particular month. The last one could definitely feel creepy for some users, but it's easily turned off from the Google Now settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions into Now. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters. All you need to do in order to initiate Google Now's voice actions is, once you've opened the app, say OK Google and start commanding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google Now is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now set reminders straight from Google Now's UI. Just hit the bottom left icon (the palm with a stretched index finger). There you can add reminders or just check all the past, ongoing or upcoming reminders.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 comes with a Snapdragon 600 chipset, which is not exactly top of the range any more. The Snapdragon 800 is already powering a dozen flagships, while its Snapdragon 805 successor is just around the corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that four Krait 300 cores is something to frown at, but they don't allow for the same instantaneous loading times or stuff like 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let's dig right into it. Starting off with BenchmarkPi and Linpack. Both focus on the processing skills - BenchmarkPi evaluates the performance of individual cores while Linpack stresses multi-threaded performance. In both cases the Oppo N1 performed as expected - matching its Snapdragon 600 peers and falling somewhat short of the Snapdragon 800 monsters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 3 is about the CPU and memory performance. Here the Oppo N1 posted a surprisingly low result, barely beating the mid-range R819 and coming behind several Snapdragon S4 smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 4 and Quadrant are both compound benchmarks. AnTuTu places the Oppo N1 neck and neck with the Snapdragon 600-yellding Galaxy S4 while Quadrant has a place for the Oppo N1 in the bottom half of the table.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark is a GPU benchmark. The off-screen 2.7 and 2.5 tests show the maximum output the Adreno 320 inside the Oppo N1. Here the smartphone got 16 fps and 42 fps respectively, putting the Oppo N1 about on par with the Meizu MX3 and its Exynos 5 chipset. The GLBenchmark's 2.5 test gave the Oppo N1 a very promising result placing it above contenders like the Nexus 5 and well into Adreno 330 territory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel, an onscreen graphics test which accounts for the differences in screen resolution, also points to a fairly highly clocked Adreno 320 inside the Oppo N1, which matched its regional competitor Meizu MX3 exactly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to browsing performance, where SunSpider and BrowserMark 2 should give us an idea of the JavaScript and HMTL 5 performance of the Oppo N1. The phablet did reasonably well in both tests, suggesting that Oppo has done pretty well with the browser optimizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up the Oppo N1 does is a pretty decent performer, even if it won't win any benchmark titles. The good news is that in real world scenarios the Oppo N1 is fast and fluid there are no traces of lag when using it. The app loading times may be a tad better on the Snapdragon 800 handsets, but that's only noticeable if you do side-by-side test. Future proofing is an entirely different subject of course.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses a tabbed interface, not unlike the stock phonebook. The first tab is groups, then there's the contact list and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook itself is pretty standard, save for the custom paintjob. It shows an alphabetized list of visible contacts with an alphabet index on the right if you want to jump to a specific letter (regular search is available too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact's photo brings out Quick contacts - shortcuts for calling, texting, emailing a contact and a bit more (e.g. a Chrome shortcut to visit their web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. A star next to the contact's photo and name can be used to mark them as favorite and there are call and text shortcuts at the bottom. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Earlier, we said visible contacts because you can hide contacts with no phone numbers or contacts from specific groups (e.g. ones that were synced from a specific email service).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact syncing tools are very powerful - contacts can be moved or copied between phone storage and a Google account, they can be synced with an Exchange server or Facebook, and you can send / import contacts over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an Anti-harassment mode located in the contacts app, which is pretty powerful. You can put numbers in a blacklist, block messages and intercept spam calls. The strange thing is, you can't block people from the messaging or phone app - only in the contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer does smart dial (looking up both names and phone numbers). The button at the bottom left lets you quickly save the number you've typed in to a new or existing contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Holiday mode, in which only notifications and calls from a whitelist of users will get through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the call settings you can tweak a number of things. One is Notify on connect - the phone can vibrate or ring (or both) when a call connects. You can also build a list of texts to send when you decline a call. Flip to mute calls is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 scored a Very Good mark on our loudspeaker test. Pink noise was good but ringing and voice tones were very impressive - you won't miss calls with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Information on how we perform the test can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all conversations organized into threads, with a big New Message button at the bottom and a settings button next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each conversation consists of messages displayed in speech bubbles, similar to a chat program. It's a bit annoying that the compose box starts off as a single line, but it will grow to up to twelve as you type in more text. A character/message counter shows up when you're 10 letters away from the 140 limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Delivery reports can be activated and you can backup and import messages. You can't lock individual messages or message threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts is also included and supports SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen and supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an almost 6" screen on tap the Oppo N1 offers plenty of room for an ample keyboard. Keys are very big and become even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the wide screen is remarkably comfortable for two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has included an option to change the individual key height in both portrait and landscape, which isn't found that often. There are also themes to the keyboard which you can choose from. You can select to have arrow keys at the bottom of the keyboard but one thing we wished was included is a numpad above the QWERTY like you'd find on devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - it's much more convenient, especially at this screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing the device in landscape expands the keyboard immensely but leaves too little space for the text box above and we found ourselves never really using landscape as the portrait keyboard was spacious enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a "handle" attached to the text cursor - it's easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A double tap will bring up the select options - select word and select all - with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case of a typo, it will be underlined in red and when you tap it, the phone will offer a number of suggested corrections along with options to add the word to the phone's dictionary or just delete the word. The auto-suggest system will offer up the names of your contacts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's voice typing as well and lastly Fantasy test with a number of styles. It basically transforms text into a mix of letters, symbols and numbers but with a little bit of imagination is still readable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the Oppo N1 is a custom job, but surprisingly one with less features than the vanilla app. The default view is a grid of folders, with a name and number of images for each folder labeled underneath. You can hide folders you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't filter apps by location, time, people or tags like you would in the stock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images inside folders are arranged on a rectangular grid and you have two options - image selection mode and start a slideshow. You can select multiple images (folders too) and then Share and Delete options become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an individual image, you can swipe left and right to navigate between images. You can zoom out to a strip of images (3 on a screen), which makes browsing faster. There's also a Beauty mode, which is found in the camera (we'll look into it when the time comes) but it basically detects images with a face inside and lets you choose makeup, slimming down features, etc. The image detection is a little hit and miss and we'd sometimes get the Beauty option on an image without a face inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features here are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it delete it or get a menu with more functions. Those include rotation, cropping, renaming and viewing details. The details offer more info than most other galleries, including EXIF info (things like focal length, aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a more advanced editor too. Light adjustments let you bring out the shadows or the highlights, you can apply effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable file manager out of the box. Its interface is laid out over two tabs, the first one organizes files by category, while the second is a traditional folder browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be copied, moved, deleted, renamed and compressed to ZIP (and ZIP files can be extracted). Batch operations are supported. The folder browser has list and grid views and you can change the sorting method. The system can be encrypted and password protected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also has built in DLNA and FTP servers, which makes it easy to access multimedia and general files on another device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year Oppo has put a much simpler and inferior player. Gone is the Dolby Mobile enhancement or the Dirac HD one. There's not even an equalizer with presets or manual controls present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is pretty straightforward - your music library is organized into a local list of all music, favorites, artists, albums and folders. There's also an option to add a playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is split into two - the current playlist and the album art/music controls screen. You can swipe between the two. By default the player will look for lyrics and display them under the album art, which imitates a vinyl. You can add album art if it's not available (but the player won't look for it automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a playback mode button (normal, shuffle, repeat track) and a toggle for audio enhancement. That cycles through Off, Dolby and Dirac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the music player successfully played a 16-bit FLAC file (24-bit didn't work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is on the notification area lets you control the playback via an expandable notification but the lockscreen will not acknowledge playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music is preloaded on the Oppo Find 5 if you prefer that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 comes with a pretty simple-looking video player, which supports DivX, Xvid, Avi, MVK, MP4, etc. We had no issues playing files all the way up to 1080p resolution and had issues only once with an file with AAC sound codec - video was running with no sound. Others with using AAC played fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface for video selection is pretty basic too - a list of all available files. The player supports subtitles too, but there's only an on/off toggle here, you can't manually pick the subtitle file (so it would have to have the same name as the video file to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While watching a video you get a timeline scrubber, play/pause along with forward/back controls, a lock option (which locks the display against accidental touches) and a pop up toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that seems lifted right off the Samsung Galaxy flagships is the pop-up player. It's a small floating window that lets you have other apps working underneath. You can move it around to get it out of the way, but there's no resize option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 supports Wi-Fi display but you'd need a display with the standard's support to output video on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 turned out to be an excellent performer in terms of audio output quality. The phablet aced the first part of our test, posting excellent scores and garnishing them with the volume levels comparable to those of the HTC One Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones with distortion and stereo crosstalk both increasing a bit. It's not too bad though and neither is the drop in volume - the loudness is still above average. We'd still rate the overall performance as excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP rotating camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 camera has a 1/3.06" CMOS sensor of 13MP resolution. The lens has a bright F/2.0 aperture and a 6-element design. The Nokia Lumia 1020 has a 6-element lens as well but it's got a smaller F/2.2 aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 uses a custom image processor co-developed by Oppo and Fujitsu. Oppo is promising it has solved common camera problems like pink spots and purple fringing. And indeed, we didn't see any of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface has two control sidebars in the viewfinder, the right one holding the still and video buttons and gallery shortcut, while the left one is for settings, flash and scene selection. The standard way of accessing recently snapped photos - a left swipe - is available here too and you can swipe up to delete photos straight from from the viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the screen there's a little three dot toggle which will guide you through the different shooting modes - Beauty, Panorama, HDR and Normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also allows for longer than usual exposures - up to 8 seconds actually (the 1020 does only 4 seconds).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beauty mode will snap a photo of a person, preferably in portrait mode. The mode removes imperfections like skin lines, facial hair, etc. Then the app gives you various makeup options. It detects eyes and mouth but you can fine tune them if the app gets them wrong. It's more of a fun app than useful. Most results we got were a little over the top - as if deliberately created to be funny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1's camera captured nice photos although the levels of resolved detail are not stellar. The colors look accurate and contrast is also good but there's a lot of visible noise. On the positive side, it's only of the luminance type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also some images suffered from random soft spots, while others came out entirely blurry - so far we haven't been able to track the issue and the reason for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro shooting is good on the Oppo N1. It captured a lot of detail and blurred the background nicely to create a true macro feel to the image. Check out some full-res samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, we come to the Panorama shooting mode. Unfortunately, the Oppo N1 is really bad at capturing panoramas. Images have abysmal levels of detail and stitching artifacts are clearly visible all over the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a nice HDR mode on the Oppo N1. It snaps several shots of the same scene with different exposure settings and then combines them into a single image. Here are two samples in full-resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at a 100% crop from the Oppo N1's HDR samples, you can see the benefits of shooting this way. In this mode the smartphone clearly does a better job of exposing correctly the extreme tones (like the area of the sky and the darker places). Another good thing is that the HDR images come out natural without excessive tonal contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to low light photography. The Oppo N1 makes use of two LED flashes. What's interesting about them is that they never shoot simultaneously. Instead, one is a bright LED for regular shots (when the camera is pointed back), while the other has diffused properties. When you turn the camera beyond a certain angle, the phone switches automatically to the diffused one so your selfies turn out with a more pleasing skin tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did a little test in a low-lit room with the Oppo N1 to gauge its performance in such conditions. We're glad to say that low-light shots don't come with a big penalty in image quality, which is good news altogether. However,make sure you keep your hands steady after it gets dark, as there is no optical image stabilization on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We set up our dark scene. In Normal mode, the camera chose an ISO value of around 600 and an exposure time of 1/17 seconds. Switching to Night mode almost doubled the ISO to up to 900-1000 and hence the exposure time got shorter down to 1/33 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we shot the same scene with the Oppo N1 LED flash - the camera went back to what is obviously its slowest possible shutter speed of 1/17s, but this time the light was enough for an ISO below 300, producing a much cleaner and detailed image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put those results in perspective we tested the Oppo N1 against the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Note 3's results look smoother but actually carry less detail. But because of the noise-suppressing algorithm there's also less noise. We found the dual LEDs on the Oppo N1 to be a little stronger and to aid better and more natural-looking results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution samples of the Oppo N1's best normal, night and flash efforts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are those of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>   Oppo N1 in our photo compare test</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Subpar video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 is capable of 1080p video capture at 30 frames per second as well as 1080p high dynamic range video and slow-motion WVGA video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The normal mode of capture resulted in a video with average levels of detail and pleasant colors. The video produced a rather poor bitrate of around 9 Mbps. We guess if Oppo had increased the bitrate, the phone would have captured more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Framerate hovered around 27fps and the video was a little choppy at times while audio bitrate was 157 Kbps with 2 channels (read, stereo) and a 48 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR video shares the same credentials as the normal one but adjusts the exposure a little differently, resulting in a little less contrast in the scene. The level of captured detail is about the same, but the HDR video is again, a little choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there is the slow motion capture. Unlike the Galaxy Note 3, which captures slo-mo clips in 1280 x 720, the Oppo N1 can only go up to 800 x 480px (WVGA) but the perceived detail is a lot less than that. There's hardly anything sharp about these videos - check a sample below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find an untouched 1080p video sample (00:10s, 11.6 MB) for direct download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity sans LTE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 comes packed with connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM and penta-band HSPA support. There's dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, microUSB 2.0 with USB on the go support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Oppo N1 sadly lacks is LTE. We find it a little strange given its flagship aspirations and Snapdragon 600 chip but not every country out there basks in LTE glory yet so it may not be a deal breaker for everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One useful app here is the System update app, which can be used to update the phone's software over the air or from a local file (a ZIP saved in the internal memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Data monitor app preloaded on the Oppo N1, which scans how much data you've used through Wi-Fi and the carrier network you're using. The app can set limits for usage and also break down the used data by apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>O-Click is another cool connectivity option. It connects to the O-Click accessory through Bluetooth and lets the accessory help do various things. The O-Click accessory can be attached to your keychain or wrist and be used to detect when the Oppo N1 isn't withing connection distance from the O-Click, a double-tap on the tiny remote would invoke a sound notification on the Oppo N1 (even with sound turned off) and would alert you of incoming notifications on the Oppo N1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone itself can call the O-Click remote through the settings page for the accessory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 comes with Google Chrome as its solitary preinstalled browser. The interface hasn't changed since Chrome's launch for Android and is clean and minimalist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop buttons next to tabs and settings buttons. You can switch between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right of the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. You can also open up the tabs view by swiping down from the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous on settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi access, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's options, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, while Chrome excels in many areas, it falls short on the one that could be a deal-breaker for many of Android users and this is Flash. Sadly, viewing Flash content is the one thing you won't be able to do here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 comes with Kingsoft Office preinstalled. It's a pretty powerful office editor that can handle Word docs, PDFs, Spreadsheets and Presentations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can link to cloud storage, email files, create a shared view with other users and more. There's editing enabled too so you can get some work done on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has three views that you can swipe between. First is the Year view, which aggregates all 12 months with all of their days, a month view, which has little red dots for events and the agenda view, which is a vertically scrollable grid of events. Sadly year view doesn't show little dots for when there's an event, despite the screen being large and high-res enough to allow it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an event is pretty straight-forward - you just hit the New event toggle in month and agenda view and start choosing the name, if it's a birthday memo, dates and times, the time zone and you can add reminders. Behind a Show more options tab you'll find repeat, account to where you'd like to save the event , locations, availability info (busy, free, etc.) and privacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Google Calendar preinstalled on the Oppo N1 if you prefer a cleaner, simpler look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ring tone, volume, snooze interval and note. The app also offers a world clock, a stop watch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is pretty simple to use - it has big, easily thumbable keys. In order to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.) you just turn the app in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app lets you create complex notes with text, images and hand drawn notes. You can even set a password for your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tools folder is preloaded with a few apps that you usually get from the market. There's a Flashlight app (that's virtually similar to the HTC app), a sound recorder and a 3D compass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a backup and restore app, which does just that - it backs up your Oppo N1's data, settings and apps. You can schedule a backup, choose to backup multimedia files, etc. You can later restore your backup but you'll need to export it first as the app doesn't auto upload the backup to cloud services (like HTC's or Samsung's does).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The O-Cloud app looks like it can only backup your contacts, text messages and find your phone. There doesn't seem to be any real storage here or even a connection between the backup and restore app and the O-Cloud app. Perhaps it's a work in progress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the Oppo N1 has its organizing needs duly covered. However if you find yourself in need of another cloud storage options (Dropbox, Google Drive, Skydrive, etc.), office editing (QuickOffice, Google Drive, etc.), note taking app (Evernote, Springpad, etc.), etc. - you can get it more often than not for free from the Google Play store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 comes with a GPS receiver, which took little under a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has a somewhat easier to use interface for caching maps - you pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view and choose "Make available offline" from the search bar (after you've scrolled past search results or prompts). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 has access to the latest Google Play store. You get to your account, My Apps, My wishlist and parts of it through a side-swipable menu ala Google+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phablet space has certainly gone a long way in the past three years. From a virtually empty niche to one of the most hotly-contested segments of the market. The once mocked Samsung Galaxy Note lineup is now receiving the highest form of flattery, with just about every manufacturer pushing a direct rival.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the Oppo N1 isn't just another Galaxy Note 3 wannabe. The Chinese company was very keen on leaving a mark in the phablet game and the result is a device with plenty of character and innovation. For starters, the design and build are distinctly different from the competition and, one might argue, superior to most of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating camera, the rear touchpad, the O-Click remote aren't just novelties for their own sake - each of them contributes to the user experience in a meaningful way and shows that there's more than one way to create a good phablet. And it's not just the hardware either - the Oppo's proprietary Color OS has plenty going for it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Granted, the N1 might have benefited from a more capable chipset - not because it feels sluggish now, but because a great device certainly deserves more in terms of future-proofing. And the bezels could be slimmer - phablet user-friendliness is particularly dependent on that and the N1 certainly wastes more space than it should, particularly above and below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance, there's not a lot of wrong for a device that gets so many things right. But with the kind of competition that the N1 is facing, every mistake might cost you dearly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the first device that springs to mind when you think of phablets is the latest installment in the series that started it all. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 offers a tad smaller screen, but it's of the Super AMOLED variety. It's got a much faster chipset plus expandable storage. Add the S Pen and its ever-expanding functionality and the 4K video recording and it immediately becomes evident that the Oppo N1 will have a hard time prevailing in this battle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the N1's lower price, larger screen and a choice between two operating systems - Color OS and official CyanogenMod support mean not all is lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max also offers expandable storage and even throws in front-facing stereo speakers, but its camera is seriously underwhelming and its chipset isn't any better than that of the Oppo N1. Plus, the HTC phablet is seriously expensive at this point, so the Oppo N1 can easily be viewed as the better value option here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One Max</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the Sony Xperia Z Ultra, which offers an excellently fast Snapdragon 800 along with a 6.44" display as well as IP58 certification for water and dust resistance. The ample bezels make the Sony phablet particularly hard to carry around despite its marvelously slim waistline and its camera is pretty limited, so we find better balance in the N1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z Ultra</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 is the first foray into phablets for both maker and platform, but that doesn't mean it can't put up a proper fight. The 20MP PureView camera and the Snapdragon 800 chipset are some strong assets, but the limited choice of apps on Windows Phone and the high asking price make it a tough recommendation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 1520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the LG Optimus G Pro. The first device outside that Note lineup that dared climb to the phablet throne (before the Note III came around, anyway) has had a couple of price cuts and offers excellent value for money. The Optimus G Pro chipset is only marginally slower than the one inside the N1 and its screen, albeit a tad smaller, is equally impressive. Granted, the LG phablet is no match for the Oppo flagship in terms of looks, but its lower pricing and expandable storage may put a lot of pressure on the Chinese manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G Pro E985</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, at first glance the Oppo N1 finds itself in an unenviable position. It doesn't quite have enough to dethrone the Galaxy Note 3 in a direct battle so it will have to battle it out with the rest of the phablets for those disgruntled with TouchWiz. This means the arrival of CyanogenMod might be way more valuable for the N1 than expected. If the new Oppo flagship gets recognized as some sort of a Nexus of the phablet world, its prospects will soar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that the Oppo N1 can use to its advantage is the aggressive pricing that Chinese manufacturers have been known for. The phablet is currently on sale in China for CNY3,500, which is about $575 or ?420. If the price tag in Europe and America is close enough, it will be one of the bargains of the season. With no microSD card slot to allow cheap memory expansion, you'd probably need to go for the 32GB version though, which makes things trickier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day, the Oppo N1 might not sell tens of millions of units, but it does make a strong statement. It demonstrates that Oppo has ideas and the courage to see them through, and it's fully capable of materializing its out-of-the-box thinking. And that's a win of its own in our books.</paragraph>
