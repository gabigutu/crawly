			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe series often breathes fresh air into the stale smartphone design segment and the Lenovo Vibe Shot wants to serve double duty by trying to break into the difficult high-end smartphone photography market as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still fondly remember the Vibe X2 design and while the Vibe Shot is different, we think we'll remember it for a while too. It features a metal strip on the back to hold the camera and all its friends, which makes it look more like a compact camera than a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is indeed the main focus of the feature sheet. It has a 16:9 BSI sensor with 16MP resolution and optical image stabilization. It's augmented by a triple-LED flash and laser autofocus. You get a couple of hardware controls too - a two-stage shutter key, an Auto/Pro mode switch, the volume rocker turns into a zoom control to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Shot design is based on the aluminum frame and glass sandwich that rules the Android high class, but the camera strip on the back really breaks up the monotony. We especially like the Carmine Red version, which paints the metal frame in sports car red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its premium design, this Lenovo is a mid-ranger at heart. Its 1080p screen and Snapdragon 615 chipset put it in the same mid-premium segment that the HTC One A9, Moto X Play and others occupy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This mid-premium segment came to be mainly because people want a device that looks and feels premium, but the new features each year's flagships bring have become even more far-fetched. Will you ever use those features? Perhaps, perhaps not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not to say the Lenovo Vibe Shot doesn't have premium features. The camera comes fully-loaded for photos (not so much for videos), the storage is fairly generous (the competition comes with 16GB as base or no microSD slot) and we were wowed by the screen as soon as we powered it on. It's just that the gimmicks are out (and some genuinely useful functionality along with them, unfortunately).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the deal with Lenovo phones - their popularity is quite regional. Either you've never seen one or they are quite popular where you live. Can this one spur a more global adoption? Or at least further raise the popularity of Lenovo handsets? Let's crack open the box and find out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Lenovo Vibe Shot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Shot comes in a compact, well-designed box. The attractive package doesn't offer all that much - a small 1.5A charger, a flat microUSB cable and a card tray ejector tool. There are no headphones here, though. The retail package might be different in other regional versions. We suspect we're reviewing a grey import brought in directly from China.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe Shot 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot measures 142 x 70 x 7.3 mm, not the most compact 5" phone around. The black glass bezel around the screen isn't very thin to begin with, but the metal frame protrudes further than that. The space above and below the screen is not minimal either, at least below the screen there are capacitive touch buttons to make it a functional space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you first meet the Lenovo Vibe Shot you'll hear about two things - the design and the camera. In fact, the camera is the most attractive design element on the Shot. The metal frame and glass sandwich have become wildly popular in Android-land even though it's old news for iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal frame doesn't reach all the way to the front, meaning the glass frame protrudes from it and forms a second ledge. This makes it easier to hold the phone (since your thumb rests on the metal frame), but the two sharp edges may not be the most pleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front and back are panels of Gorilla Glass 3, all black. A brushed metal strip on the back decorates the camera and adds the characteristic digicam look at the rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The strip, though, is behind the back glass panel so the back feels smooth throughout. The camera (essentially flush with the back), plus the triple-flash and laser autofocus light add more to the attractiveness of its looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is much cleaner, only the capacitive keys below the screen break up the sleek black look. The bezels around the screen are anything but thin, the Vibe Shot is one of the bigger 5" phones. The default black theme and the great black levels of the screen work so well together that at first glance, you might be misled to believe you are looking at an AMOLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, above the screen is the 8MP/1080p selfie camera and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front and back are all-white on the Pearl White version of the phone and black on the Graphite Grey and Carmine Red. The latter color option has the metal strip around the edge in bold red color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Shot right side is where all the hardware buttons are - starting with the volume rocker, going down to the power button, then the Auto/Pro camera toggle and finally the two-stage shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side houses the two card trays - the top one holds two microSIM cards, the bottom one is for a microSD card. That's good news in the wake of hybrid slots that give you an "either-or" choice between dual-SIM and expanded storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom houses an old-school microUSB 2.0 port (the Lenovo-backed ZUK Z1 had USB Type-C, but not the Vibe Shot), two grills (only one of which covers a speaker) and even a lanyard eyelet (a rare sight).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is the plainest, holding only the 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot has one of the most memorable designs we've seen in a while, even if it goes for the common metal frame, glass sandwich formula. We wish it was more compact, but it looks - and feels - great in the hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot comes with an impressive IPS LCD. It's not impressive for its size or resolution - 5" 1080p is pretty common in the midrange - but the image quality is better than expected. The colors pop, the contrast is huge, viewing angles are as wide as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We actually had to double-check that it's not an AMOLED unit. The reason is the surprisingly high contrast - we measured it at over 1,700:1. At maximum brightness whites topped 500nits while the black levels remained pleasingly low. Bringing the brightness slider lower makes for even darker blacks though the contrast becomes slightly lower (still an excellent 1,300:1 at 50% brightness).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum brightness level can go even higher (629nits) in the Super bright mode, which however should be activated manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default color setup isn't very accurate (with an average deltaE of 5.6) and even our best attempts of tweaking the available screen temperature controls didn't get it perfect, though we achieved a much better average deltaE of 3.9 with a warmer setting than the default and this sort of a result is almost perfect. This improvement in color rendition, however, comes at the expense of a hit in the maximum brightness (470nits).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At any rate, the colors are rich and the high contrast makes viewing photos on the Vibe Shot screen a pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high contrast and high maximum brightness brought the sunlight legibility to an excellent 3.1, which is Super AMOLED or iPhone territory. Great job, Lenovo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, you can tweak the default image settings, you can manually adjust the tone (cool-warm) and the saturation (pastel-bright). Comfort mode strongly reduces blue light to help you sleep while Super bright mode to help visibility. Smart brightness detects bright light environments and gives the screen an extra push.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super bright mode boosts the white brightness to 630nits though the contrast dips to around 1,300:1 again. Still, on very sunny days this mode can help you get a much clearer picture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot is a dual-SIM phone with dual-standby. The chipset supports 4G LTE up to Cat. 4 (150Mbps down, 50Mbps up) and 3G HSPA+ (42Mpbs down, 5.76Mbps up). The microSIM cards have their own tray, so you don't have to go without a microSD card should you choose to use two SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locally, you have dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (no 802.11ac) and Bluetooth 4.1 with A2DP. There's no NFC though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB On-The-Go, so you can plug in USB gadgets. Many thumb drives already come with a microUSB plug on one end. There's no word on wired TV-out, but Google's Cast protocol is fully supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot packs a 3,000mAh Li-Po battery that is sealed inside the chassis. That capacity is pretty good for the 5" class and the modern Snapdragon 615 chipset should offer good performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Shot has extensive power-saving features. The basic battery saver can turn on automatically at 15% or 5%, you can also limit which apps are allowed to run in the background. Then there's the Ultimate Power Saver mode, which is even stricter and can be enabled for a given time period (e.g. overnight).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option allows you to limit the power consumption of the screen and the GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final score, however, isn't that great - the Vibe Shot managed 54 hour endurance rating with one SIM and 52h with both SIM slots occupied. The big issue proved to be the video playback - it stopped short of 6 hours, which is quite low. The 8 hour web browsing time is good (though behind the leaders), same goes for the 16 hour talk time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android 5.1, the Vibe way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like other Lenovo phones, the Vibe Shot comes with a heavily customized version of Android called Vibe OS. This one is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop (the K3 Note we reviewed in October used 5.0 as a base). This fact puts it a step behind the phones with fast track updating, but Lenovo prioritizes its custom features over the things Google provides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with other devices hailing from the East, the Vibe Shot exhibits the style popular in the region - that is, no app drawer (every shortcut goes on the homescreen, mixed in with the widgets), a rich app package out of the box and certain quirks (e.g. the RAM cleaning button that's more placebo than useful).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you first boot up the phone, it asks you to set up some secure unlock - PIN or Pattern - but you can disable that afterward if you like. There's no fingerprint reader here, though. Double-tap-to-wake is available though it's disabled by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One interesting security feature is called Secure Zone - it allows you to create two virtual "zones," for example to keep your work and private life separate. Each zone can have its own selection of apps, accounts, and passwords. If a notification arrives in the currently inactive zone, it will show up with a red dot in the status bar. You need to switch zones to be able to view it (which means others can't without your permission, even if they have your phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo goes a step further - your data is protected even from the apps themselves. App data and documents are kept separate between the zones though there's an OpenUserData folder that can be accessed from both zones. Data in the Secure Zone can only be accessed by Secure Zone apps. Call logs and messages are shared between the zones so that normal phone operation is unaffected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vibe OS features multi-user support and the guest account can be blocked from making calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the user interface is fully themeable. The default theme features minimalistic, colorful icons but there are several others pre-installed, even one called "Less is more" if you long for Material Design flatness. You can change individual Wallpapers, Lockscreen, and Sounds and can even switch between the Lenovo and the Lollipop app switcher styles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo option is more iOS than Android, featuring a horizontal row of thumbnails (3 in total). The other option, dubbed "Android L," shows a 3D Rolodex of thumbnails that just barely shows a fourth app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pretty standard Android - pull once for notifications, pull again for quick toggles. You can re-arrange toggles (including adding and removing some) and the screen brightness slider has an "Auto" toggle. You can even adjust the number of columns in which the toggles are arranged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The customization options of the status bar and notification center go deeper still, so power users can tweak things just the way they like them. An interesting addition is a button that opens the notification log - all notifications, even ones dismissed days ago are there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One tool to help one-handed use and multitasking is Wide touch. The name is rather non-descriptive, but what you get is a small, translucent button on the screen that opens a window of shortcuts when tapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While not Marshmallow, the OS has a Permission Control center. It's disabled by default, but when you toggle it on you can browse what permission each app requires and which permissions are required by which apps. You can disable them individually or set to "Always ask." This functionality has been tried in Android for a while, but it took a very long time for Google to pull the trigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One other non-standard feature is the Default write disk. This allows you to use the microSD as if it was the internal storage, including installing apps there. On stock Android, even writing regular files has become a chore so this is nice to see. In a few years, a fast, big microSD can replace the aging internal storage with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we're not thrilled about is that of the 32GB total storage, 6.6GB is occupied out of the box with some more going to the pre-installed apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot is based on the Snapdragon 615, the mid-range chipset that boasts an octa-core processor though its Adreno 405 GPU is not the ideal choice for 3D gaming on a 1080p screen. Still, the chipset is one of Qualcomm's more popular, especially in the sub-flagship range. The phone does come with 3GB of RAM, though, which is rare in this segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II 2.0 shows the Vibe Shot performs on the upper scale of the S615 stable, though MediaTek's popular Helio X10 pulls ahead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single-core performance is similarly strong, showing that the Cortex-A53 is no slouch despite its low-power nature. Clock speed helps, though, allowing the Meizu MX5 (Helio X10) to pull ahead though the difference isn't as big as the difference in clock speed between 2.2GHz and 1.7GHz suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi-core speed surprisingly isn't that great, according to Basemark OS II 2.0. Even Geekbench 3.0 shows a middle of the road performance, here Helio's superior clock speed makes an impact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 405 GPU supports OpenGL ES 3.0, so it can run most recent games, though, bleeding-edge games that use ES 3.1 are a no-go. The GPU itself doesn't have enough muscle for high-end gaming at full 1080p resolution, though. You shouldn't experience difficulties with casual games, but if you're the type to put all game settings on "Max" the chipset isn't up to the task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot does about as well as can be expected from the S615 herd, HTC has managed to squeeze out slightly more out of this hardware on the A9. Perhaps the relatively clean Android 6.0 Marshmallow has helped in this respect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot performs well within the capabilities of its chosen hardware though it would have benefited from a leaner, cleaner Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking is breezy with 3GB of RAM, we didn't encounter issues with apps or browser tabs reloading. Most S615-based competitors tie up the 3GB of RAM option (if they have it at all) with the purchase of their pricier 32GB version, so it's nice we have it on a 16 gig model as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot is a dual-SIM phone with dual-standby and the good news is that neither SIM takes up the spot of the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer has the Yellow Page feature, which finds the location and phone number of local businesses - hotels, restaurants and so on. It really speeds up the process of calling in a reservation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single loudspeaker on the Lenovo Vibe Shot scored an Average mark, beating the iPhone 6s and Xperia Z5 (and its dual-speakers). We've heard louder individual speakers, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable Pocket mode, which uses the proximity sensor to detect when the phone is in your pocket and it boosts the loudspeaker volume temporarily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Shot came with the standard Google Keyboard. It offers autocorrecting and gesture typing and you can pick different themes - dark and light in Material or Holo flavor. The option to adjust the height of the keyboard is not available, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot comes with a richer app package than a Nexus would, though some of those apps provide functionality not present on stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SYNCit is one, it allows you to backup Contacts, SMS and Call log to the Lenovo cloud. If you don't want to set up an account, you can backup to the SD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>CLONEit is similar though not technically pre-installed - the shortcut is there, but you still have to download the full app from the Play Store. Anyway, install the same app on another phone and you will be able to clone your contact, SMS and other data between the phones (useful when switching phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File browser makes it easy to find files of a specific type (e.g. documents or photos), it will even handle ZIPs. Of course, you can browse the full folder structure of both the internal storage and the microSD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy feature lets you wirelessly manage your files through your computer browser (as long as both are connected to the same network). This functionality is based on SwiFTP also available on the Play Store as FTP Server. It's better to use a proper FTP app, though, the browser offers only limited functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already covered some of the custom features on the Vibe Shot, but there are some really powerful automation tools. For example, you can set the phone to automatically power off at night and power back on in the morning. This will put an end to late night calls and won't waste battery for standby as you sleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Smart scene feature. You can set up triggers - time, Wi-Fi, your class schedule - and have several actions performed automatically. Lenovo has already set up some useful scenes, like School, Office, Lunch, Meeting and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A simple gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo gallery is as simple as they come. It has two view modes - Album (that is folders) and Time. Thanks to the Cast screen option in the notification area you can easily throw your photos up on a large (Cast-compatible) screen. The slideshow option is also a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you get basic editing tools - crop, rotate, plus some color effects and borders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can try spreading your photos with the SHAREit app though that requires the receiving device to have a copy of the app. On the plus side, it can cooperate with iOS and Windows Phone devices, Windows PCs too, on the downside basically none of them have SHAREit installed. The Vibe Shot lacks NFC so the regular tap to share of Android Beam doesn't work either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video app knows three ways of ordering your videos - Intelligent, Date or Name. We found no explanation of just how the Intelligent mode works, but you can always fall back on the search feature if all else fails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player UI lets you create playlists for binge watching and you can easily snap a screenshot from the video. There's also a pop-up play mode, which lets you focus on something else while half paying attention to the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video format support is a little spotty - AVI, MP4 and MKV files should work, but the player is picky when it comes to codecs. AVC works most of the time (though one video stuttered a bit), however, the modern HEVC standard is out. The chipset has hardware support for HEVC decoding, so if you have such files you can head to the Play Store for a third-party player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio in AC3, DTS or FLAC format fail too, the safe bet is MP3 or AAC. There is no subtitle support either. Again, these issues are fixable by using a different app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music and FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo did not provide a custom music player (surprising since the K3 Note had one), but Play Music does a fine job. It lets you tap into Google's online music library - for streaming or for purchase - but it's just as home at playing songs stored on your phone. Indeed, you can browse only offline files if you want to avoid the distraction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5-band equalizer is available with a number of presets (and a manual option), plus Bass boost and Surround sound (only if you have headphones plugged in).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Tools folder you'll find the Radio app. It can play through headphones or the loudspeaker (but you still need the headphones). The app also features broadcast recording (this may be regionally limited). There's no RDS, though, so you don't get the station names automatically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is only decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot showed good clarity in the first part of our audio quality test. When attached to an active external amplifier, the smartphone produced great scores, save for the shaky frequency response. It was also let down by its below average loudness, but we still give it a good mark here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones and you get some extra intermodulation distortion. The stereo crosstalk climbs up an average amount while the volume remains disappointing. Overall, it's a poor showing here, although it should be enough to please less demanding users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot lives up to its name with a 16MP camera that packs OIS, laser autofocus, and triple-LED flash. There's a two-stage shutter key, a volume rocker than can double as a zoom lever and even a hardware switch to toggle between Auto and Pro mode. The first relies on the camera's automatic smarts to produce a good image, the latter leans on yours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor is a 16:9 BSI unit behind a f/2.2 lens. In Pro mode, you can control exposure, ISO (100-1,600), shutter speed (1/15s-1s), focus and white balance. The camera doesn't capture RAW files, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Auto mode, you get some helpful tools like Tri-axial leveling (a virtual spirit level). Smart composition tries to be even more clever - it recognizes the scene and directs you on how to frame it. For example, if your human subject looks to the left, it's best to put them in the right side of the frame. This feature also handles landscapes and food shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A less sci-fi like AI feature is the Smart mode, which is like Sony's Superior auto - it guesses the scene and engages the best settings for it. This way you get HDR or low-light mode automatically. Good thing too, since there's no manual way to enable them. For that, you would have to switch to Auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just one of the issues we have with Vibe's UI. The other is that commonly used camera modes like Panorama are hidden in the Pro mode (even though they are fully automatic). Also, switching to Panorama in Pro mode and then flipping the hardware switch to Auto doesn't exit the Panorama mode (or Artistic HDR, or Blur background, ...), you have to do that manually. It's not the most useful switch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP photos show a lot of resolved detail though it has to compete with relatively strong noise and it doesn't always win. The dynamic range of the camera isn't great so highlights are often blown out, with little detail in the shadows too. Color rendering is accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode (enabled by Smart mode or manually in Pro) slightly improves photos in the shadowy areas, but not by much. It really slows down shot-to-shot time too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama mode produces images around 1,800px in height, even though it uses the long side of the 5,328 x 2,997px sensor (the mode works only in portrait). The quality of the stitching is good, but the resolved detail is noticeably less than still photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the triple-LED flash in a fully dark room against one of the best in the biz - the Nexus 5X. The flash is quite powerful though it helps that the FoV isn't as wide as the Nexus. The tri-color flash helps the Vibe Shot produce a more pleasing (if not perfectly accurate) white balance - it goes for warm while the Nexus went for cool colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of detail, the excellent sensor of the 5X allowed it to pull ahead, but the Lenovo resolved plenty of detail too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A note on the autofocus - it's quite slow in low light. The Laser autofocus really only works for close-ups (~40cm or 1ft) and beyond that you are left with slow focus hunting. This was the worst in video mode where the phone started with a proper focus and refocused into a blurry mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie camera boasts 8MP/1080p capabilities and in Pro mode, it has a Wide selfie feature (something borrowed from Samsung). It's like a panorama for your selfies, allowing you to make wide group shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use our updated Photo quality comparison tool to see how the Lenovo Vibe Shot measures up against the 16MP competition in both good and low lighting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Lenovo Vibe Shot in the photo quality compare tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera benefits from the high-res, widescreen sensor and OIS, but the Snapdragon 615 chipset locks it into a 1080p @ 30fps world. There's no 4K, no 60fps, no slow-motion. For a phone this focused on camera it's a little disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are recorded into MP4 files at 20Mbps bitrate (higher than average) with stereo audio at 96Kbps (that's less than ideal). You can drop to 720p resolution if you want to save on some storage, but that's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's no manual mode for video - you can't adjust image settings or control the focus. There isn't even tap to focus after recording starts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is less impressive than the photo quality, it's not that great even if we limit our selection to 1080p-capable phones. The contrast comes on too strong and the image is clearly over-sharpened, without a ton of detail to show for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the image appears shaky at first and then each time the camera refocuses. Sometimes it takes it several full seconds to get a stable lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download this sample to view the untouched quality - 1080p @ 30fps (12s, 29.3MB). It's not the YouTube compression that's the problem though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe Shot key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality worth of an Android flagship, though we get more bezel than we bargained for;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excellent display: one of the best LCDs we've seen, bright and easy to read. Color accuracy can be good with a bit of tweaking;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life not that great with an Endurance rating of 54 hours (the video player spoils the overall performance);</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Solid connectivity with dual-SIM and LTE; the second SIM doesn't live in the microSD slot unlike hybrid slots on other phones;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some Marshmallow features were ported to the Android 5.1 Lollipop base; the Secure Zone feature helps keep work and personal life separate; a fingerprint reader would have been nice to keep equipment riding the wave;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great performance for the class (3GB of RAM helps); a less loaded Android would have helped too;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no music player other than Google Play Music, the video player is too basic; the FM radio is nice but lacks RDS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio output quality is good with an external amplifier but far from it with the headphones plugged in;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good quality 16MP shots, but the UI can use some work; triple-flash makes for excellent low-light shots, but the autofocus is sluggish in low light;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is not as good as that of the still camera, and that's without counting the lack of 4K and 60fps modes against it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Several years ago the attractive design was just about the only standout feature of a mobile phone for the lack of other notable features. Today, the tables have turned. The features are numerous but the designs have become so plain that a good design, which is rich in character, can easily stick out. As if consumers have almost had their fill of advanced features and they are after that elusive combination of looks and functionality that few phones can deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot brings a much-needed shot of innovation on that front and is one of the best-looking phones we've handled this year. But Lenovo's ambitions stretched further than nailing design - they wanted to excel at the key selling point for many smartphones - the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This dictated both the theme of the design of the phone (a point &amp; shoot camera) and the feature list too. The camera comes fully loaded with a high-resolution sensor, optical stabilization, and triple-flash, plus an actual hardware switch to give you manual control over the camera (plus plenty of intelligence for the Auto mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other side of the lens is an excellent display - a 5" LCD that can rival flagships in image quality. Sure, it's not QHD-sharp, but at this size, it makes very little difference. And the Vibe Shot isn't a flagship - it's priced as a premium mid-ranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the class that flies above the usual rabble of the mid-range and offers a mix of high-end features without the elite price. Here's the rundown of the features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen and build quality of the Vibe Shot are definitely top-level stuff, the still camera could use some polish (and the video camera is just ordinary). The memory situation is surprisingly good - you get 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage as a base. And the microSD card gets a dedicated slot, so dual-SIM users don't have to choose between a microSD card and a second SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software is a mixed bag, literally. The Vibe OS is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop but brings many features typically reserved for 6.0 Marshmallow. The software package is pretty good out of the box though you'll probably want to replace the multimedia apps right away. The preloaded apps also eat quite a bit of the storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Lenovo Vibe Shot uses the metal frame/glass sandwich combo, the Huawei Honor 7 goes full metal. It brings a slightly bigger screen (5.2") with pretty excellent quality and the chipset beats the S615 on graphics performance. The camera sports a 20MP sensor with phase detection autofocus (no OIS though) and it too tops out at 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini swaps out the back glass pane of the big Z9 for more practical plastic. It's not particularly "mini" either with its 5" 1080p screen. The camera has a 16MP 16:9 sensor too though without much hardware add-ons (it does have manual controls though). The Snapdragon 615 chipset once again puts the upper limit of video at 1080p. Keep in mind that this is the most affordable phone on the list, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Z series get the most attention, but this year the Xperia M5 won over a lot of fans. A waterproof phone (IP68) with a 21MP camera (with phase detection AF and hardware shutter key), what's not to love? Don't forget the 13MP selfie cam. The MediaTek Helio X10 chipset speeds ahead of the S615 and the M5 is on track for a Marshmallow update. The build quality is solid though not as premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YU Yutopia (due to launch any moment now) sits closer to the flagships than the others on this list. It has a 5.2" QHD screen, a Snapdragon 810 chipset and a 21MP camera with OIS, phase-detection AF, even 2160p video capture. Note that YU is regionally-limited when it comes to distribution and the Yutopia is not their cheapest model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One ME is a bit pricier too, but that buys you a 5.2" QHD screen, stereo speakers and a chipset that can do 2160p (Helio X10 like the Xperia M5). The 20MP camera skips the OIS, but most M8/M9 models don't have it either. The One ME does have their cool dual-tone exterior, though and a ticket for the Android Marshmallow ride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite being huge in the PC market, Lenovo phones have pockets of popularity in some countries but not global appeal. The Vibe Shot will certainly raise Lenovo's profile where it already has a foothold. Can it break into the international market, though? Perhaps few will bother to import one, but those who do will get a kick ass screen and a capable camera too.</paragraph>
