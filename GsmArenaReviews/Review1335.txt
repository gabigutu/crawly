			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A huge high-res screen, a new chipset expected to deliver beyond anyone's wildest hopes and 1080p video recording: the LG Optimus 3D sounds like a great package and we haven't even started yet. These are big ones no doubt, but not even close enough to making the headline. Not with a stereoscopic screen and a couple of 3D video-recording cameras at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D is flagship stuff, head to toe. A premium package that doesn't need anything else to be complete. But whether it asked for it or not, the LG Optimus 3D might turn out to be the device of the season, on the shortlist of any self-respecting geek. Just look at those specs and you'll see what we mean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This preview is based on a pre-production Optimus 3D unit and the functionality, software and performance could possibly differ in the final retail units.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus 3D at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>2010 was a year of disappointment for the LG mobile division, but they're looking to turn things around in 2011. Having beaten all the competition to bring the first dual-core smartphone to the market, LG is now racing to get to the 3D checkpoint ahead of HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the really cool part is that LG didn't rush through the rest of the development in favor of the stereoscopic screen and imaging on the Optimus 3D. Quite the opposite, the phone is touted as the first to feature dual-channel memory, thanks to the brand new TI OMAP 4430 chipset. The only sour note is Froyo. LG are obviously taking their time with Gingerbread and we're yet to see a single phone of theirs running it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest does sound promising though and we cannot wait to see the 3D droid in action. So, without wasting any more time, the hardware inspection is due right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its entirely plastic construction, the LG Optimus 3D is a pretty good-looking handset. The front is a well-done mix of faux brushed metal (the two plastic pieces at the top and bottom), touch-sensitive keys and an ample LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has the LG?s trademark styling with a metal stripe on soft rubbery plastic. We liked that back in the Optimus 2X and a few months later we're glad to report we haven't tired of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If anything takes away some points from the Optimus 3D design, it'd be the thickness. Now, we realize it's probably impossible to squeeze all that functionality (including two cameras and a stereoscopic screen) in a anything slimmer so we are not blaming LG here. However, the fact remains that, when placed next to one of its slimmer competitors, the Optimus 3D loses some of its appeal. It simply looks chubbier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The increased thickness also has a slightly negative effect on handling. It's harder to wrap your hand around the Optimus 3D and have the entire surface of the screen within comfortable reach. It's not too bad though, and the result is most probably worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might be the right place to mention that the LG Optimus 3D is also a pretty heavy device. At 168 grams, it weighs a mere gram less than the Motorola Milestone 2 with its metal body and QWERTY keyboard. While the extra weight gives a certain solidity that many will appreciate, it's also certain to turn off those users who don't like carrying this much bulk around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A pretty good display that also does 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 4.3" stereoscopic LCD screen of WVGA resolution is the key feature of the LG Optimus 3D. The LG engineers have come a long way since we first met the handset back in Barcelona and the screen has been improved significantly as far as regular 2D viewing is concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point of its development, the Optimus 3D screen has very decent viewing angles, and so are the brightness and contrast. And no, when used as a regular 2D screen, the Optimus 3D display won't rival the Super AMOLED Plus blacks or the Retina display's sunlight legibility, but none of them does goggle-free 3D, do they?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The goal of the Optimus 3D display here was to trail the leaders closely and be ready to catch up and even overtake them by playing the trump card. Now the question remains how much is the stereoscopic ace worth to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D mode only works in landscape mode and the glasses-free viewing relies on a parallax-barrier technology. It's an extra screen layer that makes sure each eye sees a different set of pixels, giving a sense of depth. On the downside, each eye gets only half of the screen horizontal resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, to be able to enjoy it fully you will need to find the sweet spot between your eyes and the handset's screen, which is different for everyone. It might seem a bit of a nuisance at first, but you quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing that you have to get used to is there?s no way to share the 3D goodness of the screen. Only one person at a time can watch the 3D effect. Looking at the screen at an angle, gets you a regular 2D image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the 3D visualization is only available in applications that are specially designed for 3D viewing, but those are in no short supply on the Optimus 3D (we'll get back to them later). The regular Android interface looks just like on any other smartphone, you?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, given it's the first attempt we've seen at a mobile glasses-free 3D screen for mass sonsumption, the Optimus 3D display does pretty well. We were pleasantly surprised and we believe the technology has a future in smartphones. Or at least the potential is there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Getting around the device<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that we?ve taken the 3D screen out of the way, we can continue our tour of the LG Optimus 3D externals. Just above the display, you can notice a video-call camera, right next to the proximity sensor and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four capacitive keys are on the opposite end of the front. The Menu, Home, Back and Search keys are haptic enabled and brilliantly backlit, and have the usual Android functionality upon a long press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the LG Optimus 3D hosts the HDMI and microUSB ports, neatly covered by plastic caps. The lids might get in the way a bit, but it's a price you have to pay for keeping dust and moist away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated 3D key is on the opposite side of the smartphone, exactly on the spot usually reserved for a shutter key. The volume rocker is on that same side too. Both keys are a bit too flat and placed on the sloping rear half of the phone so pressing them is a bit tricky, but you do get used to it eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D key launches the 3D interface that LG cooked up for their latest smartphone. It also makes a point in a way that this particular part of the UI is quite important to LG (you know, like a mini-banner).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We move on to the top of the LG Optimus 3D, where the power/screen lock key is located. There's also a microphone (the smartphone records videos with stereo sound) and a 3.5mm audio jack there. The power key has the same problem as the volume rocker and the 3D knob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other microphone is located at the bottom of the device. Naturally, this is the one that is used when you make phone calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we turn the LG Optimus 3D around to meet the dual 5 megapixel camera lens combo with a tiny LED flash squeezed in between. The loudspeaker grill is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Optimus 3D seems pretty great. The smartphone seems sturdy and its exterior durable enough to last for quite some time without losing much of its appeal. A big and heavy phone, not particularly slim either, it does look impressive and handles reasonably well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3D apps aside, the user experience that the LG Optimus 3D offers is hardly any different from what you'd get from the Optimus 2X. Still we'll go through the LG home-backed launcher in case you missed that review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sad part is that the LG smartphone portfolio is still stuck with Android 2.2 Froyo, despite the fact that 2.3 Gingerbread has been available for more than six months now. Now since Android 2.3 Gingerbread is not such a dramatic improvement we are willing to let it go for now as long as LG promises to step up its game and deliver the update quickly (minor or not it's always better to have the update).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s now a view mode similar to the HTC Sense leap view, where you see all your homescreen panes in one place and pressing one of them zooms in on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This view mode is triggered by the familiar pinch zoom gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available number of homescreen panes can be customized too from that view mode with any number between 1 and 7. A set default button lets you select any of your homescreen panes as the default one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the LG Optimus 2X screen and are visible on both the homescreen and in the app drawer. You get phone, contacts, messaging and a home/applications button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG customizations continue with the app drawer. You get not one but three different options for its styling ? a side scrollable horizontal grid, a vertical grid that you scroll upwards and downwards and List view. In vertical grid mode you get icons grouped by categories, which you are free to change however you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the Android strong points, has a few tweaks as well ? it?s got five switches that toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and auto screen rotation. There are also music player controls docked here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough though, the gesture controls we saw on the LG Optimus 2X were missing from our pre-release Optimus 3D. As turn-to-mute and turn-to snooze were still present, there's still hope that they can make it in time for the release though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance seemed pretty good to us even at those stages of the Optimus 3D development. There's no denying that the Optimus 3D oozes with calculating power so things are looking good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now we move on to what you really came for - the 3D Space app, which is the hub for all the stereoscopic action on the Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>3D space is where it gets exciting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you didn't figure it out from the name than you should know that 3D is very important for the LG Optimus 3D. That's why the company developed the 3D space app, which brings the shortcuts to all the stereoscopic apps to a common hub and makes it all easier to access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's more the 3D space itself has a cool 3D interface with nice animations for each of the categories. Unfortunately there's no easy way to demonstrate 3D action going on with our camera, but here's what we came up with. Here's some animated GIF magic to give you a basic idea of the 3D effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, there's no need to shake your device furiously to get the 3D thing going. We are just giving you quickly alternating images that represent what each of your eyes is seeing when looking at the Optimus 3D screen. By changing them fast enough an impression of volume is created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here's the content of the 3D package that you are getting with the Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D guide<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not so much an app by itself, but more of a manual the 3D guide will teach you how to create, view and share 3D content. You get a brief tutorial on each of the subjects, but it should be enough to teach you everything there is to know about 3D on the handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>YouTube 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just as it sounds the YouTube 3D app is exactly the same thing as the regular YouTube Android app, except that it directly hooks up to YouTube?s 3D channel that?s full of good and not so good 3D content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Offering a couple of cool interface modes, the 3D gallery lets you browse your stereoscopic images and videos. It?s not particularly functional, but it's certainly good looking and smoothly running. In fact, truth be told, it?s there for the show-off. Besides that, it?s a pain to navigate, especially since there?s no way of sorting the content by date or type or anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option when looking at a single image, is to choose the depth of the 3D effect. We didn't see the need to move it from its default maximum position but you can reduce it if you feel like it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At number four comes the 3D camera, which allows you to actually capture 3D content instead of just consuming it. You can either do 3 megapixel stereoscopic snaps or 720p 3D videos. The image feeds from both cameras get cropped partly when shooting in 3D mode, and that?s the reason why the resulting pics are only 3MP as opposed to 5MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is standard LG stuff, but you do get the viewfinder in 3D too, which is pretty cool. On the other hand it makes shooting a bit trickier as you need to hold the camera at the sweet spot distance to see what you are shooting properly. Otherwise, all you get is a blurry mess and a headache.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come some samples from the LG Optimus 3D camera. Just have in mind that they were all created with our pre-release unit and the quality of the images and videos created with the retail version of the device will probably be better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check them out right from your Flash-enabled browser in our 3D Photo viewer by clicking the image below. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should use the Wiggle view mode (available as a switch below the images) to get a basic idea of the 3D effect without the need for glasses or a 3D screen. If you happen to have any of the supported anaglyph glasses (red/cyan or blue/yellow) at hand you might want to pick the C_Ana (colorful anaglyph), H_Ana (Half-color anaglyph) or BY_Ana (Blue-yellow anaglyph) view modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you may wish to download the jps files on your PC and open them with any JPS viewer that you want. Those are the untouched 3MP camera samples straight from the LG Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Photo 1,  Photo 2,  Photo 3,  Photo 4,  Photo 5,  Photo 6,  Photo 7,  Photo 8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a 720p 3D sample. Again, if you have a pair of red/cyan glasses you would be able to watch it in real 3D (though with somewhat poor colors). On a 3D monitor, the clips really come to life with full, proper colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D games and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3D games and apps complete the tally. In fact our unit only had four 3D games and no other apps optimized to take advantage of its screen, but we are sure more will come in in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The titles in question are Lets Golf 2, Nova, Asphalt 6 and Guiliver's Travels so there should be something for everyone. Much like the gallery, each of the games has a toggle to set the depth of the 3D effect and you can even get rid of it all together if you feel like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a pretty complete package if you think about it, though some more augmented reality apps (like the upcoming reality browser) and games would make an already sweet deal even better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Seriously powerful and having that one stand-out feature, the LG Optimus 3D certainly is a smartphone worth a second look. What's even better is that all the stereoscopic stuff actually works out fine so 3D fans won't regret their purchase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And for the rest, this smartphone is capable of haunting geeks dreams even if you take the 3D coolness away (and let's be honest - no one's forcing you to use it). The only problem is that LG are still dragging their feet about updating its smartphone portfolio to Gingerbread. Even with Froyo though, the Optimus 3D offers a solid enough smartphone experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, it all boils down to the importance of 3D for you. If you must have it (and take our word, it's the ultimate show-off feature to get), you probably won't regret sacrificing an AMOLED screen or the goodies brought by Gingerbread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's more, the Optimus 3D is unlikely to get much competition for the 3D crown in the short-term. The GSM-loving version of the HTC EVO 3D hasn't even been announced yet. So the Optimus 3D will basically be enjoying a free run at launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC EVO 3D</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get a better idea of the chances of that happening when we get a retail-ready unit of the Optimus 3D to test. Right now the prospects look bright. Would we like some more 3D? Yes, please.</paragraph>
