		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite a few people were getting impatient at one point but a Sony flagship is well worth waiting for. But then, wasn't it clear well before the impatience started to kick in that owners of the original Xperia Z had a lot more to look forward to than those holding the - still relatively new - Z1?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One can easily blame it on the shorter upgrade cycle that the Sony Xperia Z2 is in many ways an incremental upgrade - like most of the competing flagships of late. A tad bigger screen, a bump in processing power, camera upgrades and the latest software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip that over though - and you'll notice a much-improved screen, actually a brand new IPS LCD. Plus, a bigger screen diagonal of 5.2" hasn't blown the size out of proportion - the Sony Xperia Z2 has managed to keep virtually the same footprint by just slimming down the screen bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there is more. You get 3GB RAM up from 2GB, a more robust Adreno 330 graphics chip, 4x the video recording resolution, there are now stereo front speakers, and the latest Android 4.4 KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Could the Sony Xperia Z2 have been better? Other recent flagships have failed to make a big splash - as in bringing anything quite impressive or unexpected. But those comparisons have yet to come. The Z2 is in fact better than Z1 - in terms of screen quality and battery life. Not as much better perhaps as some may've hoped? Or maybe the thing is it's just better - when it could've been mind-blowing. Says who?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alright, it depends on where you're coming from. We're only about to start discovering just how good the Sony Xperia Z2 is. We can't help but wonder as well what kind of impact a likely Z2 compact and a possible new flagship six months from now may have on the sales of the Xperia Z2, which is already some time behind major rivals like the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Xperia Z2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 comes in a familiar package Sony typically ships its Xperia line of smartphones in. Having handed out lots of digital content and accessories to tease the launch and pre-order campaign, Sony didn't bother put any special treats inside the box. A compact charger, a microUSB cable and a headset is all you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pair of headphones is quite good though - the Sony MDR-NC31EM comes with noise-cancelling capability and is specially designed to provide crisp and loud audio on the Xperia Z2 line, including the tablet. Unfortunately, we didn't get the headphones themselves in our review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On some markets the Xperia Z2 may be bundled with Sony's latest Smart band. t's a fitness tracker band, which pairs quite nicely with Sony's line of Xperia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The band's brains are hidden inside a little white plastic insert, which can be easily transferred to a range of band styles to match your taste. It just slots in its place. The SmartBand we got came with a standard black rubber band and there are two bands of different sizes inside the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has a slightly bigger display and more battery capacity, yet manages to keep the same footprint as the Xperia Z1 and has even lost some weight. The dimensions are 146.8 x 73.3 x 8.2mm - that's 3mm taller, but about a millimeter narrower and a tad slimmer. It now weighs 7g less than Xperia Z1 at 163g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This wasn't that hard considering the Xperia Z1 has screen bezel to spare - a source of much criticism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go some mug shots of the Xperia Z2 next to other popular Snapdragon 801-powered flagships. It is about as tall as the 5" HTC One (M8), but thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a 5.1" display with super slim bezels, helping an overall slightly more compact body compared to the Sony Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Six months or less is quite a short time to come up with a completely new design, especially when the bar is set so high already. And to say why fix it if it ain't broke would be a massive understatement for the OmniBalance body wrought from aluminum and covered in scratch-resistant glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is using a &#x430; two-stage process to anodize the aluminum and has finished the sides for a two-tone look, which works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We doubt it that any real Sony fan would settle for plastic even though it would have made the Xperia Z2 lighter. Glass and aluminum is a premium blend and the Xperia flagships do look gorgeous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's a water and dust proof unibody yet again - nothing for Sony to fix in this department. All slots and ports are where they were on the Xperia Z1, protected by plastic flaps with rubber seals to keep water and dust out and keep the design intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both front and rear sheets of glass are shatter proof and scratch-resistant. No word on any sort of oleophobic coating, but even though smudges do occur, the panels are very easy to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Xperia Z2 is a pleasure - it is big and the flat sides don't have the best grip, but the feel of glass against your palm combined with this kind of heft is second-to-none. Sure, the Xperia Z2 will slip into pockets with relative ease for its size and looks more than make up for the solid 163g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A 5.2" 1080p IPS display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 comes with a 5.2" 1080p Triluminos IPS display, backed up by the company's X-Reality engine. We've already seen the X-Reality Engine in action on the Xperia Z1, so we know that it's clearly superior to most of the screens Sony has produced in the past. The IPS display is definitely welcome as it deliver superb viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel density breaks down to 424ppi, which is as good as it gets in terms of sharpness. No matter how closely you look, you won't be able to tell pixels apart and images will always look tack sharp (provided they have enough resolution in the first place).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A key area that has seen further improvement courtesy of the IPS display is viewing angles. Those have been a long-standing issue of all of the company's screens over the past few years, but they have been tweaked in the Xperia Z1 and they are now even better in the Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native display contrast of the Sony Xperia Z2 is somewhat less impressive as on the Xperia Z1 because the Z2's screen isn't as bright as its predecessor's. Colors are nicely punchy, but still fairly accurate. If you'd like a bit of extra punch to your images and videos you should enable the X-Reality engine, which is the successor of the Mobile Bravia Engine. It aims to improve sharpness, reduce noise, while boosting contrast and saturation, and it does a pretty good job of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2's screen is more reflective than the Xperia Z1's, which means we got a lesser score in our dedicated sunlight legibility test. We tried the Xperia Z1 and Xperia Z2 side by side under direct sunlight and being noticeably brighter, indeed we found the Xperia Z1 screen easier to read and work with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2's screen may not earn it too many bonus point in today's market saturated with mind-blowing displays, but it's still a great unit and can't be held against the smartphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are the usual sensors above the 5.2" display, next to a 2.2MP front-facing camera. What's new is the stereo speakers, a nice addition to the flagship spec sheet, helping an immersive experience when watching videos or listening to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each speaker is hidden underneath a very thin but elongated grille carved out of the front glass. The top speaker doubles as an earpiece and the LED notification light is integrated therein too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Xperia Z2 is very busy. In the upper corner is the microSIM compartment under its protective flap. Just below it is the signature power key, followed by a volume rocker. Finally, there is the two-stage shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side has the microSD card slot and the microUSB port under a protective plastic lid as well. Naturally, it should be properly closed if you want your Xperia Z2 to be dust and water proof. The lanyard eyelet is also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone holds the exposed but waterproofed 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary microphone allowing stereo sound in videos and keeping ambient noise out of calls. The primary mic is at the bottom of the Sony Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire back is covered by a scratch-resistant glass of undisclosed origin. One of the key features of the Sony Xperia Z2 - the 20.7MP camera lens - is in the top left corner. It's a 27mm wide Sony G lens with a fast F/2.0 aperture and the Sony Exmor RS backside illuminated (BSI) sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you were hoping for a more powerful LED flash, dual or a true-tone LED, you'll be disappointed. The Xperia Z2 uses the same tiny singe-LED flash we saw on the Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is powered by a 3,200mAh Li-Ion battery - sealed under the sheet of glass, it's non-user-replaceable as usual. It's a bigger battery, the one in the Z1 was only 3000 mAh. We couldn't wait to do our battery test and find out whether the new Xperia Z2 can do better than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we did what we usually do and the Sony Xperia Z2 turned out an amazing performer. An overall rating of 89 hours was mostly down to vastly improved video playback and web browsing times. This means your Xperia Z2 will last just shy of four days if used for an hour each of video playback, calls over a 3G network and web browsing a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Sony Xperia Z2 battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is the company's first smartphone to come with Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box. The software package looks very much the same whatever the Android version though and that's why everything feels and seems so familiar compared to the Z1. Sony has managed to sneak a few improvements along the way, but nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes our usual demo video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the usual affair - it supports widgets (one per pane), plus there is a shortcut to the camera at the bottom courtesy of Android KitKat. There are a few available default widgets, but you can always get more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 lets you add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff on the homescreen is easy, as it is the customization. You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area loses the quick toggles, but don't you worry, they've been just moved on a separate tab. You can gain quick access to the Quick Settings tab with a two-finger swipe from the top. The toggles are customizable and you can choose between 20+ different toggles and have up to 12 of them visible in their dedicated page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia Z2 and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Touch Lock. You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can access Google Now by swiping from the bottom of the UI. We noticed a new shortcut right next to the Google Now launch key called What's new. This app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today, but it isn't limited to the Play Store only. It'll display content from Sony's PlayStation store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet the user interface is buttery smooth, there is no lag and everything happens lightning-fast. The Sony launcher is lightweight and, combined with the snappy chipset and the fastest available Android OS, you'll get an amazing UI experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z2 is based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset model MSM8974AB, which keeps the Krait 400 CPU clock at 2.27GHz, but boost the GPU speed from 450MHz to 550MHz. The MSM8974AC chipset that powers the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Oppo Find 7 is slightly more powerful clocking the CPU at 2.5GHz and the GPU at 578MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Xperia Z2 has Snapdragon 801 chipset inside with four Krait 400 cores clocked at 2.27GHz, an Adreno 330 GPU @550MHz and 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first test - BenchmarkPi - tests the single CPU core performance and the Krait 400 scored on par with other Snapdragon 800-powered devices such as the LG G Pro 2 and the LG Nexus 5, though worse compared to the rest of the S800 and S801 gangs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 is a multi-thread CPU benchmark, where the Xperia Z2 managed to output an excellent mark that places among the best devices we've tested so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In compound benchmarks - Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 ? the Xperia Z2 produced similar scores to the other S800 smartphones such as the Galaxy Note 3, LG G2 and G Flex. It has the same CPU, but it seems the faster GPU didn't matter here as it did on Oppo Find 7a and HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II tests just about every facet of your phone's performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to offscreen benchmarks, the higher clock speed of the new Adreno 330 easily pushes it among the best performers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 3.0 Manhattan (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lower resolution phones (720p or so) like the Xperia Z1 Compact and iPhone 5s climb on top, but as far as 1080p devices go, the Sony Xperia Z2 matches the results of the S801-running HTC One (M8) and Samsung Galaxy S5 on the GFXBench onscreen suite.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 3.0 Manhattan (1080p on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is an integral part to any smartphone experience, and the Xperia Z2 posts respectable, if not remarkable, results in both of our browser benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Sony Xperia Z2 clearly proved some great scores even though for some reason it is not topping the benchmark charts. For what it's worth, the Xperia Z1 even managed to beat it at times. But whatever the tests are showing, the Xperia Z2 delivers amazing buttery-smooth UI experience and high-performance hiccup-free gaming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers and an alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is available, quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia Z2 was nothing short of pleasing. There is noise-cancelling options that is on by default, but you can turn it off from Settings. There is also a Slow Talk option, which will actively slow the speech of the other calling party. You can even apply equalizer settings, but you can choose only between Normal, Bright and Smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer support smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z2 scored an Average mark in our loudspeaker tests, meaning you are unlikely to miss some calls and notifications if you are in a noisy environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, but that made very little to no difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia Z2 offers a customizable on-screen full QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-hand size keyboard is available too, but only in portrait orientation. If enabled, it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen so it gets more comfortable for single handed text input.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A refreshed Album gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous versions there isn't a homepage that hosts all of your albums, instead you get the same swipe-able menu the app drawer is offering. There you can find all of your online and offline albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player could have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 format and won't pull info about individual episodes. It gets worse, Gracenote seems to be lacking info on TV shows in general, we couldn't find even popular shows like The Big Bang Theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is more bad news - the video player does plays 1080p files hassle-free but the supported codecs are limited to Xvid, MP4 and MKV files. DTS, DD and AC3 audios are not supported, which makes the MKV compatibility pretty much obsolete. We know you can always get a proper app from the Play Store but it's a shame you can't just use the eye-candy default player for everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the video player supports subtitles, and you can customize their looks. Unfortunately, you cannot manually pick the subtitle file, it has to reside in the video folder to load up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Walkman audio player gets a new menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. It features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on a hidden swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player with your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the app drawer or the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details. Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is one of the few Snapdragon 800/801 devices to feature an FM Radio. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is flagship-clean, but pretty quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is a flagship smartphone from a company that achieved much of its fame thanks to its audio products and the Walkman lineup in particular, so understandably expectations were high here. The smartphone packs a bunch of interesting audio options, one of which relates directly to our test - the ClearStereo feature in the setting promises to deliver better stereo quality, so we decided to do the test twice and see what difference it makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When plugged into an active external amplifier, the Sony Xperia Z2 did very well as far as the quality of its output is concerned. All the scores it posted were excellent meaning all your tracks will sound exactly as they were meant to. The volume levels were somewhat disappointing though as the flagship was one of the quieter devices we have seen recently and certainly no match for its direct rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ironically, enabling ClearStereo here has a rather damaging effect on stereo crosstalk, so you would be better off staying away from it if you are going to use the Xperia Z2 with your car audio or home stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Somewhat surprisingly, when you plug in a pair of headphones, there is quite a lot of distortion - both intermodulation and harmonic. The other readings remain rather good, but that's not quite enough to save the day for the Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn on ClearStereo however and things look rather different - the distortion is brought back under control. And while the noise levels, dynamic range and, yes, stereo crosstalk worsen a tiny bit, they still remain very good and the new scores add up to a much better performance. So the ClearStereo mode can actually be recommended when you are using your headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly volume levels are below average either way, but that doesn't matter as much as the clarity of the sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Sony Xperia Z1, we'd say the Xperia Z2 does a better job in terms of audio output, mostly due to the better quality of its stereo with headphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Same 20.7 MP shooter, smarter software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia Z2 comes with legacy imaging hardware but adds some useful software advancements coupled with the superior chipset. The camera is the same 20.7 MP unit we've seen in the Xperia Z1 and Z1 Compact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sports an above average for mobile Exmor RS backside illuminated 1/2.3" sensor (70% bigger than the standard 1/3"), uses the same wide angle 27 mm Sony G Lens with f/2.0 aperture and BIONZ image processor. It delivers photos with a maximum resolution of 5248 &#x445; 3936 in 4:3 aspect ratio and gives you a wide selection of other resolutions to shoot it, the most common being 8 MP in 16:9 aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are our findings about the Xperia Z2 camera in short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we like:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we don't like:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has implemented features such as Background Defocus, which blurs the backgrounds leaving objects in the foreground nicely in focus. This functionality is available for download on other Xperia smartphones running Android Jelly Bean 4.3 and above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the camera on will immediately impress - Sony has utilized a very high framerate for the viewfinder and the on-screen image is extremely fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other shooting modes as well, but we've already seen them on older Xperias.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is a little old-fashioned and even confusing at times. It consists of two columns, the right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, shutter keys for the camcorder and the still camera, and a shooting mode button. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The column on the left hosts a flash mode toggle, front/back camera toggle and the settings button, which brings out a panel with some settings. These settings will change for the different shooting modes, allowing you to tune more or fewer stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters the camera would encourage you to snap predominantly in Superior Auto mode. It automatically choses out of the many shooting modes to determine the best one for you. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode. The downside is it limits photos to 8MP resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio. We guess this is Sony's answer to Nokia's super sampling (a.k.a. PureView mode), but from a user's perspective it doesn't feel that good to give away the proudly inscribed on the back 20.7MP resolution. On the positive side, we've seen that in the previous 20MP Sony smartphones, the image quality in Superior Auto is substantially better so the trade-off might actually be worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there is the Manual mode, where you get to use the "Manual controls", though these sound more impressive than they really are. There's an exposure compensation slider, a white balance selector, and also ISO, metering and some focus modes appear buried in the settings menu. And that's all - with a name like that we were hoping for some manual focus, or at least a way to tune contrast, saturation, sharpness and so on. Those are, you know, the settings normal Android phones get even without buzz words like "manual mode."</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual shutter keys are nice, but the Xperia Z2 also has a hardware shutter key. When the phone is locked, pressing it can unlock the phone and start the camera in still or video mode. It can also snap a photo or start capturing video immediately. This might come in handy for those occasions when you just can't afford to miss a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available focus modes include Face detection, Smile shutter, Touch capture (with Burst option) and Tracking auto-focus. In Manual mode you can also choose from a selection of Scene modes, but keep in mind that those only work if you move down from 20.7 MP resolution - at maximum resolution the phone cannot use scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama - it allows you to shoot panoramas by sweeping with the phone sideways in either portrait or landscape orientation. Sadly, the mode doesn't utilize the built-in accelerometer and you have to set your chosen orientation manually. Panorama mode doesn't work very good as it can't quite match what Apple has with their variable exposure panoramas where the phone would adjust excellently to high contrast scenes. Instead, here the phone locks the exposure in accordance to the first fame of the panorama and more often than not, you end up with a blown up sky like we did. Secondly, the stitching of individual images isn't very good. You can see stitching artefacts throughout the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs visual cues to track your motion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed - the resolution drops to 1080p and the graphics are unbecoming of the potent Snapdragon chipset inside the Xperia Z2. Especially since it doesn't have to render them at 60fps in real time, for the final image it just needs one static frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Info-eye feature is similar to Goggle's Goggles app. It can recognize text, business cards, QR and barcodes, landmarks, bottles of wine and even book covers, too. Sony has partnered with leading companies in their respective fields to provide the necessary product info (e.g. Amazon for books, Vino for wines, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works quite well and provides nice at-a-glance info. Even more information is available if you scroll down. Sony has utilized the Google Now card design, which helps organize the information in an easy to digest manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other available camera modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 61 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos taken with the Sony Xperia Z2 look really good - especially under good light. Superior Auto mode posts a great amount of detail in each scene we shot. Noise was kept under control and fine textures and objects came out very good. Colors look pleasing but not exaggerated and dynamic range looks defined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Superior Auto mode looks to add quite a bit of sharpening to images, which may not be everyone's cup of tea. There also appears to be some work done on noise reduction, but it's more than welcome when we look at the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want less processed images you'd best go for manual shooting at the full 20.7 MP. These images come out in 4:3 so they are taller and they actually include more information top and bottom. Detail remains very good but there's quite a bit of noise compared to the oversampled 8 MP Superior Auto images. At times noise will be exhibited in well-lit areas even below ISO 200 and we noticed that the corners of the 20.7 MP images tend to be softer compared to the center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similarly to the 20MP images from the Xperia Z1 and Z1 Compact, the Xperia Z2 images exhibit out of focus areas randomly splattered here and there across the image. We can't really say why they appear but they look as if the camera has a lens issue. Upon some testing we found out they are not - we shot a Superior Auto 8 MP shot and a manual 8 MP shot - the latter had the smudging while the SA one didn't. We hoped Sony would have resolved the issue by now - it's their third consecutive model to have it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The macro shots with the Xperia Z2 come out very good, just as with the Z1. We took this close up in both SA mode and in manual. As you can see the level of detail is very nice even at this close distance (slightly under 10 cm) and there's nice separation between the object and the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode captures a couple images in different exposures and combines them for a better exposure throughout the scene. Sony's HDR mode is very moderate, compared to some rivals like HTC and Samsung and resembles that of the LG flagships. It enhances the detail in the sky and in the shadows but leaves the highlights and well exposed bits of the scene intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the difference in the images below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to low light where the camera gets really noisy. Images come out very bright with a good level of detail, but also exhibit a lot of grainy noise. Perhaps they would have been better with a little more aggressive noise reduction. The sample on the right comes with flash on auto. The flash isn't the best we've seen on a smartphone - we had a tough time seeing the advantages of it. In this low-light setting the ISO was kept below 400 but the noise levels were still quite high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual mode at 20.7 MP tells the same story but at a bigger resolution. ISO is again pretty low for the amount of light in the room and noise is very noticeable, especially towards the darker edges of the scene. There's still enough detail, though. The flash seems to help get some detail back compared to the non-flash image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Background Defocus shoots an image and then blurs out the parts of the image it considers background. The effect tries to emulate the much sought-after bokeh effect of using a higher-end camera with a wide-aperture lens and lets you adjust where you want the focus to be after taking the shot. However the blur outline isn't perfect as you can see in the image below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Clear Image Zoom, which Sony claims will let you zoom in on the scene and still get a 20MP image. We tested this claim by shooting one 20.7 MP image zoomed in and another zoomed out and later cropped the second image to match the zoom level of the former.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To reach the same level of magnification as the maximum zoom, we had to interpolate the normal image up to 80MP and then crop the central area with a coverage of 20MP. We did this using Photoshop, but it's still nice to have it done in camera in an instant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 100% crop below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our in-depth image comparison tool where you can compare the Xperia Z2 to the huge list of other smartphones in our database at 100% zoom level. The first tool shows the 20.7 MP performance.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z2 with Superior Auto mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Still camera conclusion</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is a very capable shooter, especially in good light. Sony still hasn't found the post-processing formula and it still exhibits high noise levels in low light. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any changes in the still camera department, compared to the Xperia Z1 as our test on the next page shows.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z2 vs Z1 - camera performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While we were reviewing the Sony Xperia Z2 we had the Xperia Z1 on hand and decided to test if the two had any differences in image quality. Both Xperias are running the latest Android KitKat software, so the playing field was even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot the majority of images in Superior Auto mode at the only available 8MP resolution. We did a single shot in manual mode at the full available resolution. We have a couple of 100%, un-processed crops, followed by the full resolution sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Superior Auto comparison (8MP)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the images taken from far away, it seems that both smartphones capture about the same levels of detail. The Xperia Z2 appears to have applied a little extra sharpening but detail-wise the image is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a look at a scene shot up close and personal, we see the same effect in action - the same level of detail but a tad sharper post-processing by the Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to see the differences for yourselves you can check out these 8 MP Superior Auto samples from both smartphones below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual Mode comparison (20MP)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we look at the 20.7 MP shots, we see a bigger difference - the colors on the Sony Xperia Z2 seem darker, but we can attribute this to a slightly darker exposure setting. The level of detail again seems to be on par, but the Xperia Z2 looks a bit softer in comparison to the Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the full samples from which the crop was made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low-light comparison (Superior Auto and Manual mode)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we come to low light performance. The results are again consistent with what we just saw in the well-lit samples above. The Sony Xperia Z2 and Z1 resolve almost an identical level of detail, with the Xperia Z2 going a tad sharper. The Xperia Z1 prefers a softer approach. The strength of their respective LED flashes also seems on par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out the full samples we shot below. The first batch is of the Sony Xperia Z2 - shot without and with the flash. We've divided the samples into 8 MP Superior Auto ones and full 20.7 MP ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many were hoping to see a bigger leap in quality between the two generations but that's not the case. For all practical purposes, we would consider the camera outputs of both phones identical.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>4K video is a go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A substantial upgrade over the Z1 can be found in the video camcorder. The new phone puts to good use its newer chipset and now can shoot 4K (or UHD for Ultra High Definition) video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are the other shooting modes as well - you can go for 1080p videos at 30 or 60 frames per second (the latter looks way smoother thanks to the doubled framerate) and also HDR video at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It captures videos in the pixelicious 3840 x 2160 px resolution (hence the 2160p monicker). That's more than double the linear resolution of a FullHD video. Of course, such a video recording would be best appreciated on a 4K screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a video shutter button in the camera interface or you can go to manual mode and select video as well. That will give you select options for just video. If you want to shoot UHD video there's a shooting mode for it when you press the mode button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 outputs 4K video with a bitrate of almost 53 Mbps, which stacks nicely against the 47 Mbps of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or the 46 Mbps of the Samsung Galaxy S5. Framerate was a constant 30 fps, while audio was recorded at 150 Kbps bitrate with a sampling rate of 48 kHz and, naturally, stereo channels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FullHD videos at 30 fps carry a bitrate of 17 Mbps - less than half of the UHD mode, but that's expected. Framerate was again a constraint 30 fps, while the audio bitrate was set at 154 Kbps. Smoother 1080p videos at 60 fps have a bitrate of 29 Mbps with almost the same audio bitrate at 153 Kbps. And finally, there is the 1080p HDR video, which has the same bitrate for video and audio as the regular FullHD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is usual for Sony smartphones, the video quality is up there with the best. Detail is more than adequate at 1080p and a lot higher in the 4K video. Videos run smooth and the smartphone picked the right exposure every time. Focus was continuously adjusting in line with the many moving objects in the frame. If you prefer it locked during shooting the video, you can always deselect the Continuous autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR videos weren't all that great in capturing the scene's true high dynamic range. They more or less just look grey throughout the scene and as HDR goes are flatter than regular videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 makes really good videos. If you want a better performing camcorder, your only option would be the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or Galaxy S5 - they are the only ones that can beat the Xperia Z2 on quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the full samples uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another video mode you can shoot in is called Timeshift video. It shoots videos in 1280 x 720 resolution at 120 frames per second. It then plays back the video at 30 fps and allows you to choose which part of the video is played back at 120 fps slow motion. It's really nice.</paragraph>

It will show you the camcorder capabilities for resolution and detail resolving in both good and low light shooting scenarios and compare them to any of the numerous smartphones in our database.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has everything covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has quad-band 2G and penta-band 3G connectivity across all regional models, and support for more LTE bands than you can shake a stick at. The LTE is Cat. 4 meaning it can theoretically reach 150Mbps downlink and 50Mpbs uplink. Outside LTE coverage, the Xperia Z2 is rated for mobile data speeds of up to 42 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use it through the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers). There is also support for the ultra-low power ANT+ connectivity protocol, which is usually used for connecting to various sports accessories such as heart rate monitors or bicycle speed &amp; cadence meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 features NFC too, but there's no app to handle the NFC functions out of the box. Luckily, there are plenty of capable NFC apps in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go support, so you can attach external flash drives to the smartphone as well. The port is MHL-enabled and you can use a compatible HDMI adapter for TV output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Smart Connect app comes pre-installed - it allows you to set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or during a time interval (e.g. mute alarms at night). It doesn't work with NFC tags though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups. Reduce data usage does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z2 also features the Office Suite 7, which supports creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and File Manager apps are available by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife app comes pre-installed too. It is a service similar to Samsung's My Magazine and HTC One's Blinkfeed. The interface is clean and simple yet beautiful, and there are lots of preloaded feeds. You can add your own RSS links too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is the Sony PlayStation app too, which allows you to browse your PlayStation profile, avatar and achievements. It's far from Microsoft default Xbox app on Windows Phone, but it's something. It can also connect to your PS4 and extract various content from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Select does the same as the Sony's What's New app, but comes with much less functions and old UI. We feel Sony should retire it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and Navigation are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support. Offline maps are available, again, since the last update, so you can save some data traffic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is an easy phone to love and want. And not necessarily by die-hard Sony fans either. Great looks matched by performance, the premium Xperia line has been earning the company both profit - and a loyal following. It's just not as straightforward for a portion of the latter. Xperia Z1 owners will probably see little point upgrading. There is no need to sugarcoat this fact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is what the Xperia Z2 has to offer over the Xperia Z1:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you take Sony's word, the Xperia Z2 isn't meant to replace the Xperia Z1. It's the latest flagship breed, taking advantage of the latest in technology. If anyone was hoping for it to introduce revolutionary features, they'd be disappointed. On the other hand, these may eventually come - sooner than we think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has announced a new, shorter upgrade cycle targeting a flagship smartphone release every six months. The company thinks this is the best way to stay relevant. This is pretty much the time Qualcomm needs to get the next top-of-the-line Snapdragon out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 is the first device in this bold experiment. The latest Snapdragon 801 chipset in mass production goes without saying but Sony's move to IPS displays is just as welcome. A pair of stereo speakers, better battery life and 4K videos added to the tally should be enough of a raison d'?tre. There is the latest Android 4.4 KitKat too, matched by the most recent revision of Sony's proprietary launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, if your glass is half-empty, the whole thing will boil down to a chipset-driven revision. Whether it's because Sony long had a feature, which others were late to match (water-proofing), or needed to catch up elsewhere (IPS LCD and stereo speakers), the difference between Z2 and Z1 is about as big as that between Snapdragon 800 and 801. That's to say, a welcome boost but hardly life-changing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all bad though, after all users are given a choice - have the flagship proper or a slightly under-equipped alternative for a lower price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's by no means a Sony invention - Oppo is actually taking it to an extreme with a pair of flagships in the Find 7a and its QHD-screened sibling, Find 7. Both have large 5.5" displays, Snapdragon 801 chipsets and solid 13MP cameras. Oppo is charging ?399 for the 1080p Find 7a and an extra ?100 for the Find 7 - and it seems like a reasonable deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Oppo Find 7a ? Oppo Find 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung's Galaxy S5 is the real challenge though - currently one of the most popular smartphones out there, backed up by aggressive marketing. It is now able to match Sony's water-proof design, but throws in a new camera sensor and has an edge in processing power, with the more capable version of Snapdragon 801. There're a few extras too such as the fingerprint scanner and hear-rate monitor. It's around ?50 cheaper, but nowhere near as good looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, here's one that is, the HTC One (M8). A proper chipset upgrade and an even more impressive build quality, HTC has done an amazing job both on the inside and the outside, making the One (M8) one of the preferred devices today - also a good ?50 cheaper than the Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony had no time - or care - for gimmicks, like HTC's dual camera and Zoe, or Samsung's new sensors. That's the impression the Xperia Z2 makes. It's sexy and it knows it. Iconic design and standard-setting build quality in a package powered by the latest chipset. Sony fans will love it (never mind the chipset could've been an extra bit more powerful). You can love it, too - if you believe in "good just got better". Not quite so if you trust in "better because it can do more".</paragraph>
