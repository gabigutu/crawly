		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's got a plan and it's sticking to it - while other makers pile software feature upon feature, the Japanese focus on their historical strengths, such as beautiful, durable design, photographic excellence and enviable display tech. That in short is what the Xperia Z1 is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper Xperia echelon is known for its slim design and the Z1 is no exception - 8.5mm doesn't sound wafer thin, but not until you realize that inside this phone's body there's a 1/2.3" sensor and a 3,000mAh battery. The sensor is 70% bigger in terms of surface area than what smartphones usually get (1/3") and large sensors require bigger optics, hence thicker phones. The same goes for high-capacity batteries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the big, high-resolution sensor will give the Xperia Z1 a leg up on the competition in the imaging department. But Sony is also responding to Nokia's propensity for name-dropping (ZEISS lenses) by using its own sensor brand and lens design, plus a BIONZ image processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no unsightly humps (looking at you, Lumia 1020 and Galaxy S4 zoom) the Xperia Z1 makes the OmniBalance design shine. It's an aluminum frame, with durable glass panels on both the front and back, and design accents like the aluminum power key and the color notification light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget the IP58 certification, which means the phone will easily go swimming with you so you can take it in the pool or wade into the sea. Water resistance is good all year round, not just summer vacation - a spilled glass can turn a $600+ gadget into a paperweight. You or someone you know has at one point stood over a bag of rice hoping to bring their wet phone back to life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And unlike their treatment of the Xperia Z, this time around Sony is using the best chipset on the market, the Snapdragon 800. Also, a good deal of work has gone into the screen, another point the Xperia Z was criticized on. Finally, the Sony Xperia Z1 even manages to shame the competition by having expandable storage, even though this complicates the waterproofing process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's recent press releases indicate that the mobile phone business is becoming one of the main money makers (same goes for Samsung) and you can tell the company's heart is into making the best product around. Jump over to the next page to see whether ambition has matched competence.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 box is quite small and slim, considering there's a fairly large device inside. While compact packaging is impressive, there's a downside - part of why the box is so small is because Sony chose not to include a headset. While people who care about sound would probably use their own, we still expected to have one in the box, this is an expensive flagship after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you get is the phone itself, a compact charger and a microUSB cable for charging and data transfer. We certainly hope your regional retail package does better than that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 measures 144 x 74 x 8.5 mm - it's thin but almost 6mm taller and 3mm wider than the LG G2 (with a 5.2" screen). The 170g of weight is above average too. Yes, the Lumia 920 was heavier, but the xenon-packing Lumia 1020 and 928 are both around 160g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OmniBalance permeates the Sony Xperia line, making high-end phones stand out and more affordable phones look premium. The Xperia Z1 is as high as it gets in the smartphone food chain and Sony has spared no expense building it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum chassis is carved out of a solid block of aluminum and it really is just a frame - most of the material is removed, leaving only a light but tough frame. The two scratch-resistant glass panels on the front and back, the big battery and the water-resistant seals are surely to blame for making the Xperia Z1 heavier than the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aluminum and glass do look and feel good though, plastic would have made for a lighter phone but nine out of ten times it completely lacks the premium feel of the Z1 materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that deserves commendation is that Sony has worked in a good deal of easily accessible ports and slots - the microSIM and microSD card slots can be opened with bare hands, unlike most unibody phones that require a SIM ejector and omit the memory slot altogether. Those slots are protected by plastic flaps with rubber seals to keep water out and, better yet, flow smoothly with the design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more, the Sony Xperia Z1 is one of the few phones (especially Androids) that has a hardware shutter key. Yes, on-screen controls have become quite good and enable things like touch focus, but a hardware key is still one of our preferred ways to snap a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's all well-deserved praise for Sony's work on the Xperia Z1 design, but we do have an issue with it - quite simply, it's a little too big. It's bigger than the Xperia Z, which was already on the big side and ergonomics suffer from the extra width, especially with the angles on the side of the frame that dig into your palm a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding the Z1 is a different experience than most 5" phones, which are already too big or at least on the very line for some people. To be honest, the Z1 is quite a handful and the chunky 170g of weight doesn't help the in-hand feel either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pocketability is also hurt a bit by the size of the handset - the Xperia Z1 is thin enough to slip into most pockets but every time you bend your leg the phone will remind you of its presence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that said, we can hold and use the Z1 but it's dangerously close to the experience you get with phablets like the LG Optimus G and Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which call for two-hand usage and at least make up for the less than perfect ergonomics by offering substantially more screen real estate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is a typical Xperia member - you can see a screen on the front and almost nothing else, but hidden are the RGB notification light, sensors and a front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facer is a 2.1MP unit, enough resolution for 1080p video. The status LED is hidden inside the earpiece this time rather than having a dedicated spot. It's a bit small and, being inside the recessed earpiece, visibility at an angle is worse. We would have liked to see a large strip below the screen - there's plenty of room there (which is currently blank space) and big RGB strips are both attractive and easy to see as previous Xperia designs have demonstrated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's move on to the sides of the handset. Sony is using a new two-stage process to anodize the aluminum and has painted the middle of the sides for a two-tone look, which works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is the busiest. In the upper corner is the microSIM card slot under its protective flap. Just below it is the aluminum power key (a signature element of the OmniBalance design) and the volume rocker (which is a bit too small and thin for our taste). And at the bottom of the right side - or the right corner if you hold the Xperia Z1 horizontally to take a shot - is the two-stage shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the device are two more flaps, one for the microSD card slot (marked by a subtle microSD label and logo) and one for the microUSB port. All the flaps are rubber-lined to keep water out, but that means you have to open them to use what's underneath - changing a SIM or SD card is rare, but plugging in the microUSB port is fairly common (mostly to charge the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To compensate for that, Sony has left two pogo pins exposed that can charge the phone without worrying about flaps, provided you have a compatible accessory like the charging dock. That dock has magnets that match the magnets in the phone itself, so that the two snap together with the pogo pins perfectly aligned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone holds the 3.5mm audio jack that has been left exposed. That's not a cause for concern though as the jack has been waterproofed (on the Xperia Z, the jack was under a flap, which was annoying). The loudspeaker at the bottom is bigger than the speaker on the Xperia Z1, but we've yet to see if that's just the grille or the speaker really is more powerful (we'll get to that in the telephony chapter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone is one big slab of scratch-resistant glass. Sony doesn't say who made this particular glass, but on the Xperia Z it was reportedly something called Dragon Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the back also holds the headline feature of the Sony Xperia Z1, the 20.7MP camera lens. It has a wide 27mm wide Sony G Lens with a fast F/2.0 aperture and a Sony Exmor RS backside illuminated (BSI) sensor, which as we've already mentioned, is 70% bigger than the majority of smartphone camera sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fast aperture and a big BSI sensor is what you want to hear if you're looking for great low-light photography. A small, single-LED flash is not. We'll see if the Z1 can deliver on its promises.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Triluminos display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 comes with a 5" 1080p Triluminos display, backed up by the company's X-Reality engine. Sony has already demonstrated the potential of that combo with the Xperia Z Ultra, so we know that it's clearly superior to the company's screens from the first half of the year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel density breaks down to 441ppi, which is as good as it gets in terms of sharpness. No matter how closely you look, you won't be able to tell pixels apart and images will always look tack sharp (provided they have enough resolution in the first place).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a shot at the underlying pixel matrix of the screen that we've taken with our digital microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A key area that has seen improvement with the latest Sony display tech is viewing angles. Those have been a long-standing issue of all of the company's screens over the past few years, but now things are looking much better. You do get contrast compression when you look from a very wide angle, but everything still remains legible. At this point, the difference between this and the best screens in business is more about the premium feel of icons appearing as if printed on the screen. In terms of usability though, the Xperia Z1 is as good as any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A word of warning is due as we've been getting a lot of user reports that not all Xperia Z1 units out there have the same quality screens. It seems some of them come with panels, which have the same properties as the one on the Xperia Z. These of course, may be pre-production samples or as conspiracy theiorists suggests, leftover panels from the Xperia Z production line. Whatever the case, have this one in mind when you are picking up yours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native display contrast of the Sony Xperia Z1 that we have is great and surprisingly, it's even much better than that of the Z Ultra. Colors are also nicely punchy, but still fairly accurate. If you'd like a bit of extra punch to your images and videos you should enable the X-Reality engine, which is the successor of the Mobile Bravia Engine. It aims to improve sharpness, reduce noise, while boosting contrast and saturation, and it does a pretty good job of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more impressively, the Xperia Z1's screen is much less reflective than those of its predecessor and the Z Ultra. This, combined with its higher brightness, helped the new Sony flagship smartphone to a great score in our dedicated sunlight legibility test. You will have very little issues with this one even in the sunniest of days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Sony Xperia Z1's screen may not earn it too many bonus point in today's market saturated with mind-blowing displays, but it's no longer a liability as it was on the Xperia Z - in fact it even beats some of its rivals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 packs a massive 3,000mAh battery despite its slender body and a Snapdragon 800 chipset, making it fairly similar to the Xperia Z Ultra - except for the screen, which is 5" for the Z1 and 6.4" for the Z Ultra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the smaller screen to lead to an improved battery life, but that wasn't the case. Talk time is spectacular - the best we've seen yet - but web browsing and video playback times are just average. They haven't really moved since the original Xperia Z. At least standby power usage is low, leading to a decent endurance rating.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia Z1 runs on Android 4.2.2 out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 comes with Android 4.2.2 out of the box and Sony's proprietary Xperia launcher on top. The most recent Xperia phones are already running or will soon get Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Sony Xperia Z1 to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 gives you the option to add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background for the virtual on-screen buttons is black when you are running an app and completely transparent when you are browsing homescreen panes and menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area or using the pinch-to-zoom gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The widgets in the Xperia Z1 do resize and re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applying a new theme changes the lockscreen and homescreen wallpaper and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are four docked shortcuts (two each side of the app drawer shortcut). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items, in which case you get smaller icons of the first four shortcuts in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The rightmost pane is special and fires up the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other panes can accommodate various widgets: Email, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, TrackID and Digital clock. You can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is on, the lockscreen will display the music controls by default, but they can be swiped out of the way. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Brightness by default). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. This time around, the toggles are customizable. You can choose between 16 different quick toggles and have up to 10 of them visible in the notification area across two rows of shortcuts. You can even opt out of having the Settings key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there. If you tap and hold on an app, a green Add to Homescreen field will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon and drop it there and you will go back to your homescreen and place a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock Android task manager is onboard. It lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe. The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or you have the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android OS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, all of your multimedia content is saved too, and all system apps such as messaging, call logs, etc. get their data stored safely. Restoring is easy and if you lost something, you can easily bring it back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 is Sony's second device we meet running on the Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 800 chipset. It is powered by a quad-core 2.2GHz Krait 400 processor, with Adreno 330 graphics and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait 400 processor clocked at 2.2GHz (2.15GHz according to GeekBench) is among the fastest processors on the market, second to only the LG G2 (2.26GHz) and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (2.3GHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first test is all about single-core performance, where the Xperia Z1 scored similar results to the other Krait 400-powered competitors.

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, we put all four cores to the test in the multi-core version of the Linpack benchmark. The Sony Xperia Z1 didn't disappoint.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also run the GeekBench 3 CPU benchmark. The Xperia Z1 matched the score of its Xperia Z Ultra sibling, both occupying the top spots in our chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 gauge the overall device performance instead of just the CPU and the Sony Xperia Z1 managed to conquer the first spots on both charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's time to test the new Adreno 330 graphic processing unit. We ran both GLBenchmark tests in off-screen mode, testing raw GPU power. The Xperia Z1 scored identical results to the Xperia Z Ultra and outpaced all other phones we've tested so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Epic Citadel benchmark was updated recently with the new Ultra High Quality setting. We've re-run every 1080p device we had around and, as we expected, the Xperia Z1 matched perfectly the Xperia Z1 Ultra and both are sharing the first place once again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance of the Sony Xperia Z1's Chrome browser is our all-time second-best. The Xperia Z Ultra is the only phone with a better result.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combined BrowserMark 2 benchmark saw another great result by the Sony Xperia Z1, but this time it didn't manage to come on top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Xperia Z1 hit the third place on the Vellamo browser benchmark, just a whisker below its Xperia Z Ultra sibling and the LG G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is one of the fastest smartphones (phablets included) available on the market right now. There's a noticeable performance lead over the Snapdragon 600 competitors and the snappy chipset makes its presence felt in almost everything you do around the Android OS. Once you get your hands on the Z1, you can't help but appreciate the muscle under the hood.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know if there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the large resolution of the Xperia Z1 display, you can get a lot of information from Google Now with just one glance at the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia Z1 gets activated with an upward swipe from a press-and-hold of the Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a separate review of all popular voice assistants, where you can learn even more about Google Now. Just follow this link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show up as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contact feature is present alright - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact, visiting their web page or navigating to their home address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too. This is where the LED strip comes into play as well. You can set a custom color for a contact, so the ambience light can serve as a caller ID of sorts. Of course you cannot have a different color for every single contact in your phonebook but you can have one color be for family, another for work calls and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia Z1 was nothing short of straightforward. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments. All in all, you'll have an effortless time placing calls with the Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite rocking a 5" display, the Xperia Z1 feels substantially larger than its LG G2 and Samsung Galaxy S4 rivals. However, this doesn't make holding it against your ear an uncomfortable experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad in the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia Z1 automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Sony Xperia Z Ultra before it, Xperia Z1 scored a mark of Below average on our loudspeaker tests, meaning you are likely to miss some calls and notifications if you are in a noisy environment. That's probably the trade-off for the phone being watertight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, which noticeably made the sound louder, and then with both xLOUD and ClearPhase on, which sacrificed some of the loudness for improved audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, you'd be better off turning on the vibration and the xLOUD enhancement to make sure you don't to miss any incoming calls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS. Four shortcuts at the bottom of the screen handle the most common cases - an image, a photo, a doodle (you draw with your finger) and your location. This, however, takes an extra row from the screen, which isn't too big to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox for all your email accounts. It supports batch operations and has a Preview pane option in landscape mode - the list of emails goes on the left, the contents of the currently selected email on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is the default app that handles instant messaging (Facebook is preinstalled, but Facebook Messenger isn't). It's Google's attempt at unifying all of its messaging services and while the initial release has some quirks that need ironing, it looks to be a promising platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia Z1 offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is unsurprisingly comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable bilingual word suggestions, symbols on long press, the Google voice typing key and the smiley key. All these options are disabled by default.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller, either with a pinch gesture or a sideways swipe. The whole thing is very responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second tab here, My Albums, which includes online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa) along with albums stored on devices in the local network. Also here are some special albums - Maps and Globe, which use the geo-tagging info to display photos where they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has good UI, codec support could have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI, reminiscent of HTPC interfaces. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 didn't experience any difficulties playing 720p and 1080p videos. It loaded them pretty swtiftly and that's no surprise considering the hardware that's under the hood. MP4, DivX, X264 and MOV files played without a glitch, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While that's certainly an option, you lose the Gracenote features - the Movies app always plays videos (or tries to, anyway) with its own player rather than what you've set as system default. We tried BS Player and it worked well with the aforementioned video formats.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The updated Walkman music player, which is present on all 2013-Xperia smartphones is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has more options for sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's the familiar ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However dedicated audiophiles might want to consider alternatives off the Play Store, with support for a 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is on board as well. It features the Listen Now feature, which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with some neat tricks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has updated the FM Radio app and as a results it's now more stable than it was on some recent mid-range Xperia smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is smooth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 did impressively well in the active external amplifier part of the audio quality test. The smartphone posted excellent scores top to bottom with the below average volume levels the only weak point to its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better still, there's very little quality drop when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises significantly, but distortion remains undetectable and, while signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range are still great. Volume levels are only average here, but the overall performance is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 20.7MP camera promises much, but under delivers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 boasts a unique Exmor RS sensor, custom built for the latest flagship. It's the highest resolution available on an Android smartphone. It beats the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom and even the Galaxy NX EVIL camera by a hair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a relatively large sensor too - at 1/2.3" it's 70% bigger than 1/3" sensors found in most phones, which should make a big difference in terms of noise performance and dynamic range. As part of the Sony Exmor RS family it's a backside illuminated (BSI) sensor, plus it has a wide F/2.0 aperture. These are all good things for low-light photography, though the flash is only a single, small LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 uses a wide-angle (27mm) Sony G Lens camera with a Sony BIONZ image processor. Sony has literally equipped the Xperia Z1 with all the latest tech they have on tap, and that's just the hardware, the Xperia Z1 is very impressive on the software end, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that immediately makes an impression is how smooth the image is in the viewfinder is - it looks like they are using a really high refresh rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface, however, is a little old-fashioned and confusing at times. It consists of two columns, the right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, shutter keys for the camcorder and the still camera, and a shooting mode button. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The column on the left changes more substantially. Here you get a flash mode toggle, front/back camera toggle and the settings button, which brings out a panel with some settings. These settings will change for the different shooting modes, allowing you to tune more or fewer stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode proved to be frustrating too - it limits photos to 8MP resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio. We guess this is Sony's answer to Nokia's super sampling (a.k.a. PureView mode), but dropping from 20.7MP to 8MP is not a great feeling. Especially since unlike the Lumia 1020 you can't keep the full resolution shot and the down sampled shot (the 1020 saves both a 38MP and a 5MP image).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and the Manual mode when everything is set to Auto (yup, you can set the Manual mode to Auto) is that the Superior Auto tries to guess what kind of a scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all image parameters accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual shutter keys are nice, but the Xperia Z1 also has a hardware shutter key. It serves a dual purpose thanks to the Quick launch mode, which unlocks the phone and starts the camera in still or video mode. It can also snap a photo or start capturing video immediately. This might come in handy for those occasions when you just can't afford to miss a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the Sony Xperia Z1 camera offers a plethora of built-in features but we found that some are missing and others are hard to find. The available options include face detection, smile shutter, geo-tagging, touch capture (with Burst option) and tracking auto-focus. You can't manually select a scene - you hope Superior Auto lives up to its name and that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia Z1 several more interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama, which does not work well. You have to move the phone at just the right speed, not too fast, not too slow. This caused the Xperia Z1 to abort the panorama several times just because after pressing the shutter key we hesitated for a second to begin the sweep. Also, panoramas come out with 5MP resolution and the file size clocks in at under a lousy megabyte. Both the iPhone (5, 5c, 5s you name it) and the Galaxy S4 shoot panoramas with tens of megapixels resolution, so the Z1 panorama is... let's just say, underwhelming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs visual cues to track your motion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed - the resolution drops to 1080p and the graphics are unbecoming of a Snapdragon 800 chipset. Especially since it doesn't have to render them at 60fps in real time, for the final image it just needs one static frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Info-eye feature is similar to Goggle's Goggles app. It can recognize text, business cards, QR and barcodes, landmarks, bottles of wine and even book covers, too. Sony has partnered with leading companies in the respective fields to provide info (e.g. Amazon for books, Vino for wines, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works quite well and provides at-a-glance info, but if you scroll down you get a wealth of information. Sony has utilized the Google Now card design, which helps organize info from in an easy to digest manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time. Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 61 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to the image quality. We'll start off with full resolution shots from Manual mode and then look at the Superior Auto shots. We've also done low-light shots to see if all the brand-name camera elements have paid off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end result does capture more fine detail than the 13MP cameras of the competition thanks to the extra resolution. Colors look accurate and the white balance is good, though slightly cool. However, it's not all rosy - there's a lot of visible noise and the noise reduction is still strong enough to smear out some of the fine detail (especially in darker areas of the image). We also had issues with the camera missing the focus in several images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, it looks like there's a lens defect as the image just right of the center looks softer than it should be (we even checked for smudges on the camera and retook the photos). So much for "Sony G Lens". Still, you need to keep in mind this is a pre-production unit we have here for a review (one obtained from Sony itself nevetheless) so quality control oversights are possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all that in mind, we're starting to think Superior Auto wasn't such a bad idea, you're going to downscale the images anyway (the best display you can hope for at the moment is around 8MP). Most of the noise goes away and there's still plenty of fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Silly us, it turns out that the camera indeed has an HDR capture mode, except to get the setting to magically appear, you have to be in Manual mode and select 8MP as the output resolution. As you can guess, the HDR mode doesn't work at 20.7MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two shots, one with HDR off and one with HDR on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is actually the second HDR samples we're taking as the first ones looked too similar and we actually doubted if we had the setting on at all. The second set turned out much better, but the difference is not that big, and certainly not worth losing over half the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shooting in low light makes the noise stronger and you'll need a steady hand as handshake is common. The LED flash doesn't change much but that extra light is enough to bring the noise down a little. Superior Auto once again brings down the noise and you might want to use it in darker scenes where there is not much detail tobeging with, so the downscaling makes no harm anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We uploaded the full resolution 20.7MP photos to our photo quality comparison database rather than the 8MP Superior Auto photos. Still, you can use the tool's downscaling feature to match another phone's resolution or view photos at 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia Z1 in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: On second thought, we decided to include the Superior Auto shots in our Image Compre tool, as well. This way you can see how does this mode compare to the rest of the competition and the untouched 20.7MP shots. You can view both at 100% or downscale the 20.7MP one to 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia Z1 with Superior Auto mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and try to disregard the right side of the image - it is where our review unit's lens issue did worse. Stick to the left side of the image when comparing, we're looking for a second unit to try and reshoot the camera samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps and that's about it. With the inclusion of the powerful Snapdragon 800 SoC we would've liked to see 1080p video recording at 60 fps or even 4K but we guess that's just too much to ask from Sony at this point. In any case, there aren't too many 4K screens around yet, so it may not be such a big loss. 1080p is still competitive enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder app UI is practically the same as the still camera's. You can enable the digital video stabilization (which crops from the field of view), or set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has introduced a new digital image stabilization enhancement dubbed SteadyShot. It works pretty well for a digital stabilization system, you can check the sample below to see it in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that that this drastically changes the field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but that's not of much use as you only get 1080p images, you might as well grab a frame from the video. Also note that the image processing is different than still shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, if you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an actual HDR setting and scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is a reasonably powerful camcorder. It captures 1080p videos at just under 30 frames per second with a good bitrate of 17-18Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 132 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results are pretty good but not perfect. There's enough fine detail, but things look a little pixelated (this could be the effect of poor image sampling). Also the continuous autofocus is much too eager and triggers all the time, even when there's barely anything in front of the camera. Here's a sample for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is not part of the new UHD wave and shoots 1080p videos, which is the norm for current flagships. You can check out how it does against the competition in good and low lighting conditions and look at the ISO chart for a synthetic estimation of the resolved detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has quad-band 2G and 3G connectivity across all regional models, and support for more LTE bands than you can shake a stick at. Outside LTE coverage, the Z1 is rated for mobile data speeds of up to 42 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use it through the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers), and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go support, so you can attach external flash drives to the smartphone as well. The MHL-enabled microUSB port also supports HDMI connections to an external monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A minor annoyance comes from the fact that the microUSB port and the docking pins are on the same side of the device. You can dock the phone to make sure it's being charged, while outputting videos over HDMI, but you'll struggle to find a comfortable position, as even an L-shaped micro-USB will cause the dock to wobble unless you place it on an elevated surface, like a book or something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Media Remote has since been replaced by its TV SideView app, which offers the same basic functionality. Like Media Remote, it isn't preinstalled on the Xperia Z1, but you can get it off the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history. This sort of a remote only works over the Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, replacing the former LiveWare manager. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or at a preset time. It doesn't work with NFC though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, there's no app to handle the NFC functions out of the box, which is strange considering Sony took the time to install a QR code reader app, which will see a lot less use. Luckily, there are plenty of capable NFC apps in the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unmatched browsing with Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome runs ono the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brand new setting is called Reduce data usage and does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone. You can check the graph to see how much data you've saved. Unlike Opera Mini, this mode keeps the full functionality of web pages. Also, secure connections bypass the Google servers for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, keep in mind you can use the Small app browser, which lets you surf while doing other things on the large screen. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to switch from Chrome to the floating browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 comes with the OfficeSuite 7 viewer. OfficeSuite 7 lets you view Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF along with plain text files. Just view them though, as you'll have to buy the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app has made its way onto the Xperia Z1, except this time its drawing capabilities have been moved to a separate Sketch app. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note/sketch and just start typing or doodling. You can customize a wide variety of drawing modes, backgrounds, and stencils, and there's also Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are also available from within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another helpful tool is the Update center, which checks for updates for your phone and your apps. You can enable automatic download with the option to use Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 also comes with Google+ and Facebook apps out of the box. The Facebook app also has a nice widget that will show you updates on the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is where the apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (many even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, which managed to get a lock in about a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 marks the second rebirth of the company's premium take on what a smartphone should be like. The Xperia Z was a great foundation and laid the groundwork for the company to expand with the Z1. Yes, the naming scheme doesn't really make sense, but nowadays manufacturers are very frivolous with the names of their products. But we digress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has matured its OmniBalance design philosophy by ever so seductively continuing to use aluminum and glass. This arguably makes the Xperia Z1 one of the nicest looking smartphone ever. While it's a handsome looking brute, Sony's use of premium materials results in the phone's sizable body. It's a large smartphone by the current standards for a five-incher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We understand why Sony did this. Part of it is due to the larger battery than the Xperia Z. Sadly, it isn't used in the most frugal fashion possible, as we showed you in our extensive battery test. The waterproof nature of the Xperia Z1 also played a significant role in adding bulk to its figure, no doubt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the second part of this enlarged body is because of the updated camera. It uses a custom-built 20.7MP sensor, a 27mm wide-angle lens and a wide F2.0 aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera however failed to impress us and some of the software features feel a bit gimmicky at times. We also hit a snag with the faulty lens, which made almost half of the frame quite blurry. The 8MP limitation of the Intelligent Auto also had us bewildered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major drawback of the original Xperia Z was its display. Washed out and not very good with colors and viewing angles, there was a lot to ask for in the successor. Happily, Sony delivered with the Xperia Z1's 5" full HD Triluminos display and updated X-Reality Engine. The result is the best display that Sony has ever put in a smartphone. That doesn't mean it's the best in the industry, though. The Super AMOLED unit of the Galaxy S4 packs more vibrant colors, while the LG G2's 5.2" screen is brighter and sports better viewing angles. And we're hearing reports that perhaps not all units available worldwide has a display as nice as this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the performance department is where the Sony Xperia Z1 really shines. The Snapdragon 800 chipset packs up a punch and leaves absolutely no room for slowdowns. We're sure that with this chipset, the Android experience would be as smooth as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 offers a unique feature mix, which pretty much limits the number of direct rivals. The plastic build of the LG G2 may put off some of you, but one can't just deny the compact size and gorgeous 5.2" display that is surrounded by virtually no bezels. While not being cheap on its own, Currently, however, the 32GB version of the G2 (this one has no card slot) is more expensive than the 16GB Xperia Z1, but it's equally powerful and it's got a really nice camera as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Size-wise, the Xperia Z1 enters the realm of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Despite the efforts that Sony has put into its renewed Triluminos display it still can't match the color output of the Super AMOLED screen of the Note 3. Samsung's latest phablet also sports the highly revered S Pen, which enhances the experience of the Note 3 a lot. Not to mention the 4K video recording.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If the camera department is of a key concern to you, then the 20.7MP Exmor RS camera of the Xperia Z1 should sounds quite appealing. It's a great piece of camera hardware, but is let down by the software it accompanies it. The Android rivals have more feature-rich camera, which makes the whole thing with the Z1 feel a bit rushed to the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 41MP camera of the Nokia Lumia 1020 is undoubtedly the best one on the market right now. However, the switch to Windows Phone 8 may not be to everyone's liking.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In a beauty contest, the only smartphone that the Xperia Z1 will have a hard time against is the HTC One. The aluminum unibody with the front-mounted stereo speakers continues to warm our hearts. The feel of bare aluminum touching against your skin is a feeling that can only be matched by Sony's extensive use of scratch-protected glass. Both are absolute lookers, but subjectively only one can win your heart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is a charming smartphone with best-in-class feature set. It certainly makes all Sony admirers happy and clearly shows that the company is taken on the right path in its fight as king of the hill. The best intentions aren't always sufficient and making it to the top requires consistent hard work, which Sony is just beginning to put into this business.</paragraph>
