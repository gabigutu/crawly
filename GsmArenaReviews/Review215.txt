			<paragraph>This week has been marked by the announcement of two highly interesting N-series devices, which offer excellent feature packages. The Nokia N85 and the Nokia N79 feature quad-band GSM support, fast HSDPA data transfers, Wi-Fi, GPS, 5 megapixel auto focus cameras and the long specs list continues?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the Nokia N85 and Nokia N79 is exactly what the Nokia N81 and the Nokia N78 should have been in the first place. The N85 and the N79 are not revolutionary, however they expand nicely the company portfolio filling the necessary gaps between the already aging N95 and N82 and adding some novel sparkles to the smartphone market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N85<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N85 sports a dual slide design much like the Nokia N95, but the controversial design takes after the Nokia N81. The most novel feature seems the 2.6-inch 16M color OLED display - it's the biggest OLED display to be integrated in a mobile phone yet. Swapping the TFT technology has its pros and cons and will cover tem duly in a short while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A multimedia device to the bone, the Nokia N85 packs dedicated multimedia keys, accelerometer for automatic screen rotation, stereo Bluetooth, 3.5mm audio jack, TV-out, stereo FM radio with RDS and a FM transmitter. It will even ship with a 8GB microSD card to store your multimedia files. The multimedia keys also serve the double purpose of gaming keys in order to offer an excellent N-gage gaming experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5 megapixel camera with autofocus, dual-LED flash and autofocus assist light is mounted at the back of the device and that deserves attention too. It can manage the sweet VGA video recording at up to 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 will be available in black and copper in October 2008 for an estimated retail price of 450 euro (660 US dollars) before taxes or subsides.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N79<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The bar-shaped Nokia N79 has a bit more modest feature list but has better (or so it seems to us) looks and a more compact boy. It still supports all the four GSM bands but the 3G works only on the 900 and 2100 MHz bands. The display on the N79 is a 2.4" QVGA TFT unit, capable of showing up to 16M colors. Wi-Fi, GPS and a 5 megapixel camera are some of its other more important features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N79 also sports FM radio and FM transmitter, allowing you to broadcast your favorite tracks within a short range over radio waves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N79, much like the N85, features the touch sensitive Navi wheel navigation solution which we first came to know in the Nokia N81. The N79 also has a 3.5mm audio jack and will ship with a 4GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A novel feature of the Nokia N79 is its easily customizable exterior (and interior). The handset will come with two extra Xpress-on covers in the retail package and additional ones can also be purchased. When you put a new back cover on, the N79 recognizes its color and can automatically change the interface theme color to match it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N79 will hit the shelves in Canvas White and Seal Grey color versions in October and will cost 350 euro (515 US dollars) before taxes or subsides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chances are you've already known these details, so we guess you might be more interested in some real life photos and our first impressions. Hit the jump for some of that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N85 - destined to be popular<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N85 seems like the long-waited update of the popular N81 and given the features on board it's almost destined to become a market success. Comparing the N85 to the Nokia N95 8GB, the gap doesn't seem that big now, but you have got to remember that back in the day the N95 was the portfolio flagship, while this time that place is reserved for the long-awaited and seemingly overpriced Nokia N96. The Nokia N82 might be counted here too, but the dual slide design of the N85 tends to speak of a closer kinship to the first two N-series devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N85 can even be counted as an upgrade to N95 8GB in some respects if it wasn't for the smaller display - there's the more compact size, the touch-sensitive Navi wheel, the more compact microUSB port, the supposedly better GPS chipset with 3-month worth of free navigation license and finally, there's the FM transmitter. The Nokia N85 also has a microSD card slot with a pre-bundled 8GB memory card in contrast to the fixed-size memory of the N95 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nokia N85 will occupy a strong upper mid-tier market position and will probably be the next Nokia best-seller - the changes it brings are not revolutionary, but they are some fresh blood to the family. Simply said, the Nokia N85 is everything the Nokia N81 8GB should have been.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N85 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've already mentioned that the Nokia N85 is more compact than the N95 8GB. The slider mechanism feels sturdy and so is the whole construction. The bronze back panel has a glossy finish that adds to the looks of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port are place on the top of the body, while the uncomfortably placed keypad lock key seen in N81 has found a much better place on the right-hand side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated multimedia keys that get revealed when you slide the handset downwards serve the double purpose of gaming keys. Speaking of gaming, the N85 comes preloaded with 15 N-gage titles, however since there is an unlock code for only one, you'll have to choose carefully which one you will get in a full version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 2.6 inches, the Nokia N85 display is slightly smaller than the ones of N95 8GB and the N96, but its most novel feature is the OLED technology used. Nokia first used it on Nokia 7900 Prism and then on the Nokia Arte. The OLED display is supposed to give you lower power consumption, wider viewing angles and better contrast (black is more intense, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we have up-close and personal experience with both the Nokia 7900 and the Nokia Arte, we can testify that the OLED displays sport some really nice color rendering. However, they are not as good in direct sunlight as all other transflective Nokia displays. It's a downside that we find inadequate and we would gladly stick to the excellent TFT displays used by Nokia up so far. Let's hope that the lower power consumption will make up for this con.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the N85 display looks in direct comparison to the Nokia 6210 Navigator display. Unfortunately, the light conditions make the differences not that easy to spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N85 has a 5 megapixel auto focus camera with Carl Zeiss optics and an active lens cover. Video recording is also commendable - VGA resolution at 30 fps seems enough for us, although point-and-shoot cameras are already taking it to the next level with HD recording, not to mention the high-speed videos of LG Viewty and LG Secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being said, the only downside we find in the camera department is the lack of a xenon flash. Instead the N85 has a dual LED flash and an auto-focus assist light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is snappy but there are no significant changes to the camera interface - GPS image geotagging is among the few novel features here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several camera samples - bear in mind that those were taken with a pre-release unit, so improvement of the image quality is to be expected.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N85 first impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N85 is an excellent performer with a full bag of features on board. It's got pretty much every modern feature there is and there are no obvious compromises made feature-wise. The N85 has left us with nothing but good impressions and we are looking forward to taking a final unit for a spin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N79 - a true chameleon<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N79 will probably make many early N78 adopters feel sorry about their buying decision - at roughly the same starting price you get a smartphone with a handful of new features such as a 5 megapixel camera with Carl Zeis optics and VGA@30fps video recording, as well as smart XpressOn covers and several other tidbits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design update is also a welcome change, since the Nokia N78 didn't exactly manage to win our hearts. Still, the good news for people looking forward to buying N78, is that its price will probably go down to a more reasonable level once the new N79 becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N82 will also feel the pressure by the N79 as they have pretty much the same feature set - the N79 outperforms it in several minor aspects except for the xenon flash. However, the Nokia N82 has a more attractive price tag than the N79 and that will probably allow it to keep its positions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N79 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design-wise, the Nokia N79 is much more attractive than the Nokia N78 and the keypad ergonomics are way better. Again, the 3.5mm audio jack is on the top along with an inconveniently placed keypad lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A most unusual solution is the combining of the microUSB port and the microSD memory card slot tightly together under a common protective cap. We guess that this arrangement may prove uncomfortable in some situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N79 also introduces for the first time the concept of smart XpressOn panels. The thing is that these panels have an embedded chip which stores the information of their color. You can clearly see the contacts of the chip on the panel. When you snap one of these panels on your N79, the interface theme changes automatically to match the panel color. It's not a practical feature that would influence your buying decision but still it's some fancy piece of refreshing novelty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the Nokia N79 will come with either a white or a grey back panel, but there will be two more in the retail package. And you can buy additional ones as retail accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera performance, the Nokia N79 is on par with every other 5 megapixel N-series handset. There are no changes to the camera user interface or features except for the GPS image geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, there is no xenon flash, but only a dual LED unit. The active lens cover is comfortable to use and it will certainly keep the lens well protected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several camera samples by Nokia N79. Of course image quality will be subject to improvement in the final retail version of the handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N79 first impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N79 seems like a great all-round device - it's got a feature set to match even the substantially more expensive Nokia N85 and it's also got the excellent performance of N78. So summing it up, the Nokia N79 will most probably make a great midrange buy somewhere around Christmas - be sure to watch out for it.</paragraph>
