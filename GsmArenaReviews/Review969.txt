			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView finally has a worthy successor - the Nokia Lumia 1020 is the culmination of Nokia's continuous efforts to redefine smartphone photography. The company was the first to launch a massive 41MP image sensor, do optical stabilization in a phone and use high-dynamic range mics and the Lumia 1020 has it all under one roof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go back in time. The Finns put proper zoom on a camera in the distant 2006 - the old N93 had 3x optical zoom. Years later the 808 PureView came around and did 3x lossless zoom without the complex optics. It did this with its huge (for a phone) 1/1.2" sensor. It also brought high-quality stereo sound capture by adding HAAC mics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> A trip down memory lane</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those crusty Symbians gave way to the Windows Phone 8-powered Lumia 920, which was the first phone with optical image stabilization. The OIS offers huge advantages for low-light photography, but the sensor was small and of relatively low 8.7MP resolution. There was no xenon flash either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 makes them all proud - it has the big sensor (even if, at 1/1.5", it's slightly smaller than the one inside the 808 PureView) the OIS and a proper flash, all garnished with a modern-looking smartphone OS. Here's the gist.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft and Nokia have been putting a great deal of effort to help Windows Phone mount a serious challenge to Android and iOS and make the smartphone game a three-horse race. And hero devices like the Lumia 1020 is what can really draw in the crowds, as they are getting stuff that's not available elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we wish the Lumia 1020 came out sooner, we're glad it's here and we are going to waste no time getting to know it better. The event is now over but we're working on a hands-on video, which we'll post later on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia brought out the big guns at the beginning of the presentation - two PhDs, who were involved in the creation of the Lumia 1020. And it seems that all that knowledge was needed as the team had to completely redesign the Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) that was introduced with the Lumia 920 to accommodate the far larger sensor. The new Nokia flagship uses the biggest Back-side illuminated (BSI) sensor in any consumer device and 6-lens optics from ZEISS (the most of any smartphone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a brief hands-on video of the Nokia Lumia 1020 and its original accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the presentation it seemed that the Nokia Lumia 1020 is all about photography - it's not just snapping photos, Nokia also wants to redefine how apps interact with camera. The star app, however, was the Pro Camera lens, which is how you make the best use of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 has a protruding camera on the back (unavoidable with such a big sensor), but overall it's not a huge device - in fact, (camera aside) the Lumia 1020 is 0.3mm thinner than the Lumia 920, with height and width being the same. And the camera bulge doesn't really damage the handling either - you hand is normally sitting lower so you don't really feel the extra thickness until you put the smartphone in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 is also lighter by 27g than its predecessor and that's a difference you can feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, let's jump straight to the camera, we know that's what you want to see. It protrudes ever so slightly from the back - honestly, with the 808 PureView in mind we thought it would be much worse. And yes, the sensor is a bit smaller here, but the OIS also adds quite a lot to the volume so kudos to Nokia for this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lives on a black circle that is separate from the rest of the back (and the phone's color). That circle houses the lens, which features a mechanical shutter, a xenon flash and a LED light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already noted the Lumia 1020 doesn't use the image sensor found in the 808 PureView. A completely new 41MP sensor was designed for this one. It's smaller than the previous sensor - 1/1.5" instead of 1/1.2" - and this means it has somewhat smaller pixels - 1.12 microns instead of 1.4 microns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the new sensor has a BSI design, which improves light sensitivity. This means it needs less light for the same image quality, so that probably makes up for the difference in size. And in case it's not enough, the new lens which are faster than the old ones (f/2.2 instead of f/2.4) will certainly do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Optical Image Stabilization (a completely redesigned mechanism) that also improves low-light photography and lets you produce smooth videos instead of the shaky mess that many other smartphones deliver. The xenon flash will give the Lumia 1020 an edge in the dark as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor can snap 34MP images in 16:9 mode and 38MP images in 4:3 mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all Windows Phone handsets, the Nokia Lumia 1020 has a dedicated shutter key. It's a two-position one, so the photography experience is as good as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia also announced an official Camera Grip - it improves your handling of the phone and adds a bigger shutter key. There's more - at the bottom of it is a standard tripod mount and Nokia demoed how that can be useful with some Gorillapods. The Grip also packs a 1,020mAh battery, which augments the 2,000mAh battery already in the device (for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has a 2,330mAh battery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera Grip is smaller than it looked in those leaked photo and turned out quite nice to handle. It will cost the somewhat steep $79, so we wouldn't be happy with anything less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no wireless charging built-in, Stephen Elop was asked about it on stage and said that after talking to consumers it seemed that a snap-on charging shell is the better option (adds thickness and weight only if you want wireless charging).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020 hands-on (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of user interface, it's mostly standard Windows Phone 8, but Nokia has added their exclusive twist - that includes the Nokia Glance screen, augmented reality apps based on HERE and, of course, free HERE+ worldwide navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More interesting is the Pro Camera lens. It snaps two photos at once - one full resolution and one oversampled 5MP photo that retains quite a lot of the original detail and is far easier to share. You can zoom in up to 3x for the 5MP photo without degrading the image quality (unlike digital zoom in other phones) and you don't have to make a decision on the spot - you can zoom out and in after the fact and even reframe the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app adds a number of manual controls too, using a ring-based interface not too different from what we saw on the Samsung Galaxy Camera. The settings you modify are kept at what you chose, while the others are adjusted automatically. Even focus can be adjusted manually for creative shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below is a video walkthrough of the Pro Camera app of the Nokia Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another trick that the phone does is long exposure - as long as 4 seconds. Elop and his team of PhDs demonstrated this by doing some light painting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording also makes use of OIS and oversampling. Zoom is enabled even during video capture and it can go up to 4x in 1080p mode and 6x in 720p resolution. The Nokia Lumia 1020 also has two mics (one on top, one on bottom) with the company's proprietary Rich Audio Recording for distortion-free sound recording in loud environments. The 1080p videos are recorded at 30fps, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned Nokia also wants to change apps - to that end, the company is releasing a new Imaging SDK that will let apps make full use of the 1020's advanced camera. The SDK also adds 50 effects, filters and enhancements and can make apps more efficient with a special Random Access JPEG tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, CNN will be adding zoom capabilities to its iReporter app. Hipstamatic's Oggl Pro adds a ton of effects to photos and you can post to Instagram (also Facebook and Twitter). Other apps to use the SDK are Vyclone, Yelp, Foursquare, Path, Vine and Flipboard (but no Instagram).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, all that aside, the Nokia Lumia 1020 is very close to the Lumia 925. It packs a 4.5" AMOLED screen of WXGA resolution (768 x 1280 pixels) with Super sensitive touch so you can wear gloves while using it. It's protected by Gorilla Glass 3, which has a nice smooth curve along its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 3.5mm audio jack and the microSIM card tray on top and the microUSB port, loudspeaker grill and lanyard eyelet at the bottom. Also the two mics are here, one on each side. There's no microSD card slot, but the phone comes with 32GB of built-in memory. We hear Telefonica will announce an exclusive 64GB version too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 will be available in White, Black and Yellow and we got to play with all three of them. This is Nokia's so-called non-painted polycarbonate, which keeps its color even if you scratch it. This makes scratches less visible and lets the smartphone preserve its looks longer.</paragraph>
