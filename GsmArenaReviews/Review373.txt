			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Recently we've got LG K920 for testing; this is one of the first 5MP camera GSM phones available on the market. We've decided that it's a good idea to test it against one of the best currently available 3MP camera phones, and also great rivals - Sony Ericsson K800 and Nokia N73.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The contestants: LG KG920, Nokia N73 and Sony Ericsson K800</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost six months ago we presented you photo samples from the most popular 3 megapixel camera phones - Nokia N73, Sony Ericsson K800 and Samsung D900. We haven't commented on the photo quality of the phones, because as you might have noticed the photos were not taken by us, but from our partners at Mobilmania.cz. It was very interesting for us to follow the comments of this article. Until now more than 880 comments have been posted on the subject. Although we haven't counted the scores, it seems that the preferences of our visitors are divided between Sony Ericsson K800 and Nokia N73, while Samsung D900 gets a relatively small percentage of fans. What's interesting is that most of the comments are quite extreme, like "Nokia sucks, Sony Ericsson is the best" or vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We, on other hand, just can't tell you which of the 3 megapixel shooters to choose. However it's more important for us to tell you what the differences are, so you can choose for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N73 produces over-saturated, over-sharpened, high-contrast photos. For the untrained eye these photos have more punch, more "wow" factor. When shooting a dull scene this approach produces more pleasant results. The problem comes when the scene is colorful and contrasty. Then the extra processing can lead to unnatural looking photos. It's quite ironic that Nokia N73 won its fans taking the idea of the so called "Sony colors" to extremes. Some years ago Sony used to boost the color saturation of their digital cameras as an extra advantage over their rivals. They don't do this anymore in their recent models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand Sony Ericsson K800 has more laid-back approach - the photos aren't over processed, which ensures better results if you are going to edit them later.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It's not fair<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Yes, it's not fair to compare 5 megapixels to 3 megapixels camera. However, we are doing it for you to see what the difference is and if an upgrade is worth it.It's tricky to compare photos with different resolution as in our case. To be able to compare apples to apples there are two approaches. The first one is to downsample the higher resolution photos to the lower resolution, but this will reduce the advantage of the higher resolution camera, and the amount of the sharpness applied in the post processing might be taken as a real ability to resolve detail. The other approach, the one we chose, is to upsample the lower resolution images to the higher resolution. This method shows about the same results you would get if you print the images. The con is that the jpeg artifacts get enlarged too, which is not fair to the lower resolution cameras, but this is a minor concern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing at actual 100% size the 5 megapixel photos and even the 3 megapixel ones just don't fit in the nowadays monitors. You usually see a small portion of the photo and scroll around. In this shootout we are taking a different approach. For all the photos we are showing you 1024x768 versions, downsampled in a special way. We've tried to eliminate as much as possible the difference in the sharpening applied in the camera processing. This downsampled photos can be used to evaluate the color and exposure accuracy or the dynamic range. To get however a correct presentation for the resolution of the cameras, you have to look at the crops on the right. As explained above, these are made by upsampling the K800 and N73 photos to 5 megapixels resolution and then cropping the same part of the image.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Studio shots<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This test was carried out under the same lighting conditions we use to make the photos for all our reviews. The scene is lit by white light sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 (full) ? Sony Ericsson K800 (full) ? Nokia N73 (full) ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KG920 shows at the same time better resolution, correct colors and lower noise levels. Although the phone manufacturers don't publish the specs for the sensor used in their camera phones, photos like this make us think that KG920 have a sensor with larger physical dimensions than the ones used in the phones, maybe this is the same sensor used in some low-level digital cameras. The colors of K800 are quite off (especially the green), while N73 has e serious problem with the yellow - the oversaturation sometimes comes at a price, look at the yellow cube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KG920 (full) ? Sony Ericsson K800 (full) ? Nokia N73 (full)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are sorry, that we can't show you crops for this image, because it was framed somewhat differently on the three phones, but we are showing you the full resolution images instead. Again, excellent results from LG KG920. Nailed color balance, lower noise than the rivals and amazing resolution. There is one more thing to note here - look at the highlights of paper clips. LG KG920 shows a lot better control of the highlights, the overexposed areas of the paper clips look more natural in KG920 photos. All in all - great macro results from the 5 megapixel contestant.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Outdoor photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 (full) ? Sony Ericsson K800 (full) ? Nokia N73 (full) ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing we notice on this set of photos is the yellowish cast of the KG920 photos. The resolution advantage is here, but it's not as pronounced as in the previous samples. Sony Ericsson K800 shows the most accurate colors. Nokia N73 has troubles with the high contrast scene this time - look at the arcs, they are overexposed and snow white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 (full) ? Sony Ericsson K800 (full) ? Nokia N73 (full) ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, let's look at the tree branches on this photo. Nokia N73 manages to show more resolution than K800 here and it's very close to KG920. Looking at how sharp the images from N73 are we start thinking that it just doesn't have a low-pass filter installed, or it's somehow tweaked. The low-pass filter exists in one form or another on almost all digital cameras; it improves the image quality in several ways, for example eliminating jagged edges, moiré and color shifting. The down side of the low-pass filter is that softens the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of the phones in the tests managed to get the colors of this scene right. The real colors looked somewhat like the result of Nokia N73, but a lot less saturated. In fact the colors of N73 are so much saturated that the train looks like it comes from an animation movie. LG KG920 shows again yellow cast, while the K800 results are slightly reddish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 ? Sony Ericsson K800 ? Nokia N73 ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 ? Sony Ericsson K800 ? Nokia N73 ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These two sets of images show almost exactly the same results as above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 ? Sony Ericsson K800 ? Nokia N73 ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the image from KG920 looks smoother than the 3 megapixel cameras, but we just can't find any real resolution advantage over them. Sony Ericsson K800 presents this scene better than Nokia N73 - it shows the correct colors and handles the highlights in a more natural way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 ? Sony Ericsson K800 ? Nokia N73 ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here again the Sony Ericsson K800 gets the colors right and shows about the same resolution as Nokia N73. LG KG920 gains some advantage over the previous image - it seems the closer the object, the better it performs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 ? Sony Ericsson K800 ? Nokia N73 ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KG920 shows good results here, you can see the resolution advantage in the crops. Both K800 and N73 shows also good results for their class, but look at the purple color between the branches in the Nokia N73 photo - maybe this sharpness comes at a price?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Indoors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>    LG KG920 (full) ? Sony Ericsson K800 (full) ? Nokia N73 (full) ? crops</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indoors, where the light is not that strong, LG KG920 has the chance to use it's larger sensor for a bigger advantage. Indeed its pictures look more like made from a digital camera, than from a phone. The yellow cast is here again, but it's normal in this environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's more interesting in this comparison is the Nokia N73 result - look at the holiday lights. In reality they are white, like on the photos of KG920 and K800. Nokia N73 however shows random colors in the lights. This again makes us think that Nokia N73 lacks a low-pass filter. Color artifacts like these in the small white objects, are usually caused by the lack of such filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see exactly the same here - these lights are white, Nokia N73 just loves to make the things colorful.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Using the flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG advertises the flash in KG920 as "strobe flash", which means that this is not the type of LED flash used in most of the mobiles phones. It's more like the xenon flash in Sony Ericsson K800, so we expected similar performance. Nokia N73 has standard LED flash only, so even on paper it can't compete with the others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KG920 ? Sony Ericsson K800 ? Nokia N73</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test was against a white wall from about one meter. Here KG920 shows the best results - the object is well lit and the color of the background is almost uniform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KG920 ? Sony Ericsson K800 ? Nokia N73</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second test is against a brick wall from about two meters in almost total darkness. For our surprise here the LG KG920 failed miserably. It seems that its flash was not as strong as the one of K800. Moreover KG920 doesn't boost the sensitivity in this situation to compensate for the insufficient light. In this scene even N73 delivers better results than KG920. So, if you want good results with KG920, make sure you shoot from close range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K800 wins by a small margin here. Nokia N73 is a smartphone and is expected to be slower, but in reality is not much slower than K800 in both focusing and saving times. The auto focus reliability is very high on both 3 megapixel cameras. LG KG920 disappointed us in this aspect. Yes, it should process a lot more data, as it works with larger photos, but the saving time was just too long. The auto focus is not that reliable as in the 3 megapixel photo mobiles and the shutter works somewhat strange - it you full-press from the beginning, you might not be able to take the photo. We should also note that the shot-to-shot time of KG920 is more than 10 seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we expected, in almost all of the test LG K920 showed better ability to resolve detail than it's 3 megapixel rivals. No surprises here. It also showed amazing macro capabilities and better dynamic range. What stops us from highly recommending it is the really slow performance and the yellowish tint on auto white balance outdoors. As for the Sony Ericsson K800 and Nokia N73 - they are equally good photo devices, but tuned differently. It's just a matter of preference - if you like your photos with more "wow" factor and never plan to edit them later, then your safe bet is Nokia N73. Otherwise, if you want your photos as accurate as possible and preserving as much detail for further editing, then you should go with Sony Ericsson K800.</paragraph>
