			<paragraph>The Prada phone by LG is among those handhelds that rely solely on touch-based as opposed to stylus-based interface interaction. The famous Apple iPhone surely started the craze over such devices, but the LG KE850, elsewhere known as the Prada phone, is nothing like iPhone. A highly stylish and versatile multimedia device, the Prada branded mobile is a true joy to the eye and represents the true meaning of a fusion between a full-featured mobile phone and a fashion icon. Impressive from the word go, the Prada phone will leave nothing but fascination in everybody around you. Our job is to delve deeper and see if it really has got what it takes to overrun the fashion mobile market by storm.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Practical, yet exclusively sophisticated with eyes on stylishness - those are some of the words that might describe the Prada phone. Its full market name in fact is "Prada phone by LG" which in fact means that the Prada comes before LG in this duo. Initially the handset was named "LG Prada phone" but obviously tables have turned in the opposite direction. As far as the LG portfolio is concerned the devices carries the unobtrusive model designation LG KE850. So don't be bewildered as we use all these names throughout our review - we have only one device in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada phone is truly unique and thus has no direct competitors. With its touch-based user interface it outranks all current fashion mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to product packaging LG already have a tradition of offering their products in high-quality retail packages that are visually attractive as the handsets themselves. The LG Prada phone makes no difference to that rule. The Prada phone retail box is a black cube and the contents are positioned on different levels inside the box.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The accessories that come with the handset are equally attractive. Besides the headset which has a standard 3.5 mm audio jack adapter, allowing you to listen to music on your favorite headphones, the retail package also includes a 256MB microSD memory card, a data cable and a stylish hard leather case.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Out-of-the-box experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, the Prada phone is nothing less than a spectacular piece of technology. It measures 98.8 x 54 x 12 mm and weighs the meager 85 g. The whole handset is made out of a matt black plastic with silver framing which is made out of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large touch screen display is the centerpiece in this work of technological art. It measures a good 3 inches in diagonal and supports up to 262K colors in a WQVGA (400 x 240 pixels) resolution. The original PRADA theme doesn't seem to take full advantage of the rich colors. But rest assured, there are full color interface themes, too. Above the display there is the PRADA insignia and the loudspeaker grill and below it are three control keys - the two receiver keys plus a Back key in the middle. This middle key is so small that it's hardly noticeable but proves rather comfortable in everyday use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Display is not black and white ? PRADA insignia ? the three control keys</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Prada phone incorporates two control keys. The first one is a multimedia key that after a short key press activates the MP3 player and after a longer press starts the camera. When the camera is on it serves as a shutter key. The second key is the key lock. It locks the touch sensitivity of the display to prevent accidental key presses. Of course, automatic key lock is also available. In the upper right corner you may also notice a hole for attaching a neck or wrist strap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Right side view: MP3/camera key and keylock key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity port of the Prada phone is located on the left side. It has a plastic cap which blends with the metallic silver framing. You can use the port for plugging the charger, the data cable or headset (headset adapter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Left side view ? connectivity port ? plugging in a peripheral</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the connectivity port, the left side of body includes also a dual volume key and a sound profiles shortcut key. The sound profiles key allows you to quickly change between different ringing modes - silent, ringing with or without vibration, etc. LG handsets don't have a full profile support as you've used to see on Sony Ericsson and Nokia handsets ? with detailed settings and all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Additional left keys: volume and sound profiles key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Prada phone is pretty bare and doesn't feature any control elements. The same holds true for the bottom side too with the exception of a key for releasing the battery cover. Right next to the cover release button there is a little microphone aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Prada phone top and bottom sides</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Prada phone is the only place on the body where you will notice the LG branding. The camera lens is located in the top left corner along with a self-portrait mirror and the LED flash. They are placed on a stylish brushed metal plate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Prada phone back panel ? LG branding ? 2 megapixel camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is easily removed after you release it with the abovementioned release key. The LGIP-A750 Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 800 mAh is hidden below it. According to the manufacturer, the battery should sustain the handset for up to 300 hours in standby mode and up to 3 hours in constant talking. Now we weren't able to measure the battery life correctly since we used the handset heavily during our tests but under a moderate everyday usage you would probably need to charge the Prada phone every two days or so. The SIM card bed is located above the battery while the memory card slot is buried even deeper - being under the SIM card slot itself. You would have to take out the battery in order to take out the memory card which is a bit of a nuisance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ergonomics all the way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were pretty pleased with the ergonomics of the LG Prada phone both in terms of the hardware and in terms of the software. The handset fits great in your hand and the weight and form factor add for a really nice user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Prada phone by LG held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Capacitive Touch Screen Technology utilized in the creation of the LG Prada touchscreen display makes use of a glass panel with a capacitive (charge storing) material coating. When you touch the display the change in frequency allows the circuits situated in the corners to calculate the coordinates of your touch and thus the controller "knows" exactly what item you've touched on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The positives are that you get a durable touchscreen panel that is not affected by accumulated dirt and liquids plus the added benefit of high image clarity. Unfortunately, you have to use your fingers only; the screen cannot react to the touch of a stylus. But that provides for a nice "hands-on" experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we tested the LG Prada in bright sunlight the display remained visible with almost no negative impact on usability. However, when it comes to performance under direct sunlight, we've seen much better displays by Nokia, which according to us leads the way in that respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark the display performed great and we were more than happy with the adjustable brightness levels that allowed for comfortable experience in the dark. Two of the three control keys have backlighting of their own, but it stays on for much shorter time than the one of the display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dial on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, using the Prada phone as a regular calling handset proved easy enough. We are pretty comfortable with it making and receiving calls. The sound during conversations is nice and clear and we had no problem with the network signal either. The only downside to its user friendliness is that the ringer loudspeaker is a bit on the quiet side. You probably won't be able to hear it ringing in a noisy street. The problem is furthermore deepened by the default ringing style - ascending, which means that the handset will gradually reach the preset ringing volume starting from really quiet. That may easily lead to the other calling party hanging up on you before you've even realized that the phone rings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During calls you don't have to worry about touching some items on the touch sensitive display with your cheek or ear, because the display gets turned off during calls.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: designed to amaze<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the LG Prada phone is based on Flash technology and is definitely something new to the mobile market. Bear in mind that Flash doesn't mean that there is an underlying OS or something - the LG Prada mobile is not a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we see here is a rather simple menu system - simple, but sophisticated enough to impress. Ergonomics and user-friendliness are at their heights - almost every user, from the simpleton to the tech buff, can learn to operate it with equal ease in a matter of minutes. LG have made a really nice job in designing the user interface system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User interface, themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the top of the standby screen there is info about the battery status, current profile and signal strength. The network carrier's name can be turned off as in most LG phones. Somewhere in the middle of the standby screen there is a floating clock that can be moved around with a finger. The clock can be analogue, digital or even dual clock displaying the time in two selected time zones. A single tap on the clock brings out the Alarms flag which allows you to setup an alarm straight from the standby screen - comfortable enough, we would say.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the bottom of the screen there is a navigation row of shortcuts. Unfortunately, the available four shortcuts are not user configurable. The first shortcut takes you to the main menu, the second opens the Dial pad for you to dial a number, the third opens the messages submenu and the last one opens the Contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standby screen ? Alarms flag ? Setting the alarm from the standby screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the main menu consists of four submenus - they are displayed in a column on the right of the screen. They don't have names but the first one contains elements related to making calls, sending messages and browsing the Web. The second one is the Entertainment part which houses the media files, the camera, the FM radio and the games. The third submenu includes organizer applications such as the Calendar, the Calculator, the Unit converter, etc. And finally, the fourth item takes care of all settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG Prada main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the user interface comes in the well-known black and white theme. In fact it's more of a black, white and grey theme. Although it's really stylish, the theme doesn't take full advantage of the 256K color display as grey grades are not smooth and look more as if the display is monochrome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other three UI themes are another matter entirely - they come full-colored with nice-looking icons. One of them offers a butterfly which flies around the standby screen, while another one visualizes a fish swimming on your display. In either case touching the display in standby mode makes them come to your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG Prada color themes - the standby screen ? Color icons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the wallpaper on the welcome screen too. The wallpapers that come with the LG Prada are nice and stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some of the preinstalled wallpapers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have liked it if it was possible to navigate through the menu with help of the side volume keys, but obviously LG have decided to make users touch their way around as much as possible. Another thing that we certainly would have welcomed is an additional way to provide feedback to the user on a finger press besides the touch tone. For example a weak vibration on every press would have been great.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A nice little list (or not so little)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Contacts list offers much the same function as any ordinary phonebook. The contacts capacity is 1000 contacts which is more than enough. The phonebook allows the storing of 4 numbers /mobile, home, office, fax/ and an email. Further on the contact can be included into a caller group or can be assigned a picture and a personal ringtone. You can add a text note to the contact, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contacts list ? Editing a contact: various fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is performed through gradual typing of a name's characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Searching the contact list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has several preinstalled caller groups which can be customized. Besides a dedicated ringtone, each caller group has its icon but it doesn't appear in front of the respective members' names in the contacts list, as it did in all previous LG models. That really makes the icons thing pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Contact list caller groups</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Contact lists shows phone and SIM contacts together in one list which may mean that you have to delete all duplicating names. Not a very thoughtful solution by LG.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The call records can be accessed from the Dial pad, from the main menu or by pressing the left hardware call key. There are four tabs in the Call history - all, missed, dialed and received calls. If you open the Call History item from the main menu though, you will also find information about the call charges and the data counter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Call records</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call History has a nice feature that is rarely seen elsewhere in the user interface. As soon as you open the lists, two semi-transparent Up/Down arrows appear. You can scroll through the lists by using the side scrollbar or you can just press the arrows - they make scrolling a lot easier and it is a real shame that they have not been implemented throughout the whole user interface where scrolling is required.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Texting is a tricky business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports the sending and receiving of SMS, MMS and email messages. The messaging submenu has separate options for starting a SMS, MMS and email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A much discussed feature of the Prada phone is actually typing messages without a hardware keypad. Well, it's not that fast? At least in the beginning it isn't. The hardest thing is the lack of a positive feedback when you press a virtual key. The message typing is assisted by T9. Using it is a good idea to speed up typing. As you would see on the screenshots there are several semi-transparent arrows. They allow you to move the cursor to the left and right. Pressing the cross in the center turns the arrows from horizontal to vertical ones which would allow you to move the cursor vertically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messaging menu ? Typing a message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing text message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is that if you have started a new message and all of a sudden you have to cancel its typing, it's saved automatically as a draft and next time you decide to start a new message the phone automatically opens that draft for you to continue typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature is that the phone keeps a record of the last numbers you have sent messages to and when sending a new one you can choose among them instead of digging down in the full contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports the POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP protocols and as regards sending and receiving text emails it successfully does it job as we managed to find out during the test period. As regards emails with file attachments, the maximum size for one sent or downloaded message is 300KB. A good thing is that there is an option to provide a separate username and password for the SMTP server. Unfortunately the email client doesn't have support for SSL encrypted connection which is the standard for secure email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another flaw with the email client is that although the display is large, it doesn't fit a lot of text lines so using the email client will be comfortable only for a few short messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The email inbox</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KE850 has only 8MB of integrated memory and a microSD memory card slot. The handset comes with a 256MB card in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager appears as a My stuff item. It includes separate factory preset folders for different multimedia content. In fact these folders are the only one you will see since the file manager doesn't actually support user-created folders. You can create such folders using the computer and the USB cable of course, but they do not get listed in the My Stuff menu. You can mark, copy or move files only within the designated multimedia group. For example you cannot copy image files to the music folder. Then again you can of course copy or move files to the external memory or send them through Bluetooth connection and for all of those options you can rely on multiple marking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The My Stuff menu item</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada phone also has office document viewer functionality. It's a rather innovative feature for a non-OS mobile phone. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports MS Word documents, MS Excel files and PDF files. However, scrolling through a document is an unpleasant experience since the scrolling itself is way to slow and moves through the document in small steps only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Opening a Word document, a PDF document, and an Excel document </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking, the file browser of the LG KE850 Prada provides basic functionality and when it comes to browsing pictures pretty much the same holds true. Picture files can be browsed in thumbnail or list view. Thumbnail browsing is rather slow as it has always been with LG mobiles. When you open a selected picture, thumbnails of the rest of the pictures are available for you to scroll through right under the currently open image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browsing pictures in thumbnail view and in filmstrip view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view pictures fullscreen and you can even browse them in this mode with the help of semi transparent arrows that appear on the screen. Zooming on the pictures is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Browsing pictures in landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada phone offers a nice looking MP3 player and the handset itself has a Flight mode which really makes it an adequate solution as a portable music player. Unfortunately, you are not able to filter tracks in any way. All you are left with is a playlist with all your available tracks. There are no equalizer settings that you can use in order to enhance the player sound - strangely enough though there is a "Normal" sign in the upper left corner. Maybe future software versions will have an equalizer added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    MP3 player menu ? MP3 player interface ? Adjusting volume ? White skin</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize MP3 files in separate subfolders under the Sounds folder but although you would be able to play them directly, unfortunately the MP3 player won't recognize their presence and won't load them in the general playlist. When you play them directly you get a somewhat degraded version of the player which can play all the files in the folder but won't play in background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio works fine too and the auto scan discovers available stations pretty reliably. You can fine tune a radio station. Maybe the only two downsides to it are the limited slots for storing radio stations (only 12) and the lack of RDS while in the same time you cannot assign names to the saved stations. Well, it can't be run in the background either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MP3 player and the FM radio both sound nice and loud enough with the retail headset. Sound quality is a pretty subjective thing but if we are talking about bass elements, we found the retail headset to be on par with the Altec Lansing AHS423 which we had at hand and that is pretty enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of the Prada phone is really nice and you can watch videos in fullscreen landscape mode with or without semi-transparent overlay controls.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Focusing on? the camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada phone is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with auto focus and a Scheider-Kreuznach certified lens. The maximum picture resolution is 1600x1200 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera speed, the Prada is the fastest LG phone we've reviewed so far - it takes around 8 seconds to focus, take a picture at the maximum resolution and save it as compared to 9 seconds in LG KE970 Shine and 10 seconds in LG KE800 Platinum. The auto focusing itself is slower than in previous models? It takes 4 seconds to focus on a subject as compared to 2 seconds in LG KE970 Shine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Prada camera viewfinder with and without overlay controls</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is also equipped with a LED flash which is there to help you in poor light conditions. For our disappointment it is too weak. It's effective from a really close distance only. In fact the LED is usable only for macros, as you can see from our samples. Speaking of poor light conditions, the camera of the KE850 doesn't have a night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera menu offers options such as picture resolution, brightness level, white balance that has several presets according to the available light conditions, and some color effects such as sepia, black &amp; white, negative, etc. Beside the regular Single shot mode the camera can also capture images in Multi shoot mode which takes 3 or 6 pictures in a quick succession. A new setting is the option to view the viewfinder in either 4:3 or 16:9 screen ratio. The 16:9 setting fills the entire screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Some of the camera options ? shutter tones cannot be turned off</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera user interface, photo settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada camera photos don't have any EXIF information that may help a photo enthusiast determine what went wrong with a certain picture or setup. The quality of the 2 megapixel autofocus camera depends a lot on the lighting conditions. The outdoor photos are not bad, but we noticed a tendency for over-sharpening plus the colors on most of the photos look way too intensive (high saturation). Indoor photos turned out very good, but only when taken during the day. But if you resize the images to a smaller resolution you are almost sure to get some great looking samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although there isn't a dedicated macro mode, we were pleasantly surprised by the macro shots - the camera can focus from really close distance and capture really fine details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a simple conclusion, as with all LG fashion mobiles the LG Prada phone can't compete with Sony Ericsson K750 and company. The overall quality of the LG Prada camera can be compared to the LG Shine for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                LG Prada sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Unimpressive flash performance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera captures video in the maximum WQVGA resolution of 400 x 240 pixels which is in fact the wide-screen version of QVGA (320 x 240 pixels). The output files format is the usual 3GP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Video camera options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the menu of the video camera is pretty much the same as the one we already described for the still camera with few exceptions. The camera offers both limited and unlimited video recording.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plug it in?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features full USB support and the LG USB cable comes along in the retail box along with the phone itself. The great thing about the USB support of the phone is that when connected, the phone memory and the memory card both appear in the Windows explorer as removable drives just as your regular USB flash drive would with no special drivers needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you receive a call while in mass storage mode, the call will be rejected but after you disconnect the handset, you will see the information about any missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> USB connection established</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need any other type of synchronization between the phone and the PC like for items such as the phonebook and the schedule you should use the dedicated LG software LG Mobile Sync that comes on CD along with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As much as connectivity is concerned, the phone features 3-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE 900/1800/1900, as well as Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser that the Prada phone is equipped with offers some really basic features but it's able to open full HTML pages. It doesn't feature zoom and landscape mode. When browsing web pages the touchscreen functionality doesn't work over the pages themselves and you have to use the arrows in the bottom of the screen for navigation. As you can see from the screenshot, only half of the screen is actually used to display the web page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Personal manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward, it offers a monthly view and you can navigate along the dates with your finger. A large orange square denotes the current date and when you touch a date, a popup appears above your finger so that you can see what's under it. As with several previous LG handsets the first day of the week is Sunday and there is no option for changing that to Monday. Adding an event is made really simple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calendar ? Adding an event</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Memos feature that allows for storing some notes. Each note can have a maximum of 200 characters. The Prada phone also has an Alarm clock, a Calculator, a Unit converter and a World time clock. The Alarm clock allows for setting only one alarm, which can be repeated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Typing a memo ? Setting the alarm ? Setting alarm repetitions</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is really nicely designed and when you touch a virtual key a popup above your finger let's you know which key you are pressing. As with most LG mobiles the Calculator offers two modes - a regular calculator and a scientific one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calculator: basic and scientific modes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Unit Converter also has a nice list of units such as Currency, Area, Length, Weight, Temperature, Volume, and Velocity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Unit converter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Time application is among the nicest we've seen - it really manages to please the eye. We saw the same one used in LG KE970 Shine. It features nice graphics and animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  World Time application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Calendar, calculator, world time</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG Prada phone has support for Java MDIP 2.0 so you can install third party Java applications to suit your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play some more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone we tested had four preinstalled games - Halloween Fever, Photo Puzzle, Virus and Pipe. In the Halloween Fever you have to annihilate similar objects by moving them next to each other. The Photo Puzzle is pretty self-explanatory. In the Virus game you have to terminate viruses by touching them with your finger before they contaminate healthy cells. The Pipes game is a highly popular one too - you have to rearrange different pipe segments in order for the water to flush all the way to the sewers. Presumably you can install additional games but their compatibility with the touchscreen navigation is arguable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, this review is closing to its end. The Prada phone by LG is a fascinating device and we enjoyed reviewing it. Sometimes experiments turn out to be less impressive and less successful than they might have been expected. This is surely not the case with the LG Prada phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sophistication made simple is the most appropriate tagline that would best describe the concept of this highly fashionable and highly expensive handset. Almost everything about it is made as simple as it can get, while at the same time it is a revolutionary step as compared to joystick or D-pad operated handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada phone by LG is surely a quick winner in the fashionable market segment and it comes with a price tag to match it. If you don't mind the lack of 3G and you are not much into web surfing from your handheld you would be delighted at what this baby can offer you - a killer fashion statement plus the enjoyment of using a state-of-the-art technological achievement.</paragraph>
