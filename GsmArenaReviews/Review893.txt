			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The China-bound Sony Xperia C could be the right opportunity to smuggle some big-screened, quad-core goodness into markets where those things usually fetch a high price. It's certainly the right size too. Five-inchers don't necessarily have to come with high-end price tags. There's demand for affordable options too, which the Xperia C isn't the first to address. Sony has obviously been watching the Samsung Galaxy Grand, while HTC and LG aren't indifferent either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Sony Xperia C has dual-SIM support, which is almost a must-have in the markets Sony's interested in, a massive 5-inch display and a quad-core processor. So far, so good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is the company's first smartphone powered by a MediaTek chipset. Sony has so far always opted for either Snapdragons or (when the company still existed) ST Ericsson but, with China being the primary target market, it had little choice really. The latest MediaTek chips support both dual-SIM and quad-core processors, and they are light on the wallet too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Affordability is, of course, an important reason, considering Asian markets are teeming with sub-$200 quad-core droids and competition is fierce. The likes of Lenovo, Micromax, Xolo, and many more, are ready to offer a big enough screen and decent feature set on a bargain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means is the Sony Xperia C should be preparing for a full-scale war. Let's check the ammo:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C obviously didn't remain confined within Asian boundaries as various European retailers are already shipping it at very attractive prices. It sure isn't the fastest or the most feature-rich of phones, but it sounds like a great bang for your hard-earned buck. Will that be enough to probably forgive the lower resolution screen and the other potential deal breakers?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will find out soon enough. Jump over to the next page to see what's in the Xperia C's retail box and what the smartphone is really made of.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Xperia C<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C comes in an slim box, all the accessories placed in their separate and removable compartments. The contents are nothing out of the usual: an A/C adapter, microUSB cable, a white headset and some leaflets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia C 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C has pretty much the same footprint as Sony's Z1 flagship. At 141.5 x 74.2 x 8.9mm, the handset weighs 153g, which is 17g less than the Xperia Z1, due to the all-plastic build of the Xperia C.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What we're looking at is yet another issue of the OmniBalance design that premiered on the Xperia Z early this year. It has been the signature styling of the entire Xperia lineup since, covering the entire price, size and performance range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the rear cover is removable, the Xperia C still looks like a unibody phone and one that closely resembles the Xperia ZR. The few metallic elements along the sides make pleasant accents - a prominent element of the Xperia line's styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping the design consistent across the entire range isn't a Sony invention but we like it how even their low-to-midrange devices don't look cheap. Perhaps a thing or two for Samsung to learn there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C's entire front is occupied by the massive 5" TFT screen with no hardware controls whatsoever, and bezels that could've been slimmer. Even with those, the Xperia C is still the same size as the top-of-the-line Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The breathing LED is discretely hidden beneath the glass just below the screen. It illuminates a tiny slit that grows thinner at the edges and looks quite pleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C is a well-built phone. The removable rear panel doesn't bend or squeak, and the handset has an almost unibody look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is big though and those bezels don't help either. The same size as the Xperia Z1, and a few grams lighter, it's slim enough to easily slip into pockets but its presence will always be felt. The phone is reasonably comfortable to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C has a 5" LCD display of qHD resolution (540 x 960) for a decent, if hardly spectacular, 220ppi sharpness. The Samsung Galaxy Grand stretches its WVGA resolution far thinner and while there are some 720p options in the class, qHD is not a disadvantage here. There is no special anti-scratch surface over the screen and no special coating either, so the screen is very prone to fingerprints and not easy to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering looks okay, but the white balance is on the cold side meaning there is a subtle bluish tint. Typical for Sony smartphones, viewing angles are not impressive at all, with visible loss of contrast and color shift when you are not looking at the screen head on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen matrix of the Xperia C next to the Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall image quality is certainly good for the class, although we noticed strange behavior with its brightness settings. We measured the display's brightness levels and as it turned out that actual 50% brightness is achieved when the slider is set at about 75% and when you set it in its half-way position the brightness is under a quarter of the maximum available. That's why the screen looks dim most of the time, unless you keep it close to the maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usually we did our battery test on 50% of the dedicated brightness slider and you should have that in mind when you are looking at its scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front display glass is quite reflective too, making the screen hard to read in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the earpiece is above the screen beneath a silver metallic grille. The VGA front camera is on the right, along with the proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the earpiece grille is a tiny status LED that lights up orange when you are charging the phone (or you are running out of battery) and green once your battery is fully charged. There is also a notification light below the display, which blinks on missed events. Neither of those LEDs is user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone is below the screen beneath another metallic grille and there is no chance of accidentally muting it with a finger during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is where all the physical buttons are - starting with the aluminum Power/Lock key (a signature element of the OmniBalance design), the volume rocker (small, plastic but still easy to use) and the hardware shutter key (also made of plastic). Shutter keys are always welcome but this one in particular could've had better feedback - in either half or full press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Xperia C only features the 3.5mm audio jack, while only thing of interest on the left is the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet is at the bottom of the phone - you'll need to open the back cover to attach the strap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back is the 8MP camera with LED flash and the metallic loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover fits tightly in place and can be quite hard to open - we had to almost twist the phone, so be careful the first couple of times you are trying to do this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the back cover off, you can access the two SIM beds and and the microSD card slot. Unlike other dual-SIM Xperia smartphones, the Xperia C offers 3G connectivity only on its primary SIM card. You can use both SIMs for internet connectivity, though you'll have to rely on EDGE speeds if you opt to use the card in the secondary SIM bed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery Life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony put a 2390mAh battery inside the Xperia C. We ran the handset through our battery routine, making sure to have two SIM cards in. It scored 68 hours, which means you'll only need to charge the smartphone every 3 days if you use it for an hour each of talk-time, web browsing and playing video per day. Quite an impressive result indeed and possible because of the low-consumption Cortex-A7 processor cores and the fact that the screen brightness is actually at less than a quarter of its maximum level when the slider is set to 50%.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.2.2 in charge of operations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C comes with Android 4.2.2 out of the box and Sony's proprietary Xperia launcher on top. There is no official info on if and when the Xperia C will be getting a newer Android version though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Sony Xperia C to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C gives you the option to add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background for the virtual on-screen buttons is black when you are running an app and completely transparent when you are browsing homescreen panes and menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area or using the pinch-to-zoom gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The widgets in the Xperia C do resize and re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applying a new theme changes the lockscreen and homescreen wallpaper and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.). Depending on the color you've chosen the hidden LED light below the screen will light up with the same color tone on notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are four docked shortcuts (two each side of the app drawer shortcut). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items, in which case you get smaller icons of the first four shortcuts in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The rightmost pane is special and fires up the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other panes can accommodate various widgets: Email, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, TrackID and Digital clock. You can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is on, the lockscreen will display the music controls by default, but they can be swiped out of the way. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles - a dedicated SIM card switch (for calls and messages only, not data), Sound, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. If you have just one SIM card inserted, the SIM card switch is replaced with a Mobile data on/off toggle. There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles are non-customizable and just like on the Samsung's TouchWiz launcher, you can access all available toggles via a two-finger swipe from the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. You can also search and even uninstall apps from the dedicated menu. If you tap and hold on an app, a green Add to Homescreen field will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon and drop it there and you will go back to your homescreen and place a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock Android task manager is onboard. It lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe. The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calendar, Gmail, Notes, and Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or you have the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one Small App at a time (unlike the high-end Xperia phones) due to the limited amount of RAM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now is ready to serve you<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and it can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of Google Now (November 2013) will allow you to have short dialogues with the app AI when you are conducting searches. In these dialogues, Google Now should be able to understand when you referring to your search term by an indirect pronoun instead of using its full name. It will also answer back when there are several options for action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another perk of the new version is that you can now activate the Google Now voice commands handsfree by simply starting with a "Ok, Google" instead of pressing the Mic button. This however, should only work in US locales.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now now also taps into the crowd-sourced real-time traffic information by Waze - a popular smart navigation app project that Google purchased earlier this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget for the homescreen or lockscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C is Sony's first device we meet running on the MediaTek's best quad-core chispet. It is powered by a quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 low-powered processor, with PowerVR SGX544 graphics and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cortex-A7 processor clocked at 1.2GHz delivers a decent mid-range performance very close to the Cortex-A9 chips, with the added benefit of lower power consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first test is all about single-core performance, where the Xperia C scored similar results to most of the Cortex-A9-powered competitors.

JRGRAPH_EXPANDABLE_VERSION = false;

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, we put all four cores to the test in the multi-core version of the Linpack benchmark. The Sony Xperia C either had some problems with the test or it is just that bad. Anyway its score is almost identical to the quad-core LG Optimus 4X HD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also run the GeekBench 3 CPU benchmark. The Xperia C matched the score of the Oppo R819, which is powered by the same MT6589 chipset, both occupying bottom spots in our chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 4 gauges the overall device performance instead of just the CPU and the Sony Xperia C managed to output half the scores of the top Snapdragon 800 chips. The Quadrant test does the same as AnTuTu, but the Xperia C fell in the bottom of our chart there among the quad-core Crotex-A9 droids.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's time to test the PowerVR SGX544 graphic processing unit. We ran both GLBenchmark tests in off-screen mode, testing raw GPU power. The Xperia C fell at the bottom of our charts, which means the PowerVR SGX544 GPU is the weaker among all 2013 chipsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran Epic Citadel benchmark on the Ultra High Quality setting. Here the Xperia C showed even though its GPU may be struggling to handle 1080p screens, the PowerVR SGX544 graphic chip offers nicely playable framerates on the qHD resolution display. And a strong case can be made that this is what actually counts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance of the Sony Xperia C's Chrome browser is is quite decent, matching the Snapdragon S4 quad-core gang.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combined BrowserMark 2 benchmark results were also a match for the Samsung flagships from 2012.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Xperia C placed near the bottom of the chart in the Vellamo browser benchmark, but its score is actually quite close to those in front.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C might not be the benchmark beast geeks would dream about, but it's not underpowered by any means. The MT6589 is powerful enough to provide fast, fluid and lag-free performance on the qHD resolution of Xperia C and will handle well every app and game out there. And in this price range, this is more than enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C phonebook is uses a tabbed interface - the Groups, Contacts, and Favorites tabs can be side-swiped. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a dedicated tab in the Dialer as well, though Groups and Favorites tabs are not available in the Dialer app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show up as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contact feature is present alright - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact, visiting their web page or navigating to their home address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C supports dual standby, meaning that both of its SIM cards can accept calls at any time (just not simultaneously). Unfortunately, probably due to chipset limitations, the Xperia C supports 3G networks only on its primary SIM. You can still use the second SIM for date, but you'll have to rely on EDGE connectivity at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another thing you should know too - while you are in a call with one of the SIMs, the other card will be inaccessible. By default the phone automatically forwards your calls to the other SIM card and if it supports call waiting, you should be able to get the call or put it on hold (additional charges might apply if you take the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you can use only one of your cards for network data transfers and you'll have to set that from the dedicated Dual SIM settings menu. From there you can also set names for the SIM cards, choose the default one for calls and messages, turn on/off SIMs, and turn on/off the auto-switch options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can quickly switch the default SIM card for messaging and calls via the dedicated widgets or the SIM toggle in the notification area, though - you don't need to go to the settings menu every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The signal strength is relatively strong and we had no issues with in-call quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app features smart dialing which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list. You can hide the keypad the make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Xperia C automatically disables the touchscreen when you place it next to your face during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia C, and it scored an Average mark, which means you'll rarely miss calls or notifications. The test was made using the xLOUD option, which is active by default. You'd do well to stick with that as otherwise the speaker was too quiet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, which noticeably made the sound louder, and then with both xLOUD and ClearPhase on, which sacrificed some of the loudness for improved audio quality. So if you want to squeeze the maximum of your speaker, you'll need just to keep the xLOUD option on and the other sound enhancements - off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS. Four shortcuts at the bottom of the screen handle the most common cases - an image, a photo, a doodle (you draw with your finger) and your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox for all your email accounts. It supports batch operations and has a Preview pane option in landscape mode - the list of emails goes on the left, the contents of the currently selected email on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is the default app that handles instant messaging (Facebook is preinstalled, but Facebook Messenger isn't). Since its latest update it can also handle SMS and MMS messaging - Google's attempt at unifying all messaging services and while the initial release has some quirks that need ironing, it looks to be a promising platform. If you like it, you can set is as a default app for your SMS messaging too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia C offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is unsurprisingly comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable bilingual word suggestions, symbols on long press, the Google voice typing key and the smiley key. All these options are disabled by default.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller, either with a pinch gesture or a sideways swipe. The whole thing is very responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second tab here, My Albums, which includes online albums (Facebook, Picasa) along with albums stored on devices in the local network. Also here are some special albums - Maps and Globe, which use the geo-tagging info to display photos where they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled. The gallery also offers an integrated image editor with rich functionality - add styles, filters, text, doodles, stamps, frames, effects, and crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LED strip below the display lights up with different color (similar with the image on the screen) every time you scroll through the pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get the latest version of Google's default Photos app (the default gallery app in Android 4.4 KitKat). Upon opening the app you'll see two tabs - Camera and Highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera is a grid of your photos and videos, three on a line. The very first thumb is marked as Folders and will return you a step back to the old Album view, where you can choose to open a different album. The Gallery will always open the Camera album by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Highlights tab has all of your Picasa and Google+ online photos. The Google Photo automatic upload is integrated in the new Gallery app. If you turn it on, your photos will be automatically uploaded to your Google+ profile, but won't be shared with others unless you do it manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a single photo you'll get three shortcuts below the image - Edit, Share and Delete. That's it. The Editor allows you to crop, rotate or add filters to your photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has a few hidden goodies that we almost missed. There is a hidden navigation menu pane that is revealed with a swipe from the edge of the screen anywhere in the gallery. You can easily switch Google+ accounts from there, go to Albums, Videos, Photos you are tagged in, all Google+ photos or even the deleted photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an Auto Awesome section. It is something like a smart gallery that combines similar photos and videos in a cool way - it either exports a collage picture or a motion gif. If you like the combination the gallery has made for you, there is a dedicated shortcut to save the new picture in the gallery. Awesome, indeed!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent video player lacks AC3 audio codec<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C didn't experience any difficulties playing 720p and 1080p videos. It loaded them pretty swiftly. AVI, MP4, DivX, X264, MOV, MKV and XviD files played without a glitch, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While that's certainly an option, you lose the Gracenote features - the Movies app always plays videos (or tries to, anyway) with its own player rather than what you've set as system default.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The updated Walkman music player, which is present on all 2013-Xperia smartphones is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has more options for sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's the familiar ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However dedicated audiophiles might want to consider alternatives off the Play Store, with support for a 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RGB notification light below the screen will change to match the album art of the currently playing song (you can disable this if you don't like it).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is decent but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C did fairly well in the first part of our audio output quality test. When plugged into an active external amplifier the smartphone posted very good to excellent scores all over, even though it didn't break any records. Volume levels were low, though, which was somewhat disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you plug in a pair of headphones, the Xperia C lets a rather hard to detect amount of distortion creep, while its stereo crosstalk worsens but still remains decent. The rest of the readings remain very good, but the volume levels drop even more in this case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 8MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can start snapping away or shoot a video without the need to change modes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia C camera offers all kinds of features, including HDR mode, Sweep panorama face detection, geo-tagging and touch capture. Scenes and picture effects are available too. The effects split the screen into nine segments and show a live preview of each of the nine effects, but it's a little laggy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does. You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but it is also useful for when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Sony Xperia C photos is decent, if unspectacular. The dynamic range is low and the photos often have their highlights blown. Colors are good and the white balance is right most of the time. The resolved detail isn't that great for an 8MP camera, but it will do for most of the people anyways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available too, helping you bring extra dynamic range to both the shadows and highlight areas of your shot. It captures even less find detail though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C goes into our photo compare tool in the category of 8MP. It does OK on the charts and the resolved detail in close range is definitely better.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video is high on bitrate, low on quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C is capable of capturing 1080p video footage at steady 30fps. You can also capture 2MP stills white capturing videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video bitrate of 17-18Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 132 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results are pretty good and definitely better than we expected. There's enough fine detail, but things look a little pixelated (this could be the effect of poor image sampling). There is lots of noise too. This time around the continuous auto-focus behave well and won't be bothering you as on other Xperia phones. Here's a sample for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a 1080p@30fps sample for direct download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C has tri-band 2G and dual-band 3G connectivity. Mobile data speeds go at 42.2 Mbps of HSDPA and 11.5 Mbps HSUPA. Only the primary SIM card can be connected to a 3G network and usually this is the SIM card you've chosen for mobile data (you can still make and receive calls on that SIM, don't worry). The other SIM will be connected only to a GSM network. You can opt to use data traffic from the second SIM, but you'll be limited to EDGE connectivity and speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use it through the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers). There is no NFC support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go support, so you can attach external flash drives to the smartphone as well. You can connect mice and keyboard, too, thanks to the USB Host support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, replacing the former LiveWare manager. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or at a preset time. It doesn't work with NFC though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Xperia Link, which shares the phone's Internet connection over Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi. All you have to do is use the camera to scan the QR code generated by the app on the tablet or computer. If you have the Xperia Tablet Z, the app will also display notifications for incoming calls and show full text messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is your default web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome runs on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brand new setting is called Reduce data usage and does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone. You can check the graph to see how much data you've saved. Unlike Opera Mini, this mode keeps the full functionality of web pages. Also, secure connections bypass the Google servers for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, keep in mind you can use the Small app browser, which lets you surf while doing other things on the large screen. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to switch from Chrome to the floating browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C comes with the OfficeSuite 7 viewer. OfficeSuite 7 lets you view Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF along with plain text files. Just view them though, as you'll have to buy the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app has made its way onto the Xperia C, except this time its drawing capabilities have been moved to a separate Sketch app. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note/sketch and just start typing or doodling. You can customize a wide variety of drawing modes, backgrounds, and stencils, and there's also Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are also available from within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another helpful tool is the Update center, which checks for updates for your phone and your apps. You can enable automatic download with the option to use Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C also comes with Google+ and Facebook apps out of the box. The Facebook app also has a nice widget that will show you updates on the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is full of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (many even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps gets you around the world<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, which managed to get a lock in about a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Originally planned for China and other Asian markets, the Sony Xperia C obviously did better than expected and quickly made it well beyond its intended destination. Or it could be that Sony had global availability in mind from the start - only not making too much noise after the official China debut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, the Xperia C may not be the kind of phone to brag about but has obviously done more than a few things right. The phone is designed to look like the Xperia flagships and is built to high standard. The Android experience is reasonably fluid, something Sony did well to build on with a good set of home-brewed apps and a properly spec'd camera complete with 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that the specs don't quite translate into stellar image quality but the Xperia C is obviously not going to compete with top-of-the-line cameraphones. The screen resolution is perhaps not enough for the size but, after all, cheap screen real estate involves compromise. In the Xperia C's case that's pixel density, Bravia engine and Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should not forget either that the right thing to do in this price bracket is match or outdo the competition without investing over the odds. With Asian markets flooded with affordable "high-end" phones, Sony went for the obvious choice of chipset, hardware and features hoping the quality Sony is known to deliver will tip the scales in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a different kind of competition to consider too - dual-SIM droids are thriving lately with most of the major manufacturers seriously involved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung may have closed a lap on the others with a second generation of their dual-SIM enabled Galaxy Grand. The original Galaxy Grand was released a year ago with a 5" WVGA display, an 8MP camera and a dual-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A9 processor. There's less raw performance compared to the Xperia C, and even fewer pixels on that massive screen. A successor has already been announced though to fix that. The Galaxy Grand 2 boasts a 5.25" 720p display and a quad-core processor, along with an 8MP camera with 1080p videos. It will hit the shelves any moment now, but it will likely costs more than the Xperia C.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Grand I9082 ? Samsung Galaxy Grand 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro Lite Dual is another dual-SIM option with a 5.5" IPS qHD display, dual-core Cortex-A9 processor and 8MP camera with 720p video recording. It has just been released, but unfortunately costs a good ?50 more than the Xperia C. You will be getting a bigger screen, but less processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G Pro Lite Dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has a few dual-SIM packages this year with classy designs taking after the flagship. The HTC Desire 601 is the closest thing to an Xperia C direct rival and it scores points for stereo Boom Sound front speakers, qHD display and quad-core chipset. It's notably pricier though and unless you are really into music we can hardly justify the premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire 601 dual sim</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo R819 is probably one of the Xperia C's biggest worry. Had it not lacked a microSD card slot the R819 would have been probably killed the Xperia C prospects altogether. Being a dual-SIM droid based on the same MT6589 quad-core chipset, but with a far superior 720p IPS display plus thinner and lighter body, the Oppo mid-ranger is a notable upgrade over its Sony rival. However 16GB of non-expandable storage will certainly make a lot of people cross the R819 off their lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo R819</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer and Gigabyte have some attractive dual-SIM phones as well - the Acer Liquid E2 and Gigabyte GSmart Maya M1 v2. The two devices share most of their specs - 4.5" IPS qHD displays, quad-core MediaTek chips (same as Xperia C), 8MP cams and Android 4.2 in charge of operations. Both the Liquid E2 and Maya M1 v2 cost the same as Xperia C and the only difference is in the custom launchers the manufactures are providing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Acer Liquid E2 ? Gigabyte GSmart Maya M1 v2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C can be summed up in a few words - it's the big screen and dual SIM support that define it, and the affordable price. This isn't the first attempt by Sony in the multiple SIM segment and big screens are a growing trend in the midrange. What Sony is doing right - and arguably better by the competition - is being able to both match the price of Chinese makers and the features of top-tier competitors. The Xeria C isn't a spectacular package, far from it, but one that focuses on the right things - and the right customers.</paragraph>
