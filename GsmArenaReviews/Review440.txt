			<paragraph>We have tested the stylish Nokia 6111 slider. It's delicate; it has megapixel camera, MP3 player and built-in radio. Why the memory card is missing though? Nokia says that it is a phone for the ladies. Can it turn men's heads, too?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Although we'll find a lot of phones with sliding construction in the Nokia proposals, Nokia 6111 model is the first stylish phone of this type. The brand itself presents it like a smart little phone, intended for the ladies' hands and handbags. Of course, it is not only a female thing, 6111 is very appealing for men as well; the equipment is solid, there is EDGE support, Bluetooth and active standby display, which is something rare in a classic phone so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other on-coming production, like Siemens CF110 or Siemens SL75 for example, immediately are coming into my mind when looking at Nokia 6111. The legend, named Samsung D500 and its successor Samsung D600 are inseparably passing trough the whole "pack of sliders", too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has slightly moved back from its daring creativity. The design maniacs could speak favorable for the Nokia experiments, but it would be pointless, having in mind the fact that the company doesn't manage to sell these models according to the plans. Nokia had put its fingers in the fire with its clamshells, that's why the "Asian" 6101 has appeared. Nothing however has to be left to the chance with the sliders; the right way is just the conservative way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two color variants<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6111 is ok in hands. You'll have to rummage in your briefcase for a while however, until you find this device with its proportions of 84 × 47 × 23 millimeters and a 92 grams weight. There are two color variants - the silver base remains the same, while the internal lining is black or white. This implementation anticipates the probable men's hesitations, such as "the functions of this phone answer my requirements, but this white color..."</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Live pictures of Nokia 6111</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I have in hand exactly the version for men. Right here I am complaining about the black plastic surfaces, which maybe looked good at the promotional photographs, but get on nerves in practice. A day usage is enough for the phone to get greasy. The hand leaves its marks on the 6111 cover more than it is acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The phone in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Comparing the size with a credit card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone size is almost like a credit card, that's why all operating elements are easily accessible. The main button switch is at the top; initially I thought it was a cover safety catch, Nokia 6111 doesn't have exchangeable covers, though. The button could have been less sunk; moreover its response is not clear, I have locked the phone three times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6111 from all sides</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compact plastic capping strip of the Pop-Port connector and the new narrower charger slot are mounted right above. I have found also here a red sliding plate; after pressing it the back cover loosens. After its removal you'll se a 700 mAh battery, promising 192 hours stand-by and more than 3 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; A battery appears after the removal of the cover </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SIM card on the backside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A place behind the display is prepared for the SIM card. On the back of the upper sliding part we'll find a wicket door, behind which is the slot for the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The small slot of the SIM card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Behind, right next to the shiny "Nokia Megapixel" sign, the border ornament of the camera lens protrudes outwards unpleasantly. It looks good, but you'll forgot about all its beauty when see your phone constantly shaking on the table, taking funny unstable poses. I would appreciate also a cover for the lens glass - when you hold Nokia 6111 with your left hand the forefinger tip reaches exactly the optics, the right hand contacts the glass, too. There is a tiny self-portrait mirror and a flash LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Camera lens ? self-portrait mirror ? flash ? the phone doesn't lie firmly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a thick cover for the infrared port and the loud speaker on the left side. On the right, there are two small, but convenient buttons for volume control and a very unsuccessful camera shutter, which I would criticize in the part, devoted to the megapixel pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrared port ? loud speaker grid ? volume control</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It takes some practice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sliding mechanism isn't by far as easy as it is in the top construction of Samsung D500/D600. The assistant strings react not before the half of the track and you have to spend grater energy on it. When we add to this the glossy casing, we can say that the drawing-out of the Nokia 6111 with one hand isn't easy at all and requires practice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The phone drawn out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower part hides the alphanumeric buttons of the keyboard. They are produced from the same material as the back cover and the panel of the display, so they have similar characteristics - they are fingertip magnets and are slithery. It is not positively a drawback, fingers don't hitch as in the rubber keys' case and the writing can be really fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;The keyboard is good, but easy gets stained </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed the phone is also well operated due to the context keys and call control buttons. These are available under the display. There is a four-way navi-key between them, which would satisfy the ladies, because it can be easily controlled with fingernails. My finger tip was too big for the thin edge of the four-way button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;The main operating buttons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loud clicking of the navigation button began to annoy me in the course of time, but my fears about the insufficient size of the confirming centre, provoked by the official photographs had disappeared. The illumination is enough and even, excellent on the upper sliding part. Only the lightening trough some gaps between the buttons or the clutches under the border ornament of the cover is not good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The lightening of the main operating components and the keyboard</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An average display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display looks small even on such a small phone. The reason for this are the cut corners of the upper sliding part, resp. the optical perception, which they provoke. No one would believe about the factual proportions of the display - 28 × 35 millimeters, the same counts also for the 256K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;The display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display has a resolution of 128 × 160 pixels. Such a resolution means just a medium quality nowadays; the screen raster is apparent; extra pixels would suit better to such an expensive phone. The contrast and the luminance are good enough; it is not problem to read text messages or insert events into the organizer even at direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is slightly upgraded, compared to the older Series 40 phones. That's why besides the wallpapers on the standby display you may be welcomed also by the so-called "active standby mode". It doesn't reach the functionality of the smartphones, but is very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Display in standby mode ? the main menu ? sub-menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to it you don't have to look in the calendar every day, all current events are shown directly on the main display. You may scroll through the days directly from stand-by mode. The shortcut icons are on the top, the two middle fields are for the music player and the built-in FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Example of the active standby display </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left context key serve for the "Go to" function; you may set the function of the right key. To activate the navigation of the lists in the standby mode you just have to use the up or down directions of the navigation key. Then you can use the left and right directions to work with the selected list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> "Go to" folder and its organization</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pleasant is the fact that there is a variety of colors in phone standby mode - the white characters don't fade away in the dark wallpapers. Just pity that this change is not available in the whole menu, most of the dark wallpapers of the color themes are accompanied by the dark background of the rest of the menu. All items in the menu and "Go to" folder may be easily moved elsewhere. The selected icon or title is highlighted in green; then you may move it around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Font color selection for the stand-by mode ? moving menu items</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Clear sound, but not loud enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The speaker is taken out only to the left opening of the shiny phone frame. Its sound is clear enough; the volume however could be higher; I have experienced problems on a noisy street and had to draw the phone close to the ear. The microphone is mounted on the upper sliding part, so it doesn't matter whether Nokia 6111 is closed or not. There are loud handsfree available during the call, to which I have the same criticism like towards the speaker - they could be louder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker outlet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speakerphone, mounted under the grid on the left side takes care of the ringing. The bass element is missing and is even flatter than we have usually used to in mobile phones. In addition, the speaker is more than ever prone to muffling in the pocket or in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ringing may be quickly set with the help of the profiles. They are five in the phone; you may change the ringing melody and the sound alert, it doesn't affect the time expiration of the profile. Besides the polyphonic ringtones you may play also your favorite MP3 track as a ringing melody.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Imposing contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has several view options. There are regular and huge font sizes. The contacts from the SIM card or from the internal phone memory can be shown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;The phonebook in classic type ? with the biggest font ? contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the advanced settings you may choose whether to store a contact by the name or surname. Further the phonebook view can be set according to the selection "name list", "name and number" or "name and picture". You may set shortcuts to eight numeric keys and may dial up to 25 names by voice (the voice dialing is not speaker independent like in some other models). The search in the phonebook is by gradual writing of the names. You may arrange the contacts in groups and set pictures and ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Displaying options ? contacts search</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may fill up to 12 fields for each contact: five type of numbers, address and web address, email, note and others. I missed the option for birthdays entering, which than could be put on directly in the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering a new contact ? adding a detail to the contact ? possible type numbers</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich messaging functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6111 works with classic text messages, multimedia messages, instant messages and email; it can also send sound record with length of maximum three minutes. The message editor is quite well-arranged and graphically nice worked out. A bigger display would suit better - the name or the recipient number and the body of the message are somewhere "in the clouds", which on such a small area sometimes looks overburden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huge, normal and very small letter type setting options are proposed for writing and reading. When using the last designated (small) the display may get up to eight rows while writing and one more while reading messages. The countdown begins from the first character (913 totally), you may write a message up to six parts. The editor speed doesn't decrease while creating the text, the sound of the keys obtrude however (in case you have it switched on); it can't respond in time to button presses and confuse the users' feedback in such way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Message editor with different letter type sizes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a T9 dictionary with an option to select from classic writing or automatic word completion. Writing with it is ok, the prediction doesn't bother unnecessarily. In case you don't want to use T9, you may turn it off, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New multimedia messages</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All thinkable stuff may be inserted in the multimedia messages: text, picture, sound or video clip. In addition - a calendar note or a call card. The maximum size of the composed messages is 300 KB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Day by day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar is comprehensive and virtually complete. There is a weekly and a monthly view; a daily view and details about separate events are also available. The memory for records is shared; there are five types of events: meeting, call, birthday, memo and reminder. The week begins according to the wish of the user - in Saturday, Sunday or Monday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Monthly and daily view of the calendar ? selecting the first day of the week</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you need more than 160 characters for a note there is an option to use more extensive independent notepad, which proposes up to 3000 chars. To every event you may set reminding and repeating options for day, week, two weeks or year. The repeating option is automatically set to birthdays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; New event ? setting repeating ? daily view ? event details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-do list is sophisticated. Besides the classic setting of three levels of importance and accomplishment denotation, there is an option to mark the tasks as not fulfilled; you may order the records according to the time of entering or the deadline. Storing in the calendar is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  A note ? a new task ? setting details ? tasks list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6111 has a simple calculator with adjustable currency exchange rate. You can sweeten your early get up by setting MP3 track or radio in the alarm clock. You can adjust the snooze time-out for the alarm. The proposal of organizer functions ends with the stopwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Alarm ? stopwatch</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless the music player is simple it serves its purpose completely - we must have in mind the fact that the internal memory reaches the size of 23 MB. It is a good valuation for the phone itself, but is unbelievable insufficient for the full-value MP3 player, moreover - we cannot insert a memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; MP3 player ? playing options ? the equalizer has manual control</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tracks can be played repeatedly or at random, you may create simple list with the songs you want to listen. You can always select only from one place, the Gallery, for example. The sound reaches the ears trough the added HS-23 headphones, because the output is coming trough the Pop-Port. You have to use an adapter for 3.5mm jack in order to connect your favorite headphones. The HS-23 headphones are playing quite middling in the medium and high tones. I must commend however their surround effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The enclosed HS-23 headphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in radio has mono and stereo sound mode, it has automated station search and is doing it very well. There is a place for storing up to 23 stations. Of course, you can't use the radio without the added headphones - the cable serves as an antenna. You may see its functioning on the active standby display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Radio ? functioning of the player on the active standby display</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Preprocessed images?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The built-in camera is a full megapixel. Just at the beginning of the test I thought that I would miss very much the memory card slot. But first things first... the maximum resolution is 1152 × 864; there are three lower resolutions - VGA, QVGA and 160 × 120 pixels. There are three options for quality setting of the JPEG files and just one possible resolution of 176 × 144 for 3GP video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The display as a viewfinder ? setting options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is taking photos horizontally; the display switches to landscape mode. The volume control operates the six fold digital zoom, which is working however only with crops. The built-in flash is strong enough despite its small size. There is too much noise when the night mode is activated; the image on the display lags. Sorry, no superlatives about the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   An object in the dark ? with the flash at close range ? at a bigger distance ? night mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;The digital zoom creates crops </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera shutter is just inconvenient; the fact that it is too sunk intrudes its comfortable usage. So, I have used the confirming centre of the navigation key instead during all of the time of the testing. Moreover, the scene captured on the display does not show exactly what is taken by the optics. It is slightly deflected rightwards and is cut. This aggravates the composition in shots taken at close distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera shutter is too much sunk </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures quality is nothing special; Nokia 6111 is susceptible to overexposure, there is not exposure compensation; there is no color balance correction option. Areas with similar colors are melting into the background as after an effect in Photoshop, the pictures look preprocessed. It seems that the internal noise reduction causes this watercolor effect. That's why I suddenly stopped missing the memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; More sample pictures in full resolution </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Some more details<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The WAP content can be browsed quite supple due to the supported EDGE Class 10. You may even use some regular web sites in case you know the addresses of their text versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Entering addresses </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may download a game for Java 2.0 version from WAP or PC via Bluetooth or you may entertain yourself with the four built-in games. Besides them, there are also other useful applications like comprehensive currency converter or world time. The purpose of the phone's graphic presentation left a mystery to me. Maybe it is intended for use in the mobile phone stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Backgammon II ? Golf Tour ? Rally 3D ? Solitaire</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Currency converter ? Nokia 6111 presentation ? world time</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6111 will meet difficulties on the market. I have already mentioned the competitors in the beginning while describing the design. At about the same price you can get the Samsung D500 with better construction and considerably higher quality display. When released the Siemens SL75 can be considered as a competitor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest flaw on the beauty of the stylish Nokia 6111 slider is the lack of memory card slot and the lower quality of the camera. What about the conception that is intended only for ladies? May be yes, according to the advertisement spot of the manufacturer, but it may turn men's heads, especially the black version.</paragraph>
