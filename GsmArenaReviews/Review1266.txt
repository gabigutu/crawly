			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tablets are cool. But they have a purpose too. Larger screens, higher resolution and more mileage out of the battery make them better suited for certain tasks. That?s why people are not only fascinated by them but do end up actually needing one. What?s not so cool is the need to carry two devices all the time, especially when one of them won?t fit into any reasonable pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's where the Samsung Galaxy Note comes in. It aims to squeeze the high-res screen and battery longevity of a tablet into a package that is still pocketable. And it does - but success is by no means guaranteed. There's nothing between the Galaxy Note and 7" tablets. And while it sounds good to have all that room to themselves, Samsung need to fill it with meaning. The right kind of users will be easily convinced of the advantages of an enlarged Galaxy S II. Not so sure about a compressed tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's no reason to go into this with a skeptical attitude. Just look at that specs sheet!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren?t many smartphones around that can instill an inferiority complex in the Galaxy S II, but the Galaxy Note does a pretty good job of it. The Exynost chipset's got a faster CPU, the AMOLED screen has a million pixels and, most importantly, there?s more of it. And even the notoriously power-hungry Android will have a hard time pushing through the 2500 mAh battery in a day, which is what many modern-day smartphones will do more often than not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there?s the S Pen, which promises to add a whole new dimension to the smartphone experience. Good old-fashioned notepads haven't been having a blast lately, but the Note threatens to put another nail in their coffin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a beast we have on our hands here and it won?t be easy taming it. We'd better get to it then and keep the Galaxy Note busy. The hardware inspection starts right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Taking a peek inside the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has managed to fit the Galaxy Note in a surprisingly compact box - just a few millimeters larger than the device itself. The bundle includes a charger, a one-piece headset, a microUSB cable and a quick start guide. That?s all the basics covered, considering that the device offers ample storage out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news is that the MHL adapter required for HD TV-out and the USB adapter enabling the USB host functionality aren?t included. It?s a real pity ? both work pretty well but many users will probably not bother purchasing them and won?t get a chance to try them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 146.9 x 83 x 9.7 mm the Samsung Galaxy Note is not your ordinary smartphone. Samsung have done well to keep the waistline so slim. Big devices are extremely sensitive to that kind of thing. The Galaxy Note is huge but not the solid muscular type. The slim body and massive screen have a sense of fragility about them, lacking physical strength. At 178 g it?s lighter than you?d expect - the Note is just 10 grams heavier than an Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung went for simplicity with the Galaxy Note's design and that seems like a pretty good idea. There's nothing even remotely subtle about a 5.3? device and going all fancy on the finishing would have probably pushed things a bit too far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the patterned back that we?ve come to know and like from the Galaxy S II only this time it?s in dark blue (so dark, it?s as good as black). It has little to do with providing extra grip. A device this size is much harder than usual to handle and the texture of the battery cover can do little to fix that. And knowing how much it costs, you really wouldn?t want to drop it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note has a metal frame running all around the sides and a front panel with a single control ? the hardware home key. Of course, that?s the only thing to notice with the screen turned off. Once you power it on, it will easily get all the attention.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5.3? HD Super AMOLED<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 features a 5.3? Super AMOLED screen of WXGA resolution. That?s right ? we are talking 1280 x 800 pixels of unmatched contrast on the largest AMOLED screen on the market (a title the Galaxy Tab 7.7 is soon to claim for itself). Super AMOLEDs were impressive enough on a smaller scale, but this one is spectacular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having mentioned the specs, we hardly need to go on and on about the image quality. With a pixel density of about 285ppi and infinite contrast, the huge AMOLED is a joy to behold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness levels are adequate (though they aren?t a Super AMOLED forte to begin with) and we have the typically flawless outdoor performance. Everything remains perfectly legible on the Note's display, no matter how bright the sun is. Viewing angles are also top notch - it almost feels the icons are painted on the top of the glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the other recent AMOLEDs by Samsung, the Note display has a setting for the color saturation. You can choose between the super punchy but not quite real colors and a more natural look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside of the 5.3? screen is that, unlike its Super AMOLED Plus siblings, it uses a PenTile matrix, instead of a conventional RGB one. It means that each pixel is composed of two, rather than three subpixels, which lowers the effective resolution whenever subpixel rendering is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, with the Galaxy Note having so many pixels the infamous dotiness is much harder to spot. Basically, you'll need to look from a much shorter distance than what feels comfortable for working with the smartphone. Bottom line is that with that kind of pixel density, PenTile makes much less difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here comes our traditional display brightness test, which confirms that the Galaxy Note Super AMOLED is only slightly brighter than the Samsung Galaxy S II. It?s the infinity scores in the third and sixth columns that matter the most, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you manage to take your eyes away from the magnificent display, you'll find that the tour around the rest of the Galaxy Note hardware is a pretty short one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen you find a couple of capacitive keys (Menu and Back) and a hardware Home button. A long press on the Menu key lets you quickly initiate a search, while a press-and-hold of the home button opens up the task manager. A quick double tap on the hardware Home key on the front brings up the Galaxy Note voice commands menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vlingo-powered voice assistant will get some more attention in the user interface chapter of the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you get the usual set of hardware components ? an earpiece, a proximity sensor and a front-facing camera that can be used for video-chatting or 3G video-calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the Samsung Galaxy Note features the volume rocker and that's not the most convenient place to have it obviously. There's almost no way to reach and comfortably press it in single-handed use. It makes sense though when holding the phone landscape: it's right under your left thumb when you're watching a video for example, or using the camera (the volume rocker doubles as a zoom lever).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more important reason for having the volume keys on the left is that the right side of the smartphone is reserved for the power/lock key. It would've made little sense on the top in a device this size. On the side, it's fairly easy to reach when you're holding the phone with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on top of the Galaxy Note. The Note's secondary microphone (enabling stereo sound recording in videos and noise-suppression in calls ) is also located here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other microphone is at the bottom, next to the microUSB port. The connectivity port is used for both charging and data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens has the LED flash by its side on the back of the Samsung Galaxy Note. The loudspeaker is here too, near the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen compartment is in the bottom right corner. The stylus comes with a key that allowed Samsung to implement some clever gestures, but those will get their deserved attention in the next part of the review. What we?d like to mention here is that the S Pen itself is rather hard to pull out. Maybe it's better that way than being too loose and likely to fall off and get lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 2500 mAh battery, which is powerful enough to get the Galaxy Note through several days of moderate use on a single charge. However, a screen that big certainly takes its toll, so don?t expect miracles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note got a battery rating of 39 in our recently introduced battery test. You can expect 39 hours between charges with an hour of 3G calls, and hour of video playback and an hour of web browsing each day. That?s better than what we are used to seeing from modern-day smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the battery are the non-hot-swappable microSD card slot and SIM card compartment. It?s a pity that you aren?t able to change microSD cards with the Galaxy Note still running and with so much available space, we feel Samsung could have done better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall ergonomics of the Samsung Galaxy Note are a story of two parts. If you look at it and see a compact tablet, you'll love the big and super crisp screen. One-handed operation is awkward - at least at first - but certainly not impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware keys are often out of reach but in return, you get plenty of HD screen estate to enjoy your pictures, videos and favorite websites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The simple styling and all-plastic build are the right thing for this phone. We have no qualms with the build quality. The massive screen and slim profile make it look delicate but there's nothing to worry in terms of daily wear and tear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing we're not sure about is actually using the thing as a phone. It could look a bit weird and embarrassing. But hey, what are headphones for?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note comes with the phone version of Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread and the home-baked TouchWiz 4.0 launcher out of the box. The changed look is down to the fact that the WXGA resolution can accommodate more stuff on some screens but, for the most part, it's identical to what you get on the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note comes with a somewhat different design for the lockscreen, but it works in just the same way - you can go past it by placing your finger anywhere and swiping in any direction. The lock symbol appears under your finger, placed within two circles. Your swipe has to get out of the outer circle for the screen to unlock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events get their own notifications on the lockscreen with dedicated icons. If you start your unlocking gesture there you are taken straight to the respective app (call log, messaging center, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is pretty much unchanged. The process of adding widgets to the homescreen has some pretty nice transition effects too, so there's nothing missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some Galaxy Note exclusive widgets, which let you launch the S Pen applications. We'll be looking at them in a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Galaxy S II, the Galaxy Note comes with two cool live wallpapers, developed in cooperation with Accuweather, which display the current weather conditions on the whole screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Think Sense UI weather widget, but on a larger scale. The two different wallpapers in fact only differ by the background ? one has a few wind-power propellers, while the other uses a beach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual ? you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregate view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panes serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was some work done on the app toolbar at the bottom. For one, you can now create folders inside it (though given you can have folders on the homescreen, we don?t see much use for that here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, creating folders on the shortcut toolbar is pretty easy stuff ? in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create new menu pages in much the same way ? browsing your existing ones and picking the icons that you want to have placed on the new page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Needless to say, the app launcher panes can be rearranged exactly like you would the homescreen ? pinch zoom and some swiping around does the trick quickly and intuitively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The added bonus here is that each app drawer pane holds five rows of five icons each instead of the 4x4 grid of the Galaxy S II. The docked icons at the bottom are also five now ? both possible thanks to the larger higher-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, but there aren?t any major changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the task manager, which Samsung has preinstalled, has seen some functional updates. The RAM screen has been modified and there is only one clear memory button now, instead of the two in the previous version. Now, with 1GB or RAM and with the new Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn?t hurt having it on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like its smaller Galaxy S II sibling, the Galaxy Note supports gesture controls across the interface. Those include the usual stuff like turn-to-mute or snoozing the alarm, as well as tilting your phone to zoom in and out in the gallery or the web browser. You can also turn it sideways to move widgets around the homescreen or icons around the app drawer. To be fair though, we only found the turn to mute really helpful and rarely used any of the others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is probably the most dramatic change to the user interface that the Galaxy Note brings. We know many of you are skeptical about using styli on a capacitive screen, but there?s a reason why this one deserved a name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is a passive device (as in, it has no battery), but it still offers some extra functionality thanks to the button that?s built into the little stick. You can simply use it to replace your finger of course, but that?s hardly the point here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real fun starts when the S Pen button comes into play. For starters, if you hold the key and hold the S Pen over any screen of the Note UI, it will make a screenshot and go straight to edit mode, so you can put down notes over that same screenshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can hold the key and double tap on the screen (again it works in any part of the interface) to launch the S Memo Lite pad. That?s merely a blank page for you to take notes, draw and whatnot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press of the S Pen key and swipe to the left means back, so you can also navigate the interface with it. If you do the same thing but swipe upwards instead, the context menu will appear, as if you have pressed the left capacitive key. That means that the S Pen allows you to operate your phoneblet without pressing any hardware keys, making Gingerbread an all-touch platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we prepared a video to give you an idea of the responsiveness and precision of the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen isn?t exactly instant - in fact it's slightly on the slow side, but with the kind of precision it offers does its job quite well. There is room for improvement, of course, but even as it is the fancy stylus opens quite a lot of doors to the Galaxy Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And things might get even better if developers take the challenge when Samsung release the S Pen SDK in December. The potential is there, but the Samsung-developed apps only use some of it. It?s up to the devs to take care of the rest. The necessary pre-requirement is for Samsung to sell enough Note units to make it easy for developers to monetize their efforts or the whole thing will be in vain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll now take a look at the performance of the Exynos chipset. The Galaxy S II is currently top of our benchmarks table, but the Note with its overclocked dual-core Cortex A9 CPU might have a few things to say about that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance benchmarks are promising<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with a couple of ARM Cortex-A9 CPU cores, clocked at the respectable 1.4GHz, and the Mali-400MP GPU, we wouldn?t expect the Samsung Galaxy Note to be anything short of a benchmark buster. As we'll see in a moment it didn?t disappoint - always placing at the top or right below it. And that is despite the HD resolution, which means that the Note needs to refresh 167% more pixels than its WVGA competitors, and 98% more than the qHD smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put the Note Exynos chipset performance into context, we chose to compare it to some of the most powerful competitors. Recently updated to Gingerbread, the LG Optimus 2X will be defending the Tegra 2 cause, the HTC Sensation XE will be fighting under the Qualcomm Snapdragon flag, while the Galaxy S II, will try and answer if the increase in clock speed is enough to compensate for the higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We started with BenchmarkPi, which is set to test the pure calculating power of each CPU. Unsurprisingly, the Note took the crown here as it has the highest clock speed of the Cortex-A9 gang. The Sensation XE offers the CPU with the highest clock of the bunch, but it uses the older Scorpion architecture, so it?s unable to pose a real challenge here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other CPU-only benchmark we did was Linpack and we saw a similar picture. With all competitors employing dual-core architectures, we went for the multi-threaded version of the benchmark. The Note beat its competitors quite comfortably, achieving more than twice the score of the Sensation XE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We then moved on to the GPUs and ran NenaMark 2 on the four smartphones. The Note ended up only second best here, which is still quite an achievement. The Galaxy S II had it easy as it has the same GPU as its bigger brother and took advantage of its lower resolution to beat it. The Note still managed to score better than the Optimus 2X and the Sensation XE though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two benchmarks were browser-related and were set to test the JavaScript performance, as well as the CPUs of the contenders. The Samsung Galaxy Note was already seeing itself as the winner here, after beating the previous leader ? Galaxy S II, but the Optimus 2X put in a fresh challenge after its Gingerbread update and ended up on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark came in next and saw the Samsung Galaxy Note concede its first defeat. The Note did about as good as the Galaxy S II, but that was some way off the pace set by the Optimus 2X and the Sensation XE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, by the time we run the last benchmark on the Galaxy Note, the Sensation XE was no longer around so it won?t be represented. Still, even if it was it wouldn?t be able to come anywhere near the Galaxy Note score of 4349. Some way to dethrone the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, the Samsung Galaxy Note is one hell of a powerhouse and there?s little to worry about in terms of future proofing. It can easily beat or at least match every single one of the current crop of droid flagships in terms of processing power, so you can rest assured that it will be offering you all the performance you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let?s see if the user interface is as feature-rich as it is fast.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook does it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have moved a few things around on the Note but the phonebook is pretty much the same as it was in the Galaxy S II. It has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note can display your Google, phone, and SIM contacts simultaneously or any subset of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you?ve created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook keeps the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too ? swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the talent of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard ? one displays the person?s contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff ? status updates and the contact?s online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony perfectly covered, voice commands add extra value<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note had great in-call quality and the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn?t suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query). We also notice the familiar quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also available ? a double tap on the Home key activates voice commands. All you need to do is press the large virtual button at the bottom of the screen or say ?Hi Galaxy? and speak your command (e.g. ?text Dexter?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the Vlingo-powered service applications stretch well beyond voice calling and texting. You can use it to start your applications, dictate notes, set up appointments, update your social status, start navigation and whatnot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy family voice commands are more of a direct competitor of the Siri service that Apple promoted so heavily on the iPhone 4S. The customized Vlingo services carries the benefits of further-fetching functionality and better work with accents, plus the fact that it doesn?t carry the US-only restrictions found on the iPhone. However, it lacks the natural language commands support ? you need to keep to a strict syntax here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, Jan 27, 2012:We re-tested the loudspeaker performance of the Galaxy Note, this time of a retail unit straight from the store. The good news is that there's improvement. The phoneblet scored an Average mark this time around instead of the previous Below average score. Average is decent enough though you might still want to keep a close eye on it in noisier environments. You can find more about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping over a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger ? as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically transformed into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between accounts is pretty easy. The top row holds two labels ? the first is the name of the inbox you?re currently viewing (tap to change the inbox) and the one next to it is the name of the current folder (again, tap to change it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note sports a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone landscape activates the split view ? the left side of the screen shows the list of emails, while the right side shows a message. This feature is present on the Galaxy S II as well, but it makes much more sense here as only a screen as large as this allows you to read comfortably by only using two thirds of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text entry is handled by the standard Samsung QWERTY keyboard, which offers very big and comfortable keys. In landscape mode, the keyboard takes up most of the display and the even bigger keys make it one of the most comfortable virtual mobile keyboards around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can use the S Pen for your text input. The Galaxy Note did decently with recognizing our handwritten symbols, but we still found this to be the much slower option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing your images over just about anything is a couple of clicks away. If you have setup social network accounts you can also post your images straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note uses the standard TouchWiz music player, which is pretty good news as we cannot think of a feature that it lacks. But for the automatically generated album art that we saw on the N9, it does everything you?d expect of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nice music-based visualization with the bars moving on the screen and you can easily share any track you are listening to over mail, Wi-Fi, or any of the social networks you have set up on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (move them back or forward a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it ? starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn?t a problem either ? the Samsung Galaxy Note played FullHD files with ease. Large files of over 2GB worked as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Needless to say, with a screen that big and resolution this high the Galaxy Note makes a great portable video player. You just transfer the videos to it (which is quite easy too) and enjoy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The even better news is that the battery support won?t let you down either. We found the Galaxy Note capable of 8:25 hours of continuous video playback on a single charge, which should suffice for just about every scenario.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save 6 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed to serve as an antenna.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the Samsung Galaxy Note passed our audio quality test with flying colors. It couldn't beat the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, but it did better than every other Samsung device we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see there's nothing to frown at when the Galaxy Note is connected to an active external amplifier. We were somewhat surprised by the low volume levels, but the output couldn't be any cleaner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were also pleased to find out that there is only slight deterioration when headphones are attached. The stereo crosstalk reading took the biggest hit, but the intermodulation distortion and frequency response stayed very good earing an excellent mark overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera offers good image quality and nice UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash and 28mm wide-angle lens but, unfortunately, no shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s the same module that you get on the Galaxy S II and as you know that one is still among the best 8 megapixel cameraphones out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is identical, too, with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get five controls by default but the good news is that you can pick any shortcuts to put there ? commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Samsung Galaxy Note offers quite a lot ? touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, digital image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. The list goes on, but those are the ones that really count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images captured with the 8MP camera of the Galaxy Note are very good. In fact we couldn?t tell them apart from those produced by the Galaxy S II. Low noise, plenty of fine detail and good contrast make up for a pretty cool combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white balance is a bit too cool for our liking, but we guess that has something to do with the Super AMOLED screen that?s supposed to be the primary way of viewing those. We guess Samsung tuned the photos so they look better on the screen, sacrificing some image quality in the process.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note enters the skirmish over in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In short, the camera produced a very detailed image with very little in terms of processing artifacts (traces of sharpening), no moiré patterns, but it has a noticeable pink spot.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video is great too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The front mounted camera can record video too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peculiar thing to note is that when shooting FullHD videos you have a narrower field of view than that of the still camera. The explanation is that the camcorder uses only the center of the 8MP sensor instead of shooting with the whole surface and then scale it down to 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In 720p video capture mode however they use the whole sensor and as a result you have almost the same wide field of view as the still camera (about 30mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means for the occasional videographer is 720p videos might turn out the better option in low light as the process of pixel binning used for downsizing the information captured from the 8 megapixel sensor down to 720p actually helps suppress digital noise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The longer focal range in 1080p mode also makes for a shakier video so you might want to look for a hand-rest while recording to get the best out of the Samsung Galaxy S FullHD camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder features continuous autofocus, which is pretty smooth though a bit slow at times. Stereo recording will also be appreciated by many - in fact that's the main difference between the Note and the Galaxy S II in the imaging department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than those peculiarities, the video quality is very good at 1080p ? the .MP4 files come with high bitrate (usually about 15-17 Mbps) and have a lot of detail. The framerate is quite consistent ? there are no dropped or duplicated frames, but you should keep in mind that the framerate drops to 24 when lighting isn't enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are nice and smooth too, but obviously short of the extra resolution offered by FullHD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video captured with the Samsung Galaxy Note for you to enjoy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity chock-full of new technologies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note starts off with the basics ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G (AWS is missing though). There?s HSPA+ with 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which some carriers brand as ?4G? even though it?s not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there?s Bluetooth 3.0 with High Speed, which promises transfer speeds of up to 21Mbps. Wi-Fi Direct is a similar technology, which offers simple pairing of two devices but blazing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There isn't one included in the retail box and those are quite hard to get by, which is pretty disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy Note screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL port has yet another feature ? it enables USB On-The-Go. You?ll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straight forward ? you plug it into the Galaxy Note and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A great web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Galaxy Note propel it to great heights of user experience. The large, sharp display with great colors makes surfing a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, Find On Page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum ? that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful dual-core CPU (and the GPU acceleration) enables the Galaxy Note browser to play 1080p Flash video. That was truly impressive stuff ? a lot of netbooks would still choke on something like that. You can play touch-optimized Flash games without a hitch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news is that all this performance comes at the price of rather mediocre battery life when browsing the web. The Galaxy Note only managed 3:35 hours of browsing before it depleted its fully charged battery, which is not that impressive. Hardly surprising though, considering how taxing white screens are on the AMOLED screens and knowing that most websites predominantly serve their text content on white backgrounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best parts of the Android ecosystem is that even if you don?t like the default browser there?s nothing to worry about. The Android market offers more alternatives than any of its competitors ? there?s Opera Mobile and Mini, Dolphin HD, SkyFire and many more. Those are slightly more battery-efficient, improving the Note browsing time to about 4 hours, but that?s merely because they lack GPU acceleration and that means worse performance than the default browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Note likes to edit Office files<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note comes with the Polaris Office preinstalled, which seems to be getting rather popular with hardware manufacturers lately. And for good reason, we guess ? it?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing covers an almost full set of options ? text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables (that?s a first). If you?re editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even full-featured PowerPoint presentations are doable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do practically anything with the app ? it?s better than the other mobile editors we?ve tested. Plus it doubles as a file manager and also integrates with Google Docs and Box.net.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer embraces the S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note organizer has been redesigned, to make maximum use of the S Pen. The calendar has been renamed to S Planner and offers seven different types of view, instead of the usual four. There is now a three-day view agenda and tasks right in the calendar app, instead of needing separate apps for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. We found the agenda view, which shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future, particularly useful for organizing your time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. You can adjust text size and use cut, copy and paste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note features a great alarm clock application as well, which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. You can also activate a Smart alarm for each of them, which will activate a pre-set amount of minutes (between 3 and 30) before the main alarm and wake you up gently by starting off quiet and gradually increasing the volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual Memo app has been replaced by S Memo, which lets you use the S Pen for taking notes, as if you have an actual notepad on your hands. The S Pen has plenty of useful tools for that and works quite smoothly, so you will hardly ever end up making memos on the Note the old-fashioned way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also the Mini Diary, which lets you also attach pictures and locations to your notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS with Google Maps Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn?t experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (and even larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, your money be better spent on a good app rather than a dedicated SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course ? Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it?s available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you are into testing some new features, you can try the Labs screen. The extras there are still in beta, but they can add quite a lot of new functionality ? like caching the map data for offline access or enlarging the font size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn?t do it for you, you can grab an alternative app off the Android Market ? there are both free and paid ones and some certainly offer a more comfortable interface, but few can match the map accuracy of the Google service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market is the Galaxy Note playground<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.4GHz dual-core CPU and powerful new graphics chip, the Samsung Galaxy Note can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.5 and there will be an ICS update before a huge number of apps for that one accumulates, so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android market is the fastest growing app repository around (also the one with the most free apps and number of downloads), so you can be sure that you won?t be having a shortage of software to install on your Galaxy Note. True, some apps aren?t designed to work on a WXGA screen, but most scale well, so the only thing you have to worry about is finding enough time to enjoy all those apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recently, Google also redesigned the Android Market interface to make it easier for you to find the quality apps. There are now featured apps, editors? picks and staff-recommended apps in addition to the usual top free and top paid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top new paid and top new free lists are worth checking out too and you shouldn?t forget the trending apps. Naturally, there is a built-in search and categories for the different types of apps so you don?t get lost. Recommendations are also based on your location to make it even easier to spot a quality app in the new Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if by some reason, the soon-to-become number 1 app repository on the market isn?t enough for you, you might want to check out some of the alternatives. Amazon has set up its own appstore and so has Opera, plus a few more minor app stores here and there. Choice is one of the best parts of the open platform.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This may be out of many people's comfort zone. Way out. The Samsung Galaxy Note believes in bigger is better. In many ways it is. The WXGA Super AMOLED is more than any smartphone can offer and the powerful Exynos adds brains to beauty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Far from perfect at this point, the S Pen certainly adds value to the package. So does the extended battery life (for an Android smartphone, at least) and the latest version of the TouchWiz UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, many of you are probably asking yourselves if the Galaxy Note could fully replace a tablet. The Note is a full-time smartphone that wants you to leave your tablet at home. The 5.3" display makes a big difference, compared to handsets, but it's not nearly as comfortable for watching video as a 10" tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the Note comes close to its tablet rivals is web browsing on the go. The resolution is there. It's easier to get from A to B. To us that's enough. You can have the best tablet money can buy on your coffee table or office desk. The Galaxy Note is a device you can actually carry around hassle-free. One that fits in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tablets are a hybrid. Supposed to fit between your smartphone and your laptop, a tablet is not able to perfectly replace either. We guess the Samsung Galaxy Note has a better shot against a smartphone and a tablet. Not necessarily the perfect choice for any situation, the Note will have you covered for most of the applications of modern day smart devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, we'd usually give you an overview of the potential competitors, but it's rather more complicated with the Galaxy Note. Save for the original Dell Streak there's no other device that fits in the same niche and it was seemingly ahead of its time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the Streak came out last summer, it wasn't the most powerful of phones available, it didn't have a higher-res screen or a larger battery and it was pretty heavy. Back then, the technology simply hadn't reached the level to allow the creation of a proper phoneblet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dell Streak</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the present, we probably see the biggest threat to the Samsung Galaxy Note in the face of the Galaxy Nexus. The Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich flagship comes with a 4.65" HD Super AMOLED, and plenty of oomph under the hood. There's no S Pen there, and roughly 30% less screen estate. The Galaxy Nexus is much easier to slip in a pocket though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Nexus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note is unchallenged in its own niche, but it's up to the market to determine the size of that niche. There's plenty of headroom to 7" tablets but supersized phones are pushing up and getting dangerously close. It's the likes of the Dell Streak, HTC Sensation XL and Galaxy Nexus that do the Galaxy Note a favor. Without them, it would've been a one-hit wonder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation XL</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, we don't think all phones will look like the Galaxy Note any time soon. Samsung are just pushing a little bit further than the rest. Stretching the comfort zone. The Galaxy Note is not what you're used to. You can take it as a warning. Or an invitation.</paragraph>
