			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may have a hard time finding this one in the deluge of entry-level smartphones, for which Samsung is in no small part responsible. Don't worry, it will find you. The Samsung Galaxy Fit will be ready and set well before the thought of upgrading ever crosses your mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The times are long gone when smartphones were scary and complicated. Little green men were a hoax, the little green robots are the real deal. And Samsung are busy carrying out their plan. Match every touchscreen feature phone - every Corby and every Star - with a droid smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit is the next in line of mass-market smartphones as Samsung look to simply outnumber the competition where they cannot outplay or outsmart it. The Fit might seem like a minor update of the Galaxy Mini: a tad bigger screen and a 5 MP autofocus camera, but in that price range those are still significant arguments to have on your side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The styling is a little bit subtler, but not in a way to expect it to appeal to business users or an older audience. That said, dropping the original working title of Galaxy Suit makes sense. It just sent the wrong message about the dress code.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit doesn't have the features to be considered as a business tool. It's a bottom-of-the-food-chain kind of smartphone and it knows it. The friendly little gadget is on the cheap side of smartphones, but keen to deliver complete connectivity and above average imaging. The low-res screen is the flip side of the coin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box enough to get you started<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit is shipped in a small box featuring a MicroUSB cable for computer connections and charging, a charger head, and a 2GB complimentary MicroSD card with an adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit S5670 is compact and welcoming ? a smartphone that will put novice users at ease. At 110.2 x 61.2 x 12.6 mm, the handset weighs 108 grams: easy to handle and with a reasonably solid feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Galaxy Mini, they squeezed a bigger screen in what's basically the same package. That's exactly what we meant when we said the Mini's screen could?ve been bigger.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit is a simple all-plastic phone that will not stun onlookers but won't give the wrong impression either. The design is clean, uncluttered, the most prominent accents being the chrome color bezel and the grooved pattern of the rear. The phones looks well built and is nice to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the device features the 3.3? TFT touchscreen of QVGA resolution. The poor resolution is something users need to accept in a low-end smartphone. The capacitive unit is very responsive and supports multi-touch but the graphics look bad: grainy and with poor contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, there?s a proximity sensor. An ambient light sensor is missing so you?ll have to manually set the brightness to match changing lighting conditions. Fair is fair though: using the Galaxy Fit S5670 out on a sunny day won?t be a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display, there is a single hardware button: the central Home key with two capacitive controls either side: Menu and Back. It's the same layout as in the Galaxy Mini, only the latter has all hardware buttons. The capacitive keys on the Fit don't have haptic feedback - there isn't a setting for that in the menu. Touchscreen haptics are disabled throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home button is set within its own frame and in no way interfering with the other two keys. It has a nice feel to it thanks to the brushed-texture finish. It tends to wobble a bit when you place a thumb on, which does feel cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone features the connectivity ports: a 3.5mm audio jack and the MicroUSB port, hidden under a sliding plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side holds only the power/lock button. It?s thin but sufficiently raised with good press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the volume rocker and MicroSD card slot, hidden under a plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a proper shutter key is a bigger problem here than on the Galaxy Mini, considering the Galaxy Fit's autofocus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens at the back has no actual protection against getting scratched in your pocket. There?s no flash of any kind either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has a textured non-slip finish. It doesn?t quite affect the actual grip but makes the device a little more appealing. The matt finish is fingerprint-proof but the thin grooves do tend to gather dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill has got a tiny nub to prevent it from getting muffled when resting on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone, the mouthpiece is the only thing to note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1350MAh Li-Ion battery and the SIM compartment. You shouldn?t expect any miracles in terms of battery life. Android phones are power-hungry creatures and, as we saw with the mini, the low-res screen isn?t enough to make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Fit easily gets you through a day of really heavy usage, which is, by today's standards, quite a good achievement. Sparing use might even give you a two or three day interval between charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670 is a friendly little phone that handles comfortably. The all plastic build is acceptable ? the important thing is the phone feels durable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The poor screen resolution is the thing to consider - though it isn't a deal-breaker for the intended audience. Even the limited app compatibility won't be that much of an issue for people coming from feature phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like recent Samsung Galaxy phones, the Galaxy Fit runs Anrdoid 2.2.1 Froyo out of the box. It will, however, eventually get updated to Gingerbread. As usual Samsung has thrown its TouchWiz UI overlay, which not only makes the icons look pretty, but also improves general usability. There are four buttons docked at the bottom of the homescreen, which stay there even when you open the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This little fellow, like any true droid, supports up to seven homescreen panes, which can accommodate every widget and pack of icons you?ll even need. However, if you don?t need all seven of them, the unnecessary ones can be deleted. You can also rearrange the panes as you desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the notification bar down reveals the Android notification area. It is majorly overhauled from the stock Android one and holds five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and rotation-lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button while on the homescreen lets you add variety of content on it (a press and hold on the homescreen does the same thing), add or delete homescreen panes, change the wallpaper or quickly access the settings menu. Live wallpapers are supported as well with only one coming preinstalled and many more available in the Market. The contextual menu has shortcuts too for search and notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically, the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in vanilla Android). List view is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu panes can be rearranged just like the homescreens ? pinch to zoom out and you can rearrange the current panes or add new ones. The icons in the panes can also be rearranged to suite your personal needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature in this version of Samsung?s TouchWiz launcher is the built-in task manager. Complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently active apps, it saves you the need to install a task killer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took some benchmarks with the Galaxy Fit to see where it stacks against the competition. Some of the usual ones we use weren't compatible with the QVGA resolution so they are missing here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now those number might not sound impressive, but real life performance is an altogether different matter. Due to the low display resolution the Galaxy Fit had no issues delivering very fast performance and we were really pretty happy with it. It won't lift mountains but will operate without breaking a sweat in your day to day life.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A great TouchWiz enhanced phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung Galaxy Fit is plainly said, excellent. It has unlimited capacity and all the functionality you could want. The contacts application displays contacts stored in the SIM card, in your Google account or in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz interface has been at work in the phonebook bringing some special features. Instead of just flick-scrolling the list of people in the phonebook, you can search the entries by either typing the name of the person in the search box or by using the alphabet scroll at the right side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit also packs the quick contacts feature, which first appeared on Android 2.1. Using a single click, it lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email a contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange. There are many other details that you can assign to each entry, such as numbers, email addresses, IM, organization, and more. Clicking the plus sigh on the right adds another field of that type, while the minus sign deletes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main contact list view hides some useful shortcuts too. Swiping your finger to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer. The side-sweeping shortcuts are part of the TouchWiz UI and work in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit handled calls without any hassle. The reception and in-call sound were alright and we didn?t experience any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works beautifully. Tap a digit and it searches both contact numbers and names for it. If more than one contact is found, there?s a number and an arrow, which show you the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is situated within the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, which can be filtered to show only certain type of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Fit. It received a good mark and will let you know you have an incoming call in most loud environments. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich messaging experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging application is quite straightforward. It has a new message button and bellow it are all the received messages organized in threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same swiping functionality found in the phonebook has been integrated here as well. A swipe to the left starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application-specific search lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap and hold on a message and a context menu brings up options such as edit, forward, delete and lock as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. Once a text is copied, you can paste it across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the name or number and choose from the list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to a text message automatically turns into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email is can be handled either by the standard Gmail app or the generic email app. The Gmail one supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email application is used for all your other non-gmail email accounts and supports multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz UI in the Galaxy Fit features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit comes with the Samsung home-baked keyboard preinstalled. Despite the smaller screen resolution, this keyboard feels comfortable to type on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you flip the phone on its side, the virtual keyboard automatically switches to the landscape mode, which is much bigger and more comfortable to use. It covers most of the screen however, leaving room for only two lines of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is also available and works quite good if you are in quieter environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has generously included Swype for an alternative input method ? we covered it thoroughly in the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S review and we won?t go into so much detail here. Swype is a life-saver on the smaller screens (such as the one of the Fit) ? you don?t have to be very accurate with your swyping, which makes text input faster and easier. It?s only that, much like with any other text prediction method, it has to support the language you want to enter text in.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android gallery on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit comes with the stock Froyo gallery. It offers the good ol? functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient ? just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. Online albums at Picasa show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also organize the photos by date via a button in the top right corner which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to multi-touch support pinch zooming is also enabled on the Galaxy Fit but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player on the Samsung Galaxy Fit can handle 3GP and MP4 video files. DivX/XviD support is missing, but at least we had no problems playing videos at up to WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos wouldn?t play, but would you really need those on a QVGA resolution screen? The Galaxy Fit isn?t designed with video playback in mind, especially on that low-resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface itself is as simple and as it could possibly be ? there almost isn?t one. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in the Samsung Galaxy Fit is blessed with the TouchWiz UI as well. You can sort the music using the sorting options, which are neatly displayed in a tabbed interface. Among the options are current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music experience on the Galaxy Fit can be enhanced, thanks to the included equalizer in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also available. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What?s even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing missing is the fancy Disc View from the Galaxy S lineup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670 audio output can be described as decent at best or average at worst, but that shuold still be more than enough for most of its customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an external amplifier the smartphone is slightly on the quiet side, but it achieved some great results all over the place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hit that the performance takes when headphones are connected is quite substantial though - stereo crosstalk spikes and intermodulation distortion rises. Not to mention that volume levels drop to below average levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An average 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Equipped with a 5 MP autofocus camera at the back, the Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670 can take photos with a maximum resolution of 2560&#x445;1920 pixels. Unfortunately, there?s neither a flash nor a shutter key to aid you when your using the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the camera?s shortcomings, the user interface that comes along with it is touch-friendly and has great built-in features such as smile shot, preset scenes on-screen guidelines and panorama mode. It's basically the same interface you get on a Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a 5MP snapper, the camera on the Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670 is decent. Noise levels are low and there?s a decent amount of detail in the photos although you can see smeared detail in various places, probably due to the noise reduction algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos usually turn out with pleasing colors and contrast. If you haven't got a camera with you the Galaxy Fit will do the job and capture the moment but compared to a Galaxy Ace it just fails to impress. And keep in mind that once it gets a little dark outside the Fit will be completely useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also shot a couple of macro shots with the Galaxy Fit. It doesn't do well in under 10cm so you better not push it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit lacks touch focus which isn't a complete deal breaker but coupled with the lack of a hardware shutter key does make the device feel inadequate while shooting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670 enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670 in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the Galaxy Fit produces images with nice warm colors but it lacks in the contrast department, ending up short of the HTC Wildfire S and the Galaxy Fit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Samsung Galaxy Fit offers video recording too, but as it?s only QVGA at 15fps, we wouldn?t use it for anything other than MMS (and maybe not even that). The video recorder?s UI looks similar to the camera?s interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a real downer that a device with a 5 MP camera (which is still considered a good resolution in smartphone terms) and a 600MHz processor doesn't even do VGA video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the untouched video sample from the Samsung Galaxy Fit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit is ready for worldwide roaming with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity pacakge offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Buetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo enables Bluetooth file transfers, so there?s little else to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit doesn?t pack much internal memory (158MB is downright low for app installation), but it comes with a microSD slot with supports for cards up to 32GB. Thanks to Android Froyo you can install compatible apps on the SD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy Fit hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good browser, but no Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device. It?s fast, generally bug-free and really easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Fitmalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit browser supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and multi-touch pinch-zooming. The browser also supports text reflow ? a moment after setting the zoom level, columns of text align to the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is big enough to handle complex pages well, though the text isn?t as sharp at low zoom levels as it is on phones with higher resolution. Regardless, it?s still readable and panning and zooming are fast so the Galaxy Fit scores a good mark in web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the Galaxy Fit is running the Flash-capable Android Froyo, there is no Flash support in the web browser. The situation is quite similar to the LG Optimus One: the processor is either incapable of handling Flash content (or it?s disabled due to performance issues).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit has the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash support. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but you have to live without them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with the calendar app. It has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app is decent and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. But you don?t have the Stopwatch, the Timer and World Clock options. Still you get a Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Few applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung filled the Galaxy Fit with a few of their home-brewed applications and we really appreciate their work. Most of them are quite useful and can be updated via Samsung Apps ? the secondary app repository on your phone. Whenever Samsung updates any of the current apps or widgets, or releases new ones, you?ll find them here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub combines messaging and media sharing ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android market fun is somewhat spoiled by the lower resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit is running the latest version of Android and this is where the true power of Android comes from. You can download thousands of apps for whatever you can think but the Galaxy Fit suffers compatibility issues due to its sub-par QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS through Google?s eyes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit packs a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about four minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires cellular data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is on board, complete with Navigation, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though, and it relies on Internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Fit doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also bear in mind that much like with the browser - the QVGA screen resolution struggles to display the content on the display and you'll see a very crammed screen with bordering on unreadable content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit is yet another attempt by the Android army to storm the lower-end smartphone market. Placed right between the Galaxy Mini and the Galaxy Ace, the fit tries to deliver a solid smartphone performance at a very reasonable price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we are obviously still not at the point where this could be achieved without cutting quite a lot of corners. The low resolution screen is one, but there's also the lack of Flash support, the poor video recording and the lack of flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, expecting a device like the fit to match the capabilities of a Galaxy S smartphone is probably just being greedy. The bangs and whistles are for the high-end, while the Fit should be doing the basics and we have to admit it's doing that pretty well. You get tons of apps to organize your everyday life and fill up your free time, a relatively good camera and full connectivity package, so the general package is worth its price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, if you're out for the ultimate bang-for-the-buck low-end smartphone there are plenty of other options out there. You could even consider dumping Android all together and go look for tech satisfaction elsewhere. Let's check out some of the competition the Galaxy Fit faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with some in-house rivalry we give you the Mini, the Ace and the Gio. These Galaxy droids aren't as much of direct competitors to the Fit as its immediate neighbors in the Samsung portfolio, but unless your budget is really strictly set you should definitely check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mini offers an even lower price tag but falls short in the imaging and display departments. The Gio prevails in the display battle, but loses ground in imaging. The Ace offers the best of both worlds, but as you could imagine it comes at a higher price.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC has a strong contender to match the Galaxy Fit. The Wildfire S offers a solid UI experience with HTC Sense, a slightly better 5MP snapper, premium finish and most importantly - a 3.5" HVGA resolution (320x480 pixels) display. Unfortunately that one will cost you more than the Fit, so the choice is not as straightforward as it may look.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally we come to the Nokia C6-01, which is the Symbian contender in this range. If the Symbian quirks don't bother you (and the upcoming Anna update is really substantially reducing those in number) you get a way better 3.2" nHD (360x640 pixels) AMOLED, an equally well-equipped connectivity package and a fixed-focus 8MP camera with 720p video recording. With this one you are really getting way more hardware for the same price.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Fit gives the user a good all-round experience and it is a good starting point for your journey across Androidland. After a while you will know, which parts of it are too limiting for you and you would know what to look for when you upgrade. In the meantime you will probably feel pretty happy about forking the cash on this one.</paragraph>
