			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tablets are basking in well-deserved attention and manufacturers know they need to try hard and make their devices distinct and memorable. Truly unique gadgets are hard to come by these days - especially in Honeycomb land. Which is perhaps part of the reason why iPad is still the one to beat. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 3G is in for a challenge, and up for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortly after launch the Galaxy Tab 10.1 was blessed with a custom user experience, called Touch Wiz UX, which literally puts more color into Honeycomb, offers a good selection of customizable widgets and most importantly tries to ease your way into Android for tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet this tablet?s main advantage remains that it?s the most portable 10? slate to hit the market. It's thinner even than iPad 2 and good 42 grams lighter than Apple's frontrunner, while still promising to match its battery performance. And that's no mean feat since tablets are going hard after netbooks, so they need to back their portability with battery longevity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 10.1 has a dual-core NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor, a bright 10.1" PLS TFT display of WXGA resolution, a premium set of connectivity options and plenty of storage space. Check out the full list of things going for (and against) the Galaxy Tab 10.1 3G below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are bringing their A game in the Galaxy Tab 10.1. Not that it should be judged by sheer size but the company's biggest tablet is fit to be in charge and meet the competition head on. Whether it's watching films, browsing the web, gaming, video-calls, or imaging, this is one of the best-equipped tablets out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen quality, the added TouchWiz UX functionality, the good battery and excellent media make it a must-see. The whole package looks like the right mix of style and substance, but we just won't rush to a verdict. The Galaxy Tab had a promising start in our preview. With all the finishing touches in place, it's ready to give its best. Head on past the break to see what the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is made of.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 retail package hardly brings any surprises. The box holds the device, a USB cable, a two-piece wall-mount plug and a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The package is about identical to what you get with most other tablets out there with the headphones not even present everywhere, so we won't be deducting any points of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tablet is impressively slim and deliberately underdesigned. A certain litigant-happy competitor did vehemently disagree on the latter but to no avail. In tablets, design is minimalist bordering on non-existent. They all look alike. It's not the XOOM, the Flyer, or the Playbook that were in trouble though and we can see a point there. Yes, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 looks like the iPad2. In a good way or a bad way? You decide. Certainly not in an illegal way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's ultimately important though is that the Galaxy Tab looks good, and being slim is a big part of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like premium materials like steel, aluminum and the likes but choosing plastic instead saves a whole lot of weight. This is one of the most important things when considering the purchase of a slate - you wouldn't want your hands to go numb when hodling it. The larger 10.1 Galaxy Tab is a good 35 grams below the 600 mark. Its nearest competitor, the Apple iPad 2, is 42 grams heavier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit, though that the iPad 2 does have a minor edge in terms of overall feel. The Galaxy Tab strikes back with its easier handling due to its taller and slimmer body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just bear in mind that all that shedding of grams and millimeters hasn't made the Galaxy Tab 10.1 the friendliest of gadgets. Yes, it's portable - impressively so for its screen size - but you'll still need a place to prop it up when your hands need a break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is built around a 10.1? PLS LCD screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. The image quality and viewing angles make it one of the best screens to find on a slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like the smaller Galaxy Tab 8.9 screen better, but that's down to the higher pixel density. We were pleasantly surprised to find that both tablets are readily usable outdoors, even if colors do get a bit washed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we're still at a point where being able to see anything on a tablet screen outdoors is considered a great achievement (and we'll probably stay there until the Galaxy Tab 7.7 finally hits the shelves), so the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is almost as good as it gets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 has no hardware controls whatsoever ? with the Honeycomb OS based solely on touch controls, the slate just doesn?t need them. All you get is the front-facing camera, embedded in the bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack and the SIM card slot. The SIM card sinks quite deep and is a bit tricky to push and eject but that's not something you'll need to do daily. The top is the only part of the device to feature any kind of hardware controls with the volume rocker and the power key near the left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 uses a proprietary 30-pin connector for charging and connectivity. Both the USB host and HDMI TV out require adapters to work and at this point we cannot confirm any of them will be part of the standard package. An SD card reader is another optional accessory which will probably have to be purchased separately. Be warned that you'll need a power cable to use the HDMI TV-out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aesthetically, a single connectivity port is the preferred solution - and the Galaxy Tab 10.1 has the functionality after all - you'll just need to get the adaptors. To be fair to the competition though, they have the connectivity features available straight out of the box. The Motorola XOOM comes with dedicated microUSB and HDMI ports, along with a microSD card slot (fully enabled at last). The HTC Flyer has a microUSB port and a memory card slot, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to note at the bottom is the microphone pinhole. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesn?t have telephony enabled, but the mic is needed in voice and video chat. There are a bunch of Android apps that offer that kind of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two short sides of the slate (left and right when you hold it in its default landscape orientation) have nothing but a speaker each. The placement of the stereo speakers on the opposing sides seems the better solution than what we saw on the Galaxy Tab 8.9, where they were right next to each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The journey ends at the back of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, which features the 3.15 megapixel camera lens and its LED flash. The flash will probably make better use as a torch than provide serious shooting assistance. Then again, nobody buys a tablet for its imaging capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 3G is powered by a 7000 mAh Li-Po battery, which Samsung say should keep it going for 9 hours straight. We can't complain about the battery life the tablet gave us in our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Used occasionally on normal daily tasks, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 can easily last 3 days. On a fully charged battery, we surfed the web for a couple of hours via Wi-Fi, played a few games, watched videos and installed apps, all the while testing the tablet for our review and the charge dropped below 50% in the evening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess you can easily get a full day out of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 no matter how hard you push it, which is not bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's briefly look at the accessories available for the Galaxy Tab 10.1. The keyboard dock is pretty convenient packing a lot of hardware shortcuts and allowing comfortable two hand typing. It would have been even better if there was an additional battery inside it to power you on, but no such luck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a great carrying case you can get for your newly-bought Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (or 8.9). It does add to its weight and thickness, mind you, but sure looks nice.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Welcome TouchWiz makeover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 10.1 shipped unskinned initially, but Samsung managed to push its TouchWiz UI to its through an update a couple of months into its live. This means that you'd be getting a few home-backed enhancements in addition to the regular Honeycomb 3.1 stuff. We actually found those to be quite helpful, but you shouldn't expect any changes that run as deep as on the Galaxy S smartphones. These are more of minor touches that should help the Galaxy Tab 10.1 stand out in the Honeycomb crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video of the user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one can be noticed right on the homescreen and in the app launcher ? the taskbar at the bottom is no longer static. A swipe upwards flips it to its side to reveal six shortcuts. Clicking on any of them opens a widget window that you are free to move around the screen and it stays on top of everything until you close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the taskbar-docked shortcuts are the proprietary Samsung apps. They include the in-house task manager, world clock and the PenMemo app, as well as a calendar, calculator and a music player. All of them except the task manager have shortcuts to their respective fullscreen apps. Most of the functionality is overlapping anyway so you might not need to go there too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been modified too to include the connectivity toggles that we?ve come to know from the smartphone edition of TouchWiz. They offer more functionality than the stock Honeycomb quick settings - including GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth controls - which saves you the extra effort of entering the extended settings menu. The rest of the toggles are Notifications, Sound, Auto-rotation and Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons at the bottom left corner also have a new addition. We don?t know how many people other than reviewers and developers will find the new screenshot button useful, but it doesn?t hurt having it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the other buttons has remained unchanged ? back, home and task switcher is what you get with stock Honeycomb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search shortcuts (voice and text) are in the top left corner of the homescreen, while the app launcher and homescreen edit buttons stay in the top right. In-between is the final change brought by Samsung ? the dots indicating the number of available homescreen panes and the current selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has seen no modifications at all, but there are plenty of preinstalled apps that cannot be found on other tablets ? Social Hub, Music hub, Pulse reader, AllShare, Polaris Office, Video player and My files. Some of the other apps like the music player and the calendar have been modified as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the traditional Android benchmarks on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and it did pretty well, matching most of the Tegra2 gadgets currently available on the market. The important thing here is the Galaxy Tab 10.1 offers great performance and Android experience and it's what really matters.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is fairly straightforward on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger screen has allowed some modifications that reduce the needed clicks for some tasks and thus improve usability. Samsung also changed some plain Honeycomb icons with TouchWiz ones, but nothing beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field on the top left corner as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or deleting the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options - edit contact, import/export, join with another contact, send or print a namecard, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Galaxy Tab 10.1 has no telephony, clicking a phone number opens the messaging app and tapping an email address or a website automatically launches the email app or the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is done via a popup window, where you the available fields organized in groups, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a field that hasn?t existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom field names aren?t available at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing worth mentioning - for every contact you get two tabs - the standard Info one we already talked about and History. The latter shows all the latest activity with this contact (emails, messages, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the Galaxy Tab 10.1 results from our traditional loudspeaker test. The device fails to impress getting just an average mark that may disappoint some users. You can find more about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the messaging app above. It is pretty simple and lets you send texts to one or more recipients. MMS are not enabled, it's just a simple SMS composer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging app layout is similar with the phonebook - on the left you get contacts, on the right are the conversations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two email clients<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes with two optimized email applications out of the box ? one for your Gmail and one to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single email the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and check mail manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s basically the same excellent treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few further optimizations permitted by the large screen and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Now this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won?t notice any big difference when handling short emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s auto correction and auto capitalization available and you can enable sounds on key presses. There?s no haptic feedback so it?s not perfect just yet, but the overall experience is pretty decent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Honeycomb image gallery shows pictures in full resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 10.1 gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of functionality, but it has too been tweaked to feel more comfortable on the large screen. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper right corner holds shortcuts to the camera, image details or extra settings (like make available offline for Picasa albums).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are browsing a specific album/date/location/tag the shortcuts change a bit ? the extra settings shortcut is replaced by a button that starts a slide show. The icon in the very top left corner becomes active and clicking it brings you back to the full gallery view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 gallery shows the images in full resolution so you can see the finest available detail in your images. If you want to zoom precisely to 100% just use the double tap gesture. If you feel like it you can zoom in even further - up to 200%, though we can't quite see why you would need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more fancy way to zoom in and out, but we are not sure if it is quite handy. Just put your thumbs (any two fingers will do - it's just that it only feels natural with thumbs) on a picture and tilt the tablet up or down and the photo will start zooming in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer-based trick is available here too - in the default view, albums with more than one photo inside have a cool 3D shadow effect when you tilt the slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music Player with TouchWiz magic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have blessed the Galaxy Tab 10.1 music player with a custom interface, which we find more functional than the stock Android one, even if it lacks the impressive cover-flow-like browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now sort your tracks by album, artist, song, genre, folders, composer or year. Playlists are here too and there are automatically generated most played and recently added lists. Naturally, there?s also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) the interface splits into three screens - the filters on the left, the album in the middle and the now playing track on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the song name brings you to a dedicated now playing screen where you have a repeat (one or all) and shuffle options as well as a setting to add the currently playing track to favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers are available too, along with various sound effects like concert hall, music clarity etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name. Strangely enough though there are no quick pause or skip controls right there so you need to open the music player every time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stock Android Honeycomb doesn?t have a dedicated video player app so Samsung decided to write one of their own for the Galaxy Tab 10.1. Allowing for thumbnail, list and folder view modes, it?s a pretty functional application. There?s also searching so even if you fill that ample storage with short clips you should be able to find the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 10.1 supports DivX/XviD files out of the box. Performance with higher-res videos is great ? it played almost all 720p videos like a champ. We threw DivX and XviD files we had at it - all up to 1080p resolution. The Galaxy tab 10.1 handled them smoothly and hassle-free. That's really impressive achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now there are a few restrictions though - the MKV files are a no-go and there is no subtitle support. Plus we experienced some issues with the MP4 files with very high bitrate (mostly resolutions above 720p).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Flawless audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are used to seeing excellent audio output from tablets and yet the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 still managed to nicely surprise us. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 does better, or at least as well as, any competitor out there (and yes that includes the iPad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In collaboration with an active external amplifier the Galaxy Tab produces perfectly clean output. As you can see from the scores below, there's not a single weak part of its performance. The only thing that's not really praiseworthy is its volume, but in this case quality is valued higher than quantity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the best bit is that the degradation, when headphones are plugged in, is the lest we have seen of any device we have tested. Stereo crosstalk rises a bit, but that's about it. No distortion, no frequency response deviation, nothing else. And the volume levels are pretty here, so it's definitely a solid performance overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3.15 megapixel stills and 720p video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A 3.15 megapixel main camera capable of doing 720p videos and a 2 megapixel front-facing snapper is what you get with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. Given that tablets aren?t the most useful devices for taking snaps it?s probably as much as you are going to need anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, the two cameras are mostly there to provide the functionality needed for video-chatting and some augmented reality apps or games and the possibility to snap a label or two as a memory aid comes as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is an oversized version of what you find on the Galaxy S II with the available settings on the left and the shutter key and the video/stills switch on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go a few samples to show you the image quality of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 camera. We found it to be pretty good for the 3 megapixel league ? low noise, plenty of fine detail, accurate colors and good balance between contrast and dynamic range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, the 3 megapixel camera on Galaxy Tab 10.1 does a splendid job, but that's understandable - you have much more room and processing power here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is not much different, really. There are fewer options available here, but the layout is basically the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos are top-notch, full of detail, low in noise and generally, nice and smooth. There?s plenty of information and the only drawback you might consider is the mono audio recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the Galaxy Tab 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a 720p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 3G is a match to most of the HD capable flagships and tablets and our video compare tools is here to prove it. Of course there are a few 1080p capable camcorders using the same hardware so there is room for improvement. We'd suspect that the more demanding Honeycomb was the reason why 1080p is absent here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is well equipped in terms of connectivity. There is proprietary 30-pin USB connector for computer connection, but there is no USB charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you get GPS radios plus 3G speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no microSD card slot. The 16/32/64GB of internal storage is plentiful and Mass Storage is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an adapter for that. That way you can connect card readers, USB flash drives and other compatible devices to your tablet and access their contents through the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy a separate HDMI adapter and connect the tablet to your HDTV with a regular cable.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A better browser thanks to Android 3.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. With full Flash support, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 gets an edge over the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser. The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field - typical Android - which scores another point for the Galaxy Tab 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks and History have their own screen with a split-screen interface. In History you can check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There?s also a most visited and today tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn?t need any extra software ? you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also auto-complete for forms and passwords.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though so you have to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for the Flash performance ? the Galaxy Tab 10.1 does great at 360p and 480p videos right in the browser. Things are a bit more complicated with 720p Flash videos, though. You get a couple of choppy seconds at the start, but performance smooths up after that. Moving around isn't particularly fast too, but still the Flash performance is now way better than on the previous Honeycomb version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, if you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause stutter when panning, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off all together).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A good set of organizer apps are available on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, including the Polaris Office that can both view and edit documents. It has really nice user interface with 3D arcs for the recent docs, internal file browser, intuitive interface, etc. It supports both internal and web storage (via Box.net).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing and editing all kind of doc, sheet and presentation is hassle-free. You can also read PDF files, but naturally you can't edit them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you think of organizer features on a smartphone (or tablet) the first app that comes to mind is the calendar. It has five different types of view: daily, weekly and monthly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is optimized for big-screen use and is pretty intuitive. You can naturally set as many alarms as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock app is full of eye-candy. You get an animated globe where you can pick time zones or cities, there are country flags, day and night animations, etc. Once you try it, you'll definitely like it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are a few apps provided by Samsung for the Galaxy Tab 10.1 worth mentioning - eBook, Memo, My files, Pen memo and Photo editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eBook reader comes with one book for free - The Marvelous Land of Oz. naturally you can add books stores, buy books from them and they will appear on your virtual shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eBook reader is quite capable - it allows you to highlight or underline text, change the font size and page color, search the book and put bookmarks. There is even text-to-speech feature with settings for speed and pitch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo is pretty simple notes application with interesting interface - you get your notes as sticky note on a wooden board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Files is a familiar app - it's the Samsung powerful file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pen memo does almost the same as the memos, but in addition to the text it allows you to draw pictures and offers some extra option as colors, background, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Photo Editor offers some basic picture edition tools - selections, rotate, resize, crop, color effects and adjustments, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS with Google Maps Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn?t experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, any money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and way easier on your data plan and with the Navigation itself becoming available in more and more countries 3rd party SatNav apps are facing extinction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it?s available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn?t do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market ? there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The additional applications are the heart of every modern mobile platform. The more and the higher-quality they are the better the market prospects of their OS. For the Galaxy Tab 10.1 this is a two-sided tale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a customized Android market interface that lets you browse and search the hundreds of thousands of apps there quicker than ever before. The productivity is probably the best there is on the market and gaming is second only to the App store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the large portion of those is still not exactly tablet-friendly. Some just don't have WXGA versions and stretch their WVGA ones (which isn't too bad, but certainly isn't ideal) and some are simply performing terribly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were quite surprised to find that apps that run fine on single-core WVGA handsets and that we would?ve assumed to be a walk in the park for the Galaxy Tab 10.1 would stutter quite heavily. Luckily we do notice a major improvement, compared to the early days so things are obviously moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's hardly any wonder - the Android slates now account for a third of all tablet sales out there, so coders have every reason to show their commitment. Plus with cooler and cooler Honeycomb slates coming up (not to mention the improvement in the platform itself), things are bound to improve even further. And quite rapidly, if Android's smartphone history is anything to go by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's own store called SamsungApps is also on board. There you can get a lot of free apps for your tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not easy being an Android tablet these days. The iPad is the supreme ruler of the market, leaving but a small part of it to the huge number of competitors. So even if the Galaxy Tab 10.1 manages to successfully tackle a few dozens of devices running the same platform plus a few exotic competitors, the best it can hope for is go at the number two spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not necessarily bad - Rome wasn't built in a day and Samsung is certainly under no illusion that it will manage to knock Apple of its tablet perch with a single device. Apple took a gamble with slates, it worked and now they have the advantage in a rapidly expanding market, while the competition is playing catch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we are not saying Apple cannot be beaten at its own game - most recent smartphone history suggests otherwise. We are just saying that some serious preparation is required if such a thing is to happen. Convincing customers that you can beat the iPad hardware or software isn't enough - you need to convince them that you can match or outdo the Apple user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And from where we stand after we completed the review the Galaxy Tab 10.1 can be a pretty strong argument for both Samsung and Android. And it's not just the really good PLS TFT display with Gorilla Glass, the powerful Tegra 2 chipset or the excellent connectivity (though those all score points for it). It's more the case of the Honeycomb 3.1-running slate being the most complete offering we've seen from the Android camp to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-made TouchWiz UI takes the already great Honeycomb functionality another level up, while the 3.1 Android update brings an overdue performance boost. Meanwhile app numbers are growing by the day and as we know apps are the heart of every tablet ecosystem. And if the ones you need haven't come out in tablet flavor just yet the excellent video player will still make your Galaxy Tab 10.1 great fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that's the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 summarized - it?s a nice tablet that no one would mind having around. What's even more we doubt anyone will regret spending ?500 (for the Wi-Fi only version) ?600 (Wi-Fi + 3G) on it. If you aren't quite convinced though, you might want to try some of its alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently released LG Optimus Pad costs a good deal more than the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and has no fancy TouchWiz UI to brag about, but comes with one of a kind feature - stereoscopic 3D video recording (it also does 1080p videos in 2D). If you are really into this thing, then the Optimus Pad might be your only option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus Pad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first Android Honeycomb tablet - Motorola XOOM - has significantly dropped price and got a series of updates, which turned a beta-feeling device into a decent deal. You'd still be getting Android 3.1 experience (minus the TouchWiz extras) for ?100 less, so it's definitely worth checking out. Of course you won't be getting the marvelously slim waistline or the 565g weight of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 with the XOOM, but on the upside, you'll be receiving cheap memory expansion through the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola XOOM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EeePad Transformer by Asus has a few tricks in its bag too. It brings a 10.1? LED-backlit IPS LCD display with scratch protection, a memory card slot, Waveshare UI and, most important of all, the optional keyboard dock that turns it into a droid netbook. Not to mention that it also comes at a lower price.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally, if you have nothing against the Apple way of things and you are ready to sacrifice a few feats (Flash playback and, proper file management and multi-tasking spring to mind) for bigger and better variety of apps and smoother performance then you can get the 16GB Apple iPad 2 3G on exactly the same price as the Galaxy Tab 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad 2 3G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 can stand its ground against just about every one of its competitors quite well. Plus it certainly is fun to use and that's a quality valued above everything else in this class.</paragraph>
