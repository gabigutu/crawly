			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 is helping the company cross into the 64-bit era. A catchy enough headline for a sequel that's not overly generous with the upgrades. On second thought, a new generation chipset (lower-midrange but still), a more recent OS and LTE are not a package to frown on. Especially considering that the upgrade costs the same - if not less - than the predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 1S was a huge success with reasonable specs at an unbelievable price. The stakes are high for the successor and the Xiaomi Redmi 2 isn't trying to fix what wasn't broke. It carries over the sober looks losing some body fat without sacrificing the screen real estate and resolution. LTE connectivity on top of the original dual-SIM capability is welcome too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The elegant MIUI has been further refined as well. Xiaomi have redesigned the launcher, but the logic and functionality are intact - in a bid perhaps to keep both newcomers and upgraders happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi unveiled an upgraded 16GB model with 2GB of RAM just a month after the official announcement of the Redmi 2. It is slightly more expensive, but heavy multitaskers will certainly find the premium is worth it. The very early adopters may have been disappointed by the fast hardware upgrade, but we'd better have it than not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, availability is an issue - not so much finding a vendor but the potential complications about servicing and warranty. The upside is you're not paying over the odds for hardware - you would normally need to reach much deeper in your wallet to get a package like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a price that's hard to beat and a realistic level of equipment, things are looking good so far for the Redmi 2. Find out what happens next right after the break!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xiaomi Redmi 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 comes in a simple box made of recycled paper. The package contents are just as basic: you get a compact 1A charger and a microUSB cable. That's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you order the Xiaomi Redmi 2 at XiaomiShop.com, you'll also get a flip leather case, a screen protector and a touch pen free of charge.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi Redmi 2 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 has the same 4.7" HD display as its predecessor and a more powerful battery, which however didn't result in increased size and weight. The Redmi 2 is actually a tad more compact and lighter than the Redmi 1S. At 134 x 67.2 x 9.4mm, it weighs 133g, which is a good 25g lighter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The reduced weight aside, the Xiaomi Redmi 2 looks a lot like its Redmi 1S predecessor. The curved corners of the new model make it look even more compact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The red backlighting of the capacitive keys is a trademark accent of the Redmi lineup and it works pretty well here. The black front is actually a piece of Corning Gorilla Glass, while the removable battery cover is manufactured from high-quality matte plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The removable cover fits tightly but can be easily popped open, no squeaks when handling the phone. Holding and using the Xiaomi Redmi 2 is quite pleasant. The matte rear cover provides excellent grip, while the reduced body weight and curved sides help both the feel in hand and pocketability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 boasts no special materials and premium finish, but is solidly built and looking quite durable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Xiaomi Redmi 2 looks quite like its predecessor and the layout if controls is identical. It uses capacitive buttons beneath the display, with the familiar red backlight. Although the left key has the old Contextual Menu icon, it actually opens the task switcher. Upon a long press, it will show the advanced menu, if available. You can configure long press for all three keys, but the options available are just three: Contextual Menu, Task Switcher and Close App.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary 2MP camera is next to the earpiece, along with the proximity and ambient-light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone is completely bare. On the right, we find the silver-painted volume rocker and the power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is on top of the Xiaomi Redmi 2, while the microUSB port and the primary microphone are over at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera lens is placed between the LED flash and the loudspeaker grille. The secondary microphone is also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover of the Redmi 2 is user-removable and lets you reach the 2,200mAh battery. Unfortunately, the two micro-SIM cards and the microSD card are confined by the battery, and therefore not hot-swappable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 features a 4.7" HD IPS display with a pixel density of 312ppi - those are identical specs to what the Xiaomi Redmi 1S has. Corning Gorilla Glass 2 provides a degree of protection against cracks and scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A closer look at the display matrix of the Xiaomi Redmi 2 reveals a standard RGB arrangement of an LCD panel's sub-pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the Xiaomi Redmi 2 is bright enough at 100% with good contrast and colors. At 50% brightness the image quality stays the same. Unlike with the Redmi 1S, dropping the brightness slider doesn't reduce the brightness sharply.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is improved over the Redmi 1S but still rather mediocre.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi is allowing user control over color temperature and saturation. Unfortunately there is no Glove mode this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there is an option to prevent accidental unlocks of your screen, while the phone is in your pocket. If enabled, you won't be able to unlock the screen while something is covering the proximity sensor. This would take a toll on the battery though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi has a 2,200mAh battery powering the Redmi 2, 10% more powerful than the Redmi 1S, and it is removable. We ran our battery test and the Xiaomi Redmi 2 scored an overall rating of 55 hours, which means you can count on two full days if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and video playback daily. The Redmi 2 does slightly better than the Xiaomi Redmi 1S (51hrs) but overall it's rating is about average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out our detailed Xiaomi Redmi 2 battery life test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 comes loaded with wireless connectivity features. We kick off with the Cat.4 LTE option (up to 150Mpbs down, 50Mbps up), and there is regular 2G and 3G connectivity, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 2 is a dual-SIM phone with dual standby. One of the cards can be connected to an LTE or 3G network, while the other will work on GSM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes Wi-Fi b/g/n and Wi-Fi Hotspot capabilities. There is no dual-band support, unfortunately. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0 LE, but no ANT+ or NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 2 relies on a standard microUSB 2.0 port for charging and wired data connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we do miss here is a wired TV-out option either via MHL or SlimPort. USB on-the-go and USB Hub are supported, which means you can use USB memory stick, mice and keyboards. You just have to purchase the USB OTG adapter separately (about $2).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is also support for GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou, plus an FM radio with RDS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface - MIUI v.6 runs on top of Android KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 2 runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat skinned with company's latest MIUI v6 launcher. The MIUI ROMs have been around for a while and are fairly popular among the Android community. Xiaomi's customizations run very deep and replace everything including all Google services, but the good news is you can still get those from the Mi Market app. The models sold outside China come with the entire Google package pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi MIUI v6 completely overhauls the user interface, though it keeps the same layout and operational logic. Xiaomi has put a huge effort to make the UI flat and simplistic as possible and yet keep the entire functionality intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we dig into details, here's quick walkthrough of the MIUI v6 on video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen moves the clock widget over the top left and lose the centered circle with shortcuts. All you need to do is swipe upwards to unlock. If you want a quick access to the camera - just swipe from the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen widgets are no more, but you can always set protection such as PIN or password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom by default, but you can dock up to five items. You can have any app there or even folders with multiple items if you will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no app drawer - anything you install pops up on your homescreen, which can have unlimited panes. There're no shortcuts and the usual routine of removing icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will uninstall the corresponding app. There is a pop-up for confirming the action though, so you can't accidentally uninstall apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen widgets are available, too - tap and hold on the homescreen, then choose Widgets. There are few options available, but of course, you can get even more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen effects are available and you can change themes, too. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile (you can disable changing the sound profile from settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two semi-transparent tabs - the first one hosts all notifications, while the second one (swipe left to access) offers non-customizable quick toggles and a Settings shortcut. Unfortunately you can't bring the toggles page with two-finger swipe from the top as it is with other Android devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi provides its own cloud service for content syncing between devices. Each Mi Cloud account is granted 5GB of free storage. You can use it to backup contacts, messages, your entire gallery, call log, notes, settings, voice recordings, Browser content (history, tabs, webapp data) and your music library. Sounds familiar? Yes, indeed! Xiaomi's sync and backup service shares lots of similarities with the Apple iCloud. There is even a free Cloud Messaging option that allows Xiaomi users to exchange messages over the internet connection instead of being billed for SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you signed in with your Mi Cloud account, you can opt for the Find device function - a handy feature in case you misplace your Xiaomi Redmi 2 or someone steals it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Google Now pre-installed. The Redmi 2 comes with basic Google package - Play Store plus Google sync of app data, contacts, and browser. You can, however, get every other Google app from the Play Store, including Google Now and Maps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 2 is running on the Snapdragon 410 chip with a quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 306 GPU and 1GB of RAM. There is a slightly more expensive Redmi 2 model with 2GB RAM and doubled internal storage, but that's yet to become officially available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 410 is the most affordable chipset from the new 64-bit generation Qualcomm offers. It should provide a slight performance boost over its 32-bit predecessor, the Snapdragon 400, but don't expect miracles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 explores the raw multi-core processor performance and it supports 64-bit architecture already. The Redmi 2 posted a respectable score for its class, absolutely on par with all the other Snapdragon 410 devices. It is obviously faster than the four Cortex-A7 cores within the Sony Xperia E3, but no match for eight of those as in the case with the Redmi Note phablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound AnTuTu 5 benchmark adds RAM and graphics to the equation and shows pretty much the same results as the GeekBench 3. All Snapdragon 410 devices are doing fine, the Redmi 2 even scores a hair better than the Galaxy A chaps. The octa-core Redmi Note scores noticeably better though, while the Snapdragon 400-running Sony Xperia E3 is behind the curve.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we ran the compound BaseMark OS II test, which in addition to CPU, GPU and RAM, tests also web and system performances. The Xiaomi Redmi 2 does great here beating all other devices but the Galaxy A5 and A3. We should note that the Galaxy A3 has an edge over the rest S410 devices as it runs on a lower-resolution qHD screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BaseMark OS II also provides separate scores for the single and multi-core processor performance. Quite expectedly the octa-core Cortex-A7 in charge of Redmi Note is topping the charts, while the quad-core Cortex-A53 is doing as well as the others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've tested the new Adreno 306 GPU before and it didn't show any improvement over the previous generation Adreno 305. It is weak on the offscreen T-Rex test, beaten by the Adreno 305, but shows equal performance when it comes to Open GL ES 3.0 Manhattan offscreen benchmark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Onscreen performance matters the most, of course, as these GPU were made to work best with HD or sub-HD screens. Xiaomi Redmi 2 and Galaxy A5 run on 720p resolution these tests, while the Xperia E3, Galaxy A3 and HTC Desire 510 feature sub-HD screen thus the better fps output.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the Basemark X GPU test crashed every time we tried to run it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, let's check the web browsing performance. The Kraken benchmark is all about Java Script and the Redmi 2 is doing very good, while the compound BrowserMark 2.1 shows it is behind the curve. Of course, if you are unhappy with the default web browser, you can always switch to Chrome or other alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapdragon 410 chipset is doing OK in the Xiaomi Redmi 2, providing a proper experience for this price and hardware segment. Sure, some phones are better and the Snapdragon 400 older phones are on par or a hair behind, but at least the Redmi 2 offers better futureproofing with its 64-bit processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And for what's worth the MIUI 6 and the Android KitKat run blazing-fast and lag-free on the Xiaomi Redmi 2, as all of its system apps and popular heavy-duty office apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook share a single app although there are two shortcuts. The app has been updated with the new flat looks, but everything else is the same. The app uses a tabbed interface - recent with dialer on the first and the contact list on the second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports Smart dialing and works great - it's looking up both names and phone numbers so you always find what you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 2 supports voice call recording and it can do it automatically on each call if you like. You can also assign an answer gesture, pre-define quick responses upon reject, there is even support for internet calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more call settings if you dig deeper into the menu - flip to mute the ringer, turn on/off the proximity sensor, lock automatically once slipped in a pocket, it can even mute calls from unknown numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 scored a Very Good mark on our loudspeaker tests, meaning you'll hardly miss any calls and notifications. The loudspeaker sound quality seems great and Xiaomi has definitely improved its work since the Redmi 1S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all bubble-styled conversations organized in threads, with New Message and Search keys at the bottom and a settings button next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will automatically turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Gmail app pre-installed, but you can opt for Gmail or Inbox, if you prefer, from the Play Store. There generic Maill app is capable of handling all kind of mail accounts, including Gmail, and it can handle multiple Exchange, POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI offers Google keyboard by default - it has always been pleasure to use and is one of the most preferred Android keyboards out there. On this screen the keys are comfortably large in both portrait and landscape mode. There is support for gesture typing, handwriting and voice input.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 comes with a custom Gallery app with slightly updated flat looks compared to MIUI v5. It defaults to your camera roll with two shortcuts at the top that will take you to album view of your local images and album view of your cloud pictures. You can't change this view, nor can you customize the default folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - share it, delete it, enter edit mode or just get more info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate, fisheye, doodle) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MIUI music player is a custom app with a well-laid out, easy to navigate interface. It features a two-page layout - the first one is cloud music, similar to Google Music service provided by Xiaomi. It has similar subscription plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second page has your own local and cloud music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has cool effects, transitions and transparent elements, especially on the expandable Now Playing section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi's Music app offers customizable equalizers with a few default presets already available for use. You can also try Xiaomi's MiSound enhancer, which comes into play when you use headphones, and especially, a Xiaomi-branded set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can edit song info and you can also enable automatic song info download in case the ID3 tags are empty. Lyrics can be downloaded, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has an FM receiver and supports radio recording. There is a sleep timer as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 2 does features a separate video app, but you can also use Explorer to find some videos the default app doesn't recognize (but are still playable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface is very basic but there is rich video codec support. It managed to play everything we threw at it (including MKV and WMV files). The AC3 audio codec is supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles and pop-up play are not supported by the MIUI's video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Xiaomi Redmi 2 performance is pretty good and markedly better than any other Xiaomi phone we've tested in the past. The smartphone posted excellent scores all over the field and its volume levels were well above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes a very minor increase in stereo crosstalk leaving the other readings unchanged. That's a pretty solid performance no matter how you look at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the detailed results so you can check them out for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 2 features an 8MP camera, equipped with a LED flash. Its interface is fairly simple, though has changed a bit since MIUI v.5. Now you have three scrollable pages - the default one shows the viewfinder with a virtual shutter, flash trigger and front camera key. The top page has 12 filters with live preview, while the bottom has advances modes such as Panorama, HDR, Skin Tones, Manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manual Mode offers you settings for white balance and ISO manual settings. The Face Detection switch is within the additional settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xiaomi Redmi 2 unit came with a defective camera lens and was able to focus only at objects at about 2 meters distance or less. The camera resolves a decent amount of detail although and manages to keep the noise levels low. The smartphone's camera renders colors well - slightly oversaturated, but not too much to create an unrealistic effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, Feb 19: We got another Redmi 2 unit and snapped new camera samples. There were no issues with the lens, so we were able to do all of our tests properly. The resolved detail is decent, but not impressive, while the dynamic range is OK. There is little noise, the colors are slightly over-saturated, but still quite close to the realistic ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without making the contrast too low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama shots are available too - you can capture both landscape and portrait panoramic photos at about 180 degree. Shooting is easy but the stitching takes a while to complete. The end result is rather disappointing though - the landscape shots come in 2300x400px pixels while shooting in portrait mode results in the somewhat more usable (but again far from great) 2000x800px.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the panoramic images are stitched well, the quality and resolution are below the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo comparison tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 is more than capable of carrying its own weight in our Photo Comparison tool. You can see it puts up a good fight against the other snappers we've tested and comes on top even against some far pricier options.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 2 camcorder has the same UI as the still camera. It supports time-lapse videos with customizable snapping interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 is capable or recording up to 1080p@30fps. The bitrate of the samples is 15 Mbps, audio is captured at 96 Kbps with 2 channels (stereo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The detail levels in the 1080p videos are average, colors and contrast are good and the framerate consistent at 30fps. The dynamic range is low and there are visible compression artifacts due to the low bitrate. Finally, the automatic exposure is too harsh and may ruin the overall video quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a 1080p video we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the 1080p untouched video sample taken straight off the Xiaomi Redmi 2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 enters our video comparison too. There are plenty of 1080p camcorders you can compare it with. It resolves average detail, while contrast and colors are good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MIUI Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 comes with the feature-rich MIUI Browser, now with new flatter looks. It does a great job browsing, syncing with your Google account, supports downloads, there is a night mode, too. It is as almost fast as Chrome, but does not support Find on Page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, it has a built-in Reading mode, which isn't available in Chrome. It enlarges the text font and strips away unneeded elements, leaving only the article you are reading in focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the MIUI Browser, even though updated, still had issues with some pages and our battery-test browsing script. That's why we suggest you install Chrome, at least as a backup, just in case you need to avoid crashes or you need to find something on a page. Plus it can sync with your Google account easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 offers a great file managing app called Explorer, but there is no document viewer/editor pre-installed. There are plenty of free options in the Play Store (even ones made by Google), so this shouldn't pose a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MIUI v6 also offers a Security app. It can scan your phone for malware, manage your blocklist, manage or restrict your data usage, configure battery behavior, clean some RAM, it can also manage the permissions of your installed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom and now flat Calendar looks good, syncs with your accounts including Google, and offers Day and Month views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standard sound recorder, notes, flashlight, calculator, clock, and weather apps, among others, that are a given in any self-respecting Android package nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the new Compass app. It has very nice and clean interface, shows the directions and doubles as level. If you lift the phone up then you'll get a nice augmented reality view with real-time directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps isn't installed on your unit, you can get it for free from the Android Market. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially neat thing that you should definitely check out if you haven't already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever else you may be missing, you'll find it in Google's Play Store.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The big question when dealing with a sequel: is it worth the upgrade? The big question when Xiaomi is involved: are these guys running a charity?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should all be used to it by now and this is not about Xiaomi's asking price for the Redmi 2 compared to similarly equipped phones. It's about how a new-generation 64-bit processor, LTE connectivity and an updated OS version cost exactly zero. That's' right, at certain shops the Redmi 1S and Redmi 2 cost the same. And we may as well be cool about it and don't count the bigger battery, a subtle re-design and a new MIUI version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if there's a place we wouldn't want to be, it's that of someone who just recently bought the Xiaomi Redmi 1S. That should pretty much answer the big question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For just about ?130 you are getting a 4.7" IPS display of 720p resolution, a capable Snapdragon 410 chip with a 64-bit processor, a good enough 8MP camera with 1080p videos, LTE connectivity, dual SIM support and Android KitKat. Does it sound like an incredibly tempting package? No. But at that price, it's a steal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've been seeing a lot of similarly equipped offers lately. The S410 is the new midrange favorite and affordable LTE is in high demand. The Redmi 2 is just another one hopping on the bandwagon. Its key advantage is the price. A similar package by a top-tier maker will cost double or more. The ones that come within its budget are clearly inferior in terms of specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly the biggest rival that the Redmi 2 faces is the Meizu m1. Costing about the same, the m1 offers a higher-res 13MP/5MP camera combo, faster 1.5GHz CPU and a slightly larger 5" screen. It is yet to come to the market though and by the time it starts to ship abroad, the Redmi 2 might have already received its 2GB RAM refresh.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Prime will give you a slightly bigger display and a better selfie camera, but a qHD LCD. The HTC Desire 510 has even lower FWVGA resolution. On the plus side, it offers fresh design, more speed (because of the screen lower resolution) and amazing battery life. It runs Android KitKat with Sense 5.5, but comes with less capable camera department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime ? HTC Desire 510</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's affordable Xperia E3 is priced closely but is inferior in every key aspect: lower resolution display, previous generation Snapdragon 400 chip, no LTE on the dual-SIM model, half the storage at 4GB, and lower-res cameras. Good performance and battery life, plus deep integration with some core Sony services are the high points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia E3 ? Sony Xperia E3 Dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No groundbreaking specs, no record-breaking performance, the Redmi 2 isn't a phone to top anyone's wish-list but one that will get the job done - and even over-deliver for the asking price. It's the kind of device that easily explains Xiaomi's growing popularity outside the traditional Asian markets. Definitely worth a try, especially if you can get a hand on the 16GB version with 2GB of RAM. Although it will certainly be more expensive, the big question to ask Xiaomi isn't how much it's going to cost - but when it will be available around here.</paragraph>
