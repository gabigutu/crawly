			<paragraph>Samsung decided to compete with the popular LG Cookie not in one, but in two ways. We already gave you S5600 and now it's time to direct the limelight to Samsung S5230. Join us as we take a short stroll with the 3-incher S5230 and see what what it has to offer to the mainstream segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5230 is obviously a no-nonsense phones design to appeal to the masses with both its price tag as well its looks, which remind of some the company's top mobiles. Targeting the midrange market Samsung S5230 joins the ranks of cheap touch phones and one thing's for sure. It's not thrown into the fight unprepared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S5230 is stylish, runs on TouchWiz and can read your written words. Besides it's a casual snapshot taker with even the oh-so-popular Smile Shot mode and it can easily make your portable music player redundant. That seems enough for us - let's see with what weapons Samsung are planning to take on the midrange touch wars.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5230 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung S5230 is not something revolutionary; it even cannot be described as evolutionary. It's just the right kind of feature mix targeted at the midrange market with surgical precision. It seems an even more direct competitor to the already available LG Cookie than the Samsung S5600, but the real head-to-head will take place only when the phone gets out there and starts doing some actual sales. And it's almost destined to sell well, thanks to its expected low price and the helpful nifty little things that make it special.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page for a walkthrough of the Samsung S5230 exterior and ergonomics. Just bear in mind that it's still a rather early pre-production unit and changes before the actual product is out are quite possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5230 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 actually is a quite compact device - and light as well. It's more rectangular than say? the S5600, which gives it a more pronounced boxy appearance. You will however notice the resemblance to some other Samsung phones - Omnia being a fine example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3-inch display is the main attraction of the S5230. It has 240 x 400 pixels resolution just like most other touchscreen displays by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is circled by a silvery frame, which gives the phone a sexy and stylish look. In fact it makes it very similar to the Samsung i900 Omnia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware keys. Dead center is the Back key, accompanied by the receiver keys on both its sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 is modestly styled with the only exception being the plastic plate with brushed finish, which hosts the hardware keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung S5230 there is a simple volume rocker and a protective cap hiding the proprietary Samsung port that's used for connecting the charger, data cable and headset. Unfortunately, the port is not the microUSB variety that we found on S5600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5230 right-hand side is just as simple with only two keys available here - the camera key and the HOLD key, which is used to lock and unlock the touchscreen. Other interesting stuff on the right is the lanyard eyelet and the stylus nest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Samsung S5230 is quite modest again - as is the whole phone and also looks similar to the Omnia's. However it's made of some really not fingerprint friendly plastic, which may look pretty but it collects every print from every single touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3 megapixel camera stands alone at the back without a LED flash presence - just like the slimmer LG Cookie. There's no auto focus either - but that's probably expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel gets you access to the easily visible SIM card slot. Unfortunately, that's how you get to the microSD card slot as well. The memory card slot is neither easily visible, nor hot swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the Samsung S5230 is pleasingly compact touchscreen phone. It's not the slimmest one around, and the old-school styling and USB port might suggest that it's an older development by the South Korean company - it's as if it has 2008 written all over it. Still, we are content with its ergonomics and design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are welcome to the next page as we explore some of the more interesting software applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz UI is quite a likely guess<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have been using the TouchWiz user interface on all their touch phones ever since Samsung F480 Tocco. Quite expectedly, the Samsung S5230 comes with a slightly updated version of it much like the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH, Beat DJ and S5600. Lively, colorful and pleasantly thumbable - the latest reincarnation of the TouchWiz UI has inherited all the virtues of its predecessors and adds some interesting new stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The heart of the new UI is the widgets - convenient mini-applications for customizing your home screen. Some of the widgets are more practical such as the calendar or the world clock, even the image gallery or the mp3/radio player, while others are just for fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, all the widgets are stored on a bar on the left which you can toggle by using the small arrow in the lower left corner. You can pick which widgets to display by simply dragging them onto the display and placing them where you want. If you want to remove any of them, all you need to do is drag them back to the bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new feature on S5230 is the side scrollable home screen. This means you can have up to three different home screens on which to place various widgets on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the ability to sort your widgets on different desktops, you can also have a single wallpaper for both three homescreens - much like in Android OS. That way if you have an appropriately sized panorama image, you'll see different parts of it on the three screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving some the wide-three-part home screen aside the S5230 unit we had didn't differ much from what we've already seen in other Samsung devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung promised a new touchscreen feature called Gesture Lock to be present on both the S5230 and S5600. While we didn't find it on the pre-production S5600, it was available on the S5230 all right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gesture Lock enables users to simultaneously unlock the phone and open a menu item or an application, or even dial a contact, just by drawing an alphabet letter on the unlock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each alphabet letters from A to Z can be used as a gesture to perform the various actions in question. For instance, you can use it to start apps like the music player, messaging menu, the web browser, Java apps or the dialing keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the main menu hides the new Photo contacts feature. It uses a fake 3D environment and shows up to 8 contact pictures in an arc. You can scroll them up and down and dial the one you want. It's a rather fashionable interface, but we doubt that it will turn practical for everyday use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still check out some interface screenshots to get an idea of the rest of phone features - file manager, organizer, calendar and FM radio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The simple messenger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung S5230 has a large 3-inch touch display supporting hand-writing recognition. Writing a message can be done in three ways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is the traditional one - typing by the virtual 3x4 keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second is to use the stylus and write the letters on the screen. We've hardly seen a user take handwriting recognition as a primary input method, but may be it's just us. In general, the handwriting recognition is very intuitive and in most cases recognizes the letters correct.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally comes the on-screen QWERTY thumboard that we missed on the Samsung S5600 (hopefully due to its pre-production status). With Samsung S5230 switching between the 3x4 keypad and the QWERTY one is seamless thanks to the built-in accelerometer - just turn the phone sideways.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung S5230 is exactly the same as in the S5600 and hasn't been much altered from the M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a dedicated widget, allowing quick access to the full version of the application by only a single tap. You can also start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, etc. but it also packs three options thanks to the DNSe sound chip - widening, dynamic and surround effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized including fast forward and rewind, just like the S5600. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice finger-optimized gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is only one image gallery in the S5230 and it is an inherent part of the file manager and accessing it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. The sweeping is really responsive and fluid and even the screen is a resistive one, it doesn't ruined the fun at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has slideshows and a nice accelerometer-based feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone on its side (plus, of course, you get automatic rotation of the photos by changing the device orientation).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A surprisingly nice snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 features a nice 3 megapixel camera with fixed focus and is capable of taking photos with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does not have auto-focus, but it sports the nice Smile shot feature. Basically when you turn it on, pushing the camera button doesn't immediately take a picture. On the contrary - it just starts monitoring the framed face and as soon as the person smiles (or at least grins), the handset takes the shot for you automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual pictures taken with the camera are a nice surprise - they have nice details and colors. The noise reduction however is a bit aggressive at times. We certainly don;t like the contrast at this stage but the image processing however is certain to go under more changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression of the captured photos is enough satisfying and you can see it from the samples below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly one of the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities are very poor - only QVGA video at 15fps. But for a cheap and budget touch phones, it is enough. The competing LG Cookie doesn't offer more too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had an argument here in the office which phone is better - is it the 3G and GPS-equipped S5600 or the S5230, which has a larger, higher-res screen. Of course we didn't reach an understanding but hopefully end users won't be victims of similar hesitation. Samsung will probably release the two at different price points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The comparison between the LG Cookie and the Samsung S5230 finished quite even too. Both handsets pack similar hardware and quite optimized touch software. While the Cookie comes with a document viewer, the S5230 offers more interface features - the Gesture lock, Photo contact manager and camera Smile shot. Still, our personal subjective opinion is that the Cookie is far better looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day, the choice between the two will be up to you. The retail price will surely have a saying too, but for now we don't really know what it will be.</paragraph>
