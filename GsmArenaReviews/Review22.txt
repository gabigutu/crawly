			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s either a job that pays the rent or a job to love, not both. If the Nokia 6303i had this mentality it would be in big trouble. Fortunately, there?s nothing to worry about here. It?s a handset that knows its place and does the job it?s paid to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i classic is an "i" phone ? but not the Apple variety. Call it a facelift or call it a sequel ? it?s a sub that comes in to keep sales strong. Some minor improvements are implied to an already well-rounded product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance however, it seems that Nokia has cut features rather than add them. The 3.2MP auto-focus camera with VGA video @15fps has been downgraded to fixed-focus unit and QVGA video capture @8fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the boost to battery life makes quite a difference. Plus, 3 megapixel is nothing to write home about ? with or without autofocus. The retail package was updated too ? you get a 2GB microSD card instead of 1GB and the phone supports cards up to 16GB (the original 6303 managed just 4GB cards). And then, there?s the updated user interface as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, some trade-offs have been made, but when you add them up the 6303i inches slightly ahead of its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks is one thing that Nokia didn?t change on the 6303i classic. The metal body with neutral styling (not too extravagant, not too formal) was great the first time around and the phone did and still does look dressed above its pay grade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the web, reading email and even posting social networking updates are standard features in today?s handsets. But before all that, the Nokia 6303i classic is a phone ? as in press a few buttons and make a call. Remember?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing Nokia 6303i classic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Nokia 6303i is standard issue stuff. The charger is of the mini variety, there?s a short (and we mean, really short) USB data cable, and a one-piece stereo headset. The 1050 mAh battery is here as well, while a quick start guide and a manual round out the contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also found a 2GB microSD card and a voucher for 25 songs from the Nokia Music Store ? not bad for such an affordable phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6303i classic 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i classic measures 108.8 x 46.2 x 11.7 mm with a volume of 57 cc ? precisely the same dimensions as the 6303 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone hits the sweetspot of comfortable handling. Neither too small, nor too big - it fits nicely into any pocket but it?s not too small to use. It weighs just 96 grams ? but don?t let that fool you. It?s metal all over - the back, the front, even the keys, and has a solid, expensive feel to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The i-modification of the Nokia 6303 classic is not a facelift so on the outside the 6303i and the vanilla 6303 are identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is centrally placed right above the Nokia logo up front. The ambient light sensor is right next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the 6303i classic is great in terms of both contrast and color rendering, and it has a very wide viewing angle. Sunlight legibility is an absolute treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has QVGA resolution and can display up to 16M colors on a 2.2" diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the display, rocker-styled buttons on both sides of the D-pad accommodate one soft key and one call key each. The navigation frame of the D-pad projects nicely over a roomy confirm key. All controls are comfortable to use and occasional mispresses are very rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front has a slight curve at the bottom, which raises the end row of the keypad slightly. This makes keys a bit harder to press, but it's nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star and hash key are smaller and slightly less comfortable but that seems a sacrifice to the curvy styling of the device. Otherwise, the keys are well defined and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display backlighting and the white keypad illumination are very strong. However, in typical S40 style, there?s no option to set the brightness manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of Nokia 6303i classic is pretty bare, as Nokia crammed everything into the bottom. The top houses just the power button, which is recessed enough to rule out accidental presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right and left side of the handset don't have much to show either: the left side is completely empty while the only thing on the right is the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the 6303i is where all the ports are - the microUSB port hidden under a plastic cap, a 3.5mm audio jack, charger plug and the lanyard eyelet. This means that the phone will have to be upside-down in your pocket if you've got the headset plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our round- trip of the 6303i classic with the rear. The back features a dual LED flash right under the 3-megapixel camera lens. Just next to it is the loudspeaker grill. One complaint we have here is that sound does get muffled when the phone is lying on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is metallic alright and the feeling of touching the cold metal is unusual in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the battery cover reveals the powerful Li-Ion 1050 mAh (BL-5CT) battery. The Nokia 6303i classic charges both through the standard charger plug and the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i wasn?t with us for long, but in two days of use the battery didn?t budge, it still reads full. We made about 10 minutes of phone calls, about half an hour of shooting photos, then music and games (about 30 min each) and then there was quite a bit of general testing and prodding of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This economy of power use makes the Nokia 6303i classic a very reliable handset ? it?ll run for days on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card compartment is housed under a hinged metal bracket and swapping it is quick and easy. The microSD card slot is accessible from the side of the phone (you will still have to remove the rear cover though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solid feel that only a metal frame can provide is refreshing and scores big for the 6303i classic, but the plasticky keys on the front spoil that impression somewhat and it?s hard to call the phone a looker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone handles nicely and navigation is quite straightforward. Fingerprints are not a problem, but the gap between the front and back seems like a good place for the 6303i to gather lots of dirt.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i classic employs the Series 40 6th edition user interface. The environment is very familiar but there are still some visual novelties since the 6303 classic. While we are pretty much in favor of any visual tweaks, we would have also liked to have seen a few new features as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A document reader is where the S40 still loses out to its Samsung competitors, while the multi-tasking and vastly better multimedia tip the nod in favor of the Sony Ericsson A200 platform. Nokia on the other hand are still relying on their vast market share with its feature phone user interface and prefer to deliver a familiar user experience rather than try and create a revolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two points of view to this approach for the two large groups that buy these low-end and lower-mid-range featurephones. The first is that if you want a simple call and text device a familiar interface will be better than a higher spec?d handset with a more confusing UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second large group of customers that buy similar phones are the ones looking for better bang-for-buck deals, the bargain hunters. Those will probably be better off with some of the competition?s offerings as they have a richer list of features. But anyway, let?s skip to the actual interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly redesigned standby screen of the Nokia 6303i classic features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings, such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time occupying the top part of the screen. The fonts have been noticeably enlarged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is also available. It now consists of not four but three sections that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. Normally, one of the areas is reserved for the Shortcut bar which grants instant access to favorite functions denoted by their respective icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is that pressing the end key while the keypad is locked brings up a clock that shows time and date. It's something of a poor man's tap-for-time feature that's usually reserved for more expensive phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the redesigned homescreen the 6303i classic also comes with a refreshed menu. Now in some submenus there is a More button which hides the rarely used features. This makes finding your way around the menu a bit easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a new view mode for the main menu, displaying a single icon at a time, much like in their S30 ultra-low end handsets and first generations of the S40 UI. Icon can be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original order inconvenient. Unfortunately, the icons again lack animation as we have seen in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the lack of multi-tasking support, you can't just minimize a Java application (such as the Opera browser) and go read a new message.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A decent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia 6303i classic stores up to 2000 contacts, which isn?t as good as unlimited storage but should do for 99% of the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice extra touch is the Find-on-Map option which locates the contact's address on the new Ovi Maps for S40 application if it is entered correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log on the Nokia 6303i classic is unchanged. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony doing well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and in-call sound cause no concerns with the Nokia 6303i classic. Like almost all current S40 midrange phones this one also features Voice Clarity which is another way of saying that it applies some sort of background noise suppression during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is loud and clear on both ends and you will have zero trouble with your calls. Vibration strength on the 6303i classic is pretty decent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary as it is fully speaker independent. The Nokia 6303i managed to recognize a large number of the commands we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has not included any Smart dialing features, so all typing a number would give you is the "helpful" option to start a countdown timer (interpreting the numbers as hours, minutes and seconds) but won't search through your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 6303i classic is a Good performer. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Passable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is certainly up to the task. The Nokia 6303i classic is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing a SMS/MMS message is a nice experience with the Nokia 6303i classic well defined keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well enough organized and you won?t spend too much time finding your way around it. You enter a few letters of a contact's name and then click match. This brings up a list of matching contacts and selecting one prompts you to choose either a mobile number or an email address, then it will shift to the message body automatically where you can start typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the email client was extremely easy. It just required an email address and entering and confirming the password, the 6303i classic took care of the rest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is pretty boring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 gallery is way behind what virtually all other platforms have to offer. The Nokia 6303i freshens it up a bit, but a new look and improved functionality are due if it is to look up-to-date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the Nokia 6303i offers only a single view mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. At least zooming in on a single picture is pretty comfortable now with the zoom in and out shortcuts placed on the middle and right soft keys. It?s also faster and smoother than we are used to seeing from most of its predecessors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia 6303i classic looks decently and has a good set of features. It has decent looks and all-round functionality, including album art, and a fair number of formats are supported. The theme can be set to match that of the rest of the phone, integrating it very well with the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled with the D-pad. Besides all the typical functions, the music player of Nokia 6303i classic also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be active for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on Nokia 6303i classic is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers all basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can make the handset to search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is hardly worth it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s make this clear ? the Nokia 6303i classic is by no means a device that should be considered by anyone who is serious about watching videos on their mobile. The combination of a small screen, a low number of supported codecs and a less than fully-featured video player hardly creates the ideal conditions for pleasurable viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 6303i classic is only compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, fast-forwarded or rewound and that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality does great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though it is not a music phone, Nokia 6303i classic has pretty good audio quality. It also pulled off pretty decent total harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings in our audio quality test were also impressive comparable to the best in class. The earphone loudness is about average, which will be more than enough for most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the acceptable price tag of the Nokia 6303i class, we find its audio output nothing short of excellent. Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 3.2 MP camera has lost its autofocus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like its predecessor, the Nokia 6303i classic is armed with a 3.2 megapixel camera for image resolution of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels. However this time the auto-focus has been dropped for one of the recent extended-depth-of-field fixed focus units. The LED flash is also rather inadequate, only really usable with close range objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but reasonable given the mid-range spot. The available settings include white balance, three quality levels going from basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6303i camera doesn't rank among the top 3.2 megapixel shooters in terms of image quality. In favorable lighting it produces decent images ? a bit oversharpened, but with good contrast and acceptable color rendering. Noise levels are normally quite high and the aggressive noise reduction that kicks in takes its toll on resolved fine detail. The lack of detail in images is a major weakness, while darker areas can be troublesome as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera speed isn't remarkable and saving files is average too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia 6303i classic. You can check out what that test is all about here. As we mentioned, you can easily see a pinkish spot in the center of the frame when you shoot lightly-colored subjects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording: why did they bother?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Things get even worse when we talk about video recording. The Nokia 6303i classic manages QVGA resolution at 8 fps which is simply unacceptable for any purpose, even for MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity not the 6303i classic element<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i classic connectivity options are somewhat limited by the lack of 3G support. GSM support is only tri-band as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least EDGE and GPRS are here but there is no Wi-Fi nor GPS, which might be rare in this class but are pretty much standard in the one right above it. Bluetooth version 2.0 is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring data, is also present here but the lack of hot-swappability reduces its usability considerably.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser suffers from slow data speeds, lacks Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i classic has an integrated WebKit-based HTML web browser. We guess that rings a bell. Apple's Safari and Mobile Safari are based on WebKit, as well as the browser for the Android platform and the Palm Pre. It's safe to say that Nokia 6303i classic is in good company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not to say however that you will get a similarly good user experience as those are very different devices we are talking about here. However the WebKit background helps the browser render pages accurately and that is a vital improvement over the previously used web browsers in S40 devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i native browser still has its shortcomings though. There are obvious indications that the hardware is not quite up to the job ? for one, scrolling is quite slow. Flash is also not supported - there's some rudimentary support but it's just enough to display certain banners, not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most other S40 phones recently, Nokia 6303i classic also comes with the Opera Mini browser preinstalled. It speed up that browsing with its ?Up to 90% compression?, which is vital when relying on slow non-3G connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia 6303i classic is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events can be set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303i classic calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too. There's an additional converter that gives you clothing and shoe size equivalents worldwide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are into sharing images, video and audio files with your buddies straight from your handset have a look at Ovi Share. After a quick sign-up process, selecting files for uploading is easy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app is limited, you can only browse your and your friends' uploads. For general browsing you'd need a web browser (the built-in one works quite well). Bear in mind that even 3 megapixel photos can cost you quite a bit at the end of the month if you're not on an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application offers Google Search initially, though other search engines might be available depending on your country and region. Searching launches the web browser, which makes this app somewhat useless. Or rather, it would have been if the browser had this functionality built-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By now you're aware that the 6303i classic doesn't have built-in GPS, but the Maps app can work without one - you can browse the maps, look up addresses, plan routes, but you'll have to do without voice guided navigation. Furthermore it won't give you your general location based on Cell-ID like Google Maps does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of games on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are several games preinstalled and they are diverse enough to help most people kill a bit of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is Bounce tales - a fun, cartoony platformer that follows the adventures of a blob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brain champ is a collection of simple puzzles - a variant of Simon Says, simple math questions (2 + 4 = ?). The puzzles may be simple but since you're running against the clock, things can still get pretty competitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>City Bloxx is the well-known block stacking game. Be warned, it's addictive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Block?d is a version of the popular Bejeweled game where you have to bring blocks with matching colors together in order to discard them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High Roller casino can help you satisfy your thirst for gambling, without forcing you to spend cash in a real casino.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rally stars will appeal to racing fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the end is a Sudoku puzzle game. Its inclusion is no surprise - these puzzles have become very popular. If you're a Sudoku buff, this may very well bethe most used feature on the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, we?re at a place we?ve been before. Some things have changed but essentially it?s the same experience. We?re pleased with the refreshed UI, but that?s pretty much it for the updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price is the attention grabber for the Nokia 6303i classic ? given its metal build. The 6303i is very good at what it does but S40 UI has inherent limitations which you may need to consider. They are unlikely deal breakers though ? at this price point and for the intended target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But before you run off to the store, here are several alternatives you should consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6303 classic is an obvious option ? it?s got an auto-focus camera and VGA video recording @15fps. The smaller microSD card and the older UI aside, the 6303 classic has the same features as the 6303i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you could go with the newer series that succeeded the classic line. The Nokia C5 is a bit pricier, but puts GPS and Symbian in an equally compact package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could of course go for a phone from a couple of years ago. The kind that used to be top-of-the-line but now cost and do more or less the same as the 6303i classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U800 Soul b (if you can still find it in stores) offers some improved UI features such as Smart dialing and an office document viewer plus it has a 3 megapixel auto focus camera, 3G and a similar all-metal design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6303 classic ? Nokia C5 ? Samsung U800 Soul b</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchphones have gotten really cheap too, so you can get one for about the same amount of cash. The LG KP500 Cookie, LG GD510, the Samsung S5230 Star and even the Nokia 5230 fall squarely into this category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KP500 Cookie ? LG GD510 ? Samsung S5230 Star ? Nokia 5230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though a bit overpriced at the moment of writing, we guess Nokia 6303i still has its market segment ? it?s exactly what many people are looking for. It won?t make you feel guilty about spending a pile of cash on a gadget, but it?s not a cheap-looking compromise either.</paragraph>
