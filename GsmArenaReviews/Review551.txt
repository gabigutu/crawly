			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer kicked off IFA 2015 press conferences and definitely went all out with all sorts of devices. What got us by surprise however is their Predator mobile gaming devices - the Predator 8 and a gamer smartphone - the Predator 6. The latter is a beastly device with a ten core processor that promises to dominate the mobile gaming niche, so we decided to see if it has what it takes to deliver on that big order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other unusual device is a Windows 10 smartphone - the Jade Primo. It's rocking a Snapdragon chipset powerful enough to take advantage of Microsoft's cool Continuum feature. It allows you to dock the phone and hook it up to a large monitor, running Windows 10 on a big display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OEM unveiled an avalanche of new devices across most of its product branches, ranging from PC's and gaming hardware all the way to Android and Windows mobiles. The amount of new tech was so overwhelming that we are still catching up with our hands-on experiences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already gave you a glimpse of the Z630, Z530 and Z330, as well as their variants and some of the first Windows Mobile devices - the M330 and M230.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time for the company's two most interesting new smartphones. Both managed to pique or interest in its own way and so we naturally went back for a closer look.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Predator 6 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may or may not have heard, but Acer has ventured into the world of gaming hardware and with a flying start. A few months ago the OEM launched its Predator division, which is charged with the tough goal to deliver ultimate performance hardware and builds to the very nitpicky crowd of gamers. It is definitely a good move as far as market expansion goes, as the branch is growing at an exponential rate and does by definition entail lots of expendable income and freedom to go wild with hardware and visuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is exactly the motivation behind Acer's new Predator 8 gaming tablet and Predator 6 gaming smartphone. Both represent a new branch in the Predator family, which, just like DELL's Alienware and Republic of Gamers by Asus, started out in the desktop and laptop PC realm. Acer must definitely be doing something right as to facilitate this bold new expansion to the Predator lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Predator 6 might be a hardcore Android gaming device, but it is still a smartphone nonetheless, so we were naturally drawn to take a closer look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, the elephant in the room ? visuals. If there is one thing the gaming industry is instantly associated with, it would have to be captivating strong and aggressive visuals. What better way to draw the attention of gamers than a flashy shell, a lot of red paint and a brushed surface. Acer knows this all too well and consequently the Predator 6 definitely stands out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is actually quite a refreshing breath of fresh air to see some variation on the standard slab design that has been the norm for so long now. The Predator has character and a lot of it. The body is arched out at the back with strong angles, some quite unnecessary, but all so cool steep edges and grooves and a huge logo etched in on the back. It is definitely not something you would want to pull out during a business meeting, but in the right circles it is the definition of awe-inspiring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is nicely wrapped up by four distinct orange grills at the top and bottom, which all house speakers for the best possible audio experience. Otherwise the front is quite clean and only the earpiece stands out a little with its camera-like design. As far as materials go, the shell is mostly made out of metal and feels really premium. Handling is quite nice as you would expect, given all the extra edges to grip on to and holding it with two hands in landscape feels even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the phone are quite clean with nothing really getting in the way. A USB on the bottom, 3.5mm jack on the top and volume on rock controls on the right hand side ? that's about it. And now we get to the important part. Any gamer likes a flashy attire, but it is the internals that count and the Predator P6 definitely has the guts to impress. First up is the spacious 6.0-inch HD display. It puts the phone well into phablet territory, but also looks quite impressive in terms of contrast and sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the hood is a beastly MediaTek chipset ? the MT6797, more popularly known as the Helio X20. It is a monster and has a total of ten CPU cores inside, but before you get too excited, it is still a mobile chip and running all of them is not really an option of a number of practical reasons. The design is actually what is referred to as a tri-cluster. The Predator 6 has two sets of four Cortex A53 cores, running at 1.4Ghz and 2.0GHz respectively, as well as an additional two A72 cores, running at a whopping 2.5GHz. Those are the chips the unit will be utilizing to handle great loads ant the other clusters are there to offer a less power-hungry alternative for regular tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where our beef with the Predator 6 lies. While Acer has indeed done everything it can to equip it with the most-powerful hardware possible, it is still a standard ARM solution that will most-likely be fitted in a lot of other consumer devices in the future and not necessarily ones that will be marketed as gaming stations. This is in contrast to a more-custom approach, like what Nvidia does with the Tegra chip. That could actually give you more productive hardware, as opposed to just a flashy exterior and big marketing talk. But, we digress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the Predator's specs sheet is still quite impressive, featuring a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU, 4GB of RAM and a 21MP camera and to Acer's credit, it does seem to have put some extra effort into making a custom device, tailored for gamers. For once, the Predator 6 is equipped with a special haptic feedback system, so it can behave just like a modern console controller and immerse the player in the game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the software, it is already clear that the Predator 6 will run on Android, just like the Predator 8, however, Acer could opt to build a custom gaming-friendly experience on top of in, which could definitely boost sales. Last, but not least, when dealing with gamers it all comes down to content and Acer needs the right approach if it is going to give the products like the Nvidia Shield a run for their money. But frankly without a custom hardware platform to impress with, we doubt the Predator 6 and its tablet counterpart will ever become wildly popular.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The gaming-centered Predator line of mobile device was far from the only treat Acer had for us at MWC 2015. If you tagged along with the presentation then you surely noticed the impressive Windows 10 Continuum for Phones demonstration that was held on stage. The device that powered that particular experience is the new Acer Jade Primo and, you guessed it, it runs on Windows 10 for phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how is this phone any different from the other Acer Windows models ? the Liquid M330 and M320 and what makes it so special? Well, for one, it is a more powerful offer all around and packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC. It also has a bigger and better 5.5-inch AMOLED display and a nice 21MP camera with dual-LED flash. This can easily be considered flagship-grade material, especially in the Windows realm, where most mobiles tend to be underpowered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Jade Primo actually needs all this extra power for more than simply running Windows 10, which has already proven it can function quite happily on as little as 512MB of RAM. As demonstrated on stage, the Jade Primo is an ambassador to a new breed of windows devices that will be capable of achieving Microsoft ultimate dream of a full PC-grade experience within a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The project in question is called Continuum for Phones and is an exciting new feature in Windows 10 that will theoretically allow you to dock the phone to a keyboard, mouse and monitor setup and use it as a capable PC-grade device. This was actually showcased during Acer's presentation and it definitely managed to captivate imaginations and spring thoughts of a simpler tomorrow yet again. We say this because the concept is far from new. At least a few parties have tried to achieve similar results throughout the year, most-notably Ubuntu, which has been pushing an almost identical docking concept for quite some time now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Microsoft seems to be the first one to actually take the technology beyond the mere concept level. The idea is to leverage the power of the new universal apps that can seamlessly run across a range of Windows devices and create a scalable uniform experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the looks of it, it does work quite well and once Windows 10 becomes officially available for phones, there will be more and more devices like the Jade Primo that could act as a PC replacement. In order to do this, the Primo needs all the power it can get, definitely a lot more that most current Lumia devices have and more-importantly ? the proper hardware to support proper resolution digital video output. This is where the Snapdragon 808 comes into play and is truly utilized by the Jade Primo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the phone itself, it has a rather plain exterior, which is not necessarily a bad thing and if clean is what you are after, then it should be right up your alley. Materials and build quality are also perfectly adequate but nothing really special or premium. Just an ordinary-looking device, but one with an important mission of introducing Microsoft's concept of a more convenient future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the software, as already mentioned the Jade Primo runs on the eagerly-anticipated Windows 10. Consequently, it is, just as expected, in beta state and therefore not entirely usable. It did, however, run fairly smoothly, but most features were sadly rendered unusable due to the lack of an internet connection on the demo unit. Still, as already mentioned the Jade Primo is important for entirely different reasons, so the software was just as finished as it needed to be to properly show off.</paragraph>
