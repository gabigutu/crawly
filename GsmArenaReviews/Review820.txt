			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There haven't really been sparks flying between Sony and HTC. It doesn't look like a rivalry capable of producing the kind of ripples one would expect of a clash involving Samsung and Apple, or LG and Samsung. Yet, HTC and Sony have been contributing to the platform no less - and are the two brands that make Android look its best, both on the inside and the outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do know better than take this as a beauty pageant, don't you? These two have bigger things on their mind - and we don't mean world peace. Standard-setting build and finish are matched by just as premium internals. The very first flagships to break cover this year, these two still have what it takes to be season-shapers: connectivity, screen resolution, audio, imaging and processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There seem to be the right dose of respect each way but not without a dash of envy in those looks they throw at each other. After all, what we have here is probably the best Android has to offer in terms of industrial design. Two unibody smartphones by makers that have taken the skill of molding aluminum and metal and glass to an art form. Both have quality stereo speakers, great displays and both are powered by the cutting edge in chipset technology. The very latest Android experience is available right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sounds like a level field, but let's look at what may tip the scales one way or the other.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z2 over the HTC One (M8)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, even those pretty evenly composed lists seem to give the Sony Xperia Z2 the upper hand. A bigger screen (at pretty much the same body size overall), bigger battery, higher-res stills and videos and more RAM carry more value perhaps than a higher resolution selfie cam and an IR blaster. And even if the HTC One (M8) should turn on the offensive, the water-resistant Sony Xperia Z2 can always take it where the enemy wouldn't venture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of IP certification and the questionable choice of camera are potentially HTC's biggest disadvantages. On the other hand, 4K videos spell storage trouble while stereo speakers in a water-proofed body are no match for an identical setup where each has its own amplifier. There're a lot of things to consider - is it raw image quality that matters the most or is it image sharing and creative effects? Is it audio you care the most about or protection against the elements?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking to get the very best Android has to offer, these two are definitely in the running. In terms of style and feel, Sony and HTC are not making it easier on anyone. But hey, we would be disappointed if they did. Yet, there's nothing more subjective than good looks - we'll try to get them out of the equation (but not out of the story) and hope it's still going to be a tight game.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design, controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) and Sony Xperia Z2 are very close in terms of design philosophy, yet feel completely different - good for them we must add. Size-wise the two are neck and neck - and these are by far not the most compact of flagships, we'll chalk this one down to the front-mounted stereo speakers and not quite razor-thin bezels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Sony Xperia Z2 is slightly wider - and feels like it considering the angular shape - being slimmer doesn't help much. The HTC One (M8) is 146.4mm tall while the Sony Xperia Z2 is almost identical at 146.8mm. the same goes for weight, at 160g vs 163g respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 fits a bigger 5.2" screen and a pair of stereo speakers in virtually the same vertical size as its current opponent. The speakers are etched out of the sheet of (scratch-resistant) glass covering the entire front, and thus a lot subtler than the prominent grilles either side of the One (M8)'s screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opting for on-screen controls, both phones seem to have a patch of unused space below the display -clearly more of it in the HTC One (M8). The Sony Xperia Z2 has a "breathing" LED located under its top speaker. The front cam here is a 2.2MP unit. On the HTC One (M8), a status LED is underneath the speaker grille, with a 5MP front camera nearby for higher quality selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is sharp at the corners and boxy, in contrast with the ergonomically curved back of the HTC One (M8). Sony's flat, glass covered front and back are mounted directly on the steel frame that holds everything in place. The HTC One (M8) has its edges sloping toward the rear, shaping a gentle curve that fits nicely in the hand - even better with the cold touch of aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the material of choice of the HTC One (M8) - there're almost no plastic bits to be seen, Gorilla Glass 3 coating the screen. The brushed aluminum body is one of the hottest in business. The Sony Xperia Z2 is also built around an aluminum frame but none of it is actually exposed. All you see on the outside is scratch resistant and shatter proof sheets of glass. On the sides, the aluminum frame is treated to a soft-touch finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Controls</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On-screen buttons are in-charge of navigation on the HTC One (M8). There's a BoomSound speaker each side of the screen, each under its micro-grilled mesh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2's 5.2" IPS LCD Triluminos display with X-Reality engine is impressively sharp, never mind it has "just" 424ppi as opposed to the 441ppi of the HTC One's Super LCD3 unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pair of speakers on the Sony Xperia Z2 aren't individually amplified and the water-proofing is known to have taken a toll on the loudness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 also integrates the back, home and recent apps button into the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the HTC One (M8) feature a volume rocker and two ejectable trays for the nano SIM and microSD card. You'd need to use the provided tool to open them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2's sides are more densely populated: a two-step shutter button, a single piece volume rocker and the prominent power/lock button are all on the right side of the device. Above the trio of controls sits the microSD card slot under a protective flap. The left side has a longer flap covering the microUSB port and microSIM compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC One (M8) features an edge-to-edge IR blaster, which has forced the 3.5mm headphone jack down to the bottom. Not an ideal location but the One (M8) gains points back for the IR port letting you remotely control TV sets and other home appliances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has the 3.5mm audio jack at the top, in what's a clearly more minimal approach to the bottom and top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the HTC One (M8) features the differently sized lenses of the Dual Camera setup along with a Dual LED two-tone flash. The latter has a natural yellow and an amber LED while the camera is comprised of a 4 MP primary lens and a secondary unit allowing measures distance and depth effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 only has one of each, lens and flash, but 5 time the resolution. On the other hand, the HTC One (M8) has the Ultra pixel size in its favor. More on that, in the camera chapter later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can safely disregard any differences between the HTC One (M8) and Sony Xperia Z2 relating to size and weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will make the experience of holding the smartphone different is the shape and materials used. The HTC One (M8) is curved and kinda sticks to the hand. The angular Sony Xperia Z2 is perhaps a tad more aggressive but less comfortable to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's just a little sharp on the hand but not in a terribly bad way. In fact, the HTC One is more slippery perhaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd say to each its own - both smartphones are built to a really high standard but feel sufficiently different. You won't make a mistake picking either one up. And we suggest you do just that - hit your local retail store and handle both to see how you like them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In more objective terms than pure aesthetics, the HTC One (M8) has the better pair of stereo speakers and an IR blaster. A proper shutter key and water-proofing are Sony's key advantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) and Sony Xperia Z2 have top of the line displays, not counting those few rocking QHD resolutions out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones rock 1920 x 1080 resolutions on different diagonals. The HTC One (M8) has a 5" Super LCD3 unit with a pixel density of 441 ppi. The Sony Xperia Z2 has an X-Reality-driven Triluminos LCD of 5.2" diagonal which produces 424 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two LCD panels use the standard RGB pixel arrangement - meaning three subpixels (red, green and blue) per pixel. As you can see the matrices of the two smartphones barely differ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual performance of the displays is also very similar. The black levels of the Sony Xperia Z2 are deeper than those of the HTC One (M8) but only just - you'll not notice a difference even comparing them side by side. The brightness and contrast tests show a lead for the HTC One (M8) but, again, the gap isn't particularly wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the outdoor visibility test reveals how the display maintains its contrast in bright sunlight. Here the HTC One (M8) is again superior, but only just.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The colors and viewing angles are a little better on the HTC smartphone as well. But keep in mind that the Sony Xperia Z2 doesn't lag behind too much and has a top quality display by any standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). The slightly superior contrast and sunlight legibility secure this round for the One (M8). Only just though - the Sony Xperia Z2 display is excellent too, and for purposes practical you won't notice too many differences between these two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has a big lead when it comes to battery capacity - it has a juice pack 600 mAh larger than its competitor. The HTC One (M8) comes with a 2,600 mAh unit whereas the Sony Xperia Z2 dominates with 3,200 mAh on tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let's look at the tests and see what's what. Call times for both are outstanding at above 20 hours each. The Sony Xperia Z2 has two hours more on its charge though at this point the scores are almost as good as equal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing shows two great results. The Sony Xperia Z2 lasted almost 2 and a half hours longer though, taking this round with ease.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And finally the video playback test. Another great result for the HTC One (M8) but again not enough to match the Sony Xperia Z2. This time the Sony smartphone bested its competitor by only an hour.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Adding-in the stand by times of the two smartphones and we the final scores. The Sony Xperia Z2 gets an endurance rating of 89 hours - among the top in our list of tested devices. The HTC One (M8) got 71 hours - an impressive score in its own right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. The HTC One (M8) put up an excellent performance, but it simply couldn't match the Sony Xperia Z2 and its huge 3,200 mAh battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interfaces<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's a story as old as the platform itself - we have two handsets powered by Android but looking nothing like each other. Both the HTC One (M8) and the Sony Xperia Z2 run on Android 4.4.2 KitKat but while the first comes with the Sense 6 launcher, the second one uses the latest Xperia UI, resulting in a rather different user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you an idea we have short videos showing both in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense 6 lockscreen has the usual functionality - there's a clock, weather info, lockscreen widgets and four shortcut slots that mirror the four docked apps you have on the homescreen. The unlock button gives you three options - a swipe up for the last opened app, swipe to the left for the homescreen and a swipe to the right to BlinkFeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a cool bonus you can unlock the One (M8) without the assistance of the power button. A double tap will show you the lockscreen, a swipe up will unlock the device, a swipe down will prompt voice call and finally you get swipe left for the homescreen and a swipe right for BlinkFeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can always access Google Now by swiping from the bottom up on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony lockscreen also supports widgets (one per pane), but there is only one shortcut at the bottom - to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now is accessible in the same way as on the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen of the HTC One (M8) offers five shortcuts in the dock - the app drawer and four apps or folders. You get a standard grid of apps and widgets and a total of five maximum homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Personalization menu allows you to change the theme of the UI and it even changes the accent colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the One (M8) is once again reserved for HTC BlinkFeed. It aggregates content from your social networks, as well as from over a thousand news sources. You can pick what topics you're interested in and BlinkFeed will automatically pull relevant content. You can also search for specific content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2's homescreen also offers four docked apps along with an app drawer shortcut. Sony gives you two extra homescreens though for a total of 7. You can also add themes to the Xperia UI which will change the accent colors and the overall look. Themes are downloadable as well and there are many third-party ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's notification area closely resembles the stock Android one. You get two panes - the one with notifications and another one to hold Quick Toggles. You can access Quick Toggles via a two-finger swipe and the toggles are changeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony notification area is pretty much identical with the HTC and stock Android one. You get customizable Quick Toggles in a separate tab that's accessible via a two-finger swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8)'s app drawer isn't horizontally scrolled but vertically. You can customize the grid by either 3 x 4 or 4 x 5. Sorting is done either alphabetically or chronologically or you can choose to have custom sorting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia Z2 app drawer can be sorted alphabetically, manually (read custom), by most used or recently installed. The leftmost pane is reserved for a swipe-out menu that offers the sorting options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hitting the recent apps button on the HTC One (M8) shows thumbnails of all recently opened apps. You swipe them upward to dismiss or select them to go to that app. Luckily HTC now has a kill all button at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 uses the stock Android task switcher interface and allows you to scroll through recent apps thumbnails and swipe them to either side to close them. A point in the Xperia Z2 favor are the so-called Small Apps - they are pop-up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen. Those are Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Touch Lock. More are downloadable through the Google Play store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's What's New app can be accessed similarly to Google Now - via a swipe up from the virtual home button and sits right next to Google Now's shortcut. This app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today, but it isn't limited to the Play Store only. It'll display content from Sony's PlayStation store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While two very different ways of operating your smartphone both Sense 6 and Xperia UI offer the functionality you'd expect and need from any smartphone. In the end Android has grown very complicated under the hood and pretty simple on the surface of it. Both UIs follow KitKat's ground rules and the result will leave none wishing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense 6 and Xperia UI are buttery smooth thanks to Google's behind the scenes work and the tip-top Snapdragon hardware orchestrating the scene on both smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Everyone is supposed to break this one as they prefer - picking between the two well-polished launchers is strictly a matter of personal preference. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 and HTC One (M8) have identical Qualcomm MSM8974AB Snapdragon 801 chipsets with quad-core Krait 400 processors clocked at 2.3 GHz and Adreno 330 GPUs but the two differ in the RAM department. The HTC One (M8) offers just 2 GB of RAM whereas the Sony Xperia Z2 adds one more for a full 3 GB. In theory that should give the Sony smartphone an edge in multitasking although it's not necessarily going to be reflected in benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's check out the tests. First off we have GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 4. GeekBench 3 is a processor and memory cross-platform benchmark while AnTuTu 4 2D and 3D graphics testing for an all-round score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 shows a significant lead for the Sony Xperia Z2 while AnTuTu 4 favors the HTC One (M8) by a large margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round test, judging CPU, System and Memory performance as well as graphics and web performance. We give you the overall result as well as both the single and multi-core result. Overall score goes to the HTC One (M8) and so does the single-core test. The Sony Xperia Z2 proved a little faster in the multi-core test. Differences are rather minor in all cases, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now for graphic benchmarks. Here we've opted for GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan tests and will show you both the onscreen and offscreen tests, which should be very identical considering that both run at 1080p, which is also the native screen resolution of both devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the two contenders split the results - the HTC One (M8) takes 2.7 T-Rex by 1-2 fps respectively while the Sony Xperia Z2 comes on top in the heavier 3.0 Manhattan test by 0.3-0.6 fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally we have BrowserMark 2.1 and Kraken 1.1 - both web-based benchmarks. BrowserMark tests HTML 5 performance while Mozilla's Kraken looks at JavaScript performance. The Sony Xperia Z2 claims both benchmarks by a wide margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So overall the two smartphones are as close as it gets when it comes to performance. Trading victories in each type of benchmark means that you can expect equally great performance from these two in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Hardly surprising when you consider that the two smartphones are powered by the same chipset. The Sony Xperia Z2 does have an extra GB of RAM, but that's more about future-proofing than benefitting the user experience right now. </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC's gallery organizes images in albums which are ordered by date or folder. You can also sort them by location. Once you open an album, the first and biggest thumbnail is reserved for slideshows. Once you tap it you can customize if you want an effect added over the photos and what sort of music you would like to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's gallery can connect to a number of online sources like Facebook, Google+ and Dropbox and mold your online galleries into your local ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's gallery, dubbed Album, and sorts pictures by date. You have a side-swipeable menu that lists all of your folders. You can pinch in and out in the photo stacks to change the thumbnail size. As with HTC's gallery, Sony's Album can display Facebook, Picasa, Flickr albums inside the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. While Album looks better and has more eye candy, HTC's gallery has a great slideshow function that makes up for that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC's music player is pretty simple. It sorts music by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders and can stream music through DLNA. The player will automatically scour the internet to find missing album art and even lyrics for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly there's no equalizer on board the HTC One (M8)'s stock music player so you'd either need to change the player or live with the built-in settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's music player is called Walkman. Not only does it store and show your local music but features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs. Music Unlimited includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on a hidden swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by the usual options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a cool Infinite button that helps you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Using Gracenote Walkman will automatically download music information and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony doesn't leave its listeners without options. ClearAudio+ determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Surround sound mode imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones offer FM Radios with RDS. They can scan for local stations and store them as favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. Audiophiles will appreciate Sony's dedication to bring the most customizability to music as possible. HTC's passive approach earns it the boot here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC's video player is again pretty simple and doesn't even have a dedicated app, instead it resides within the gallery. You get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to capture images from the video, volume slider, and sharing options. All hide automatically after a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) managed to play 3GP, 3G2, MP4, WMV, Xvid, DivX and AVI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Movies app has a great UI. It's connected to Gracenote and shows you additional information about your videos - metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support seemed lacking on the Sony Xperia Z2 - it managed to play Xvid, MP4 and MKV videos, leaving out a few popular codecs unattended.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). The One (M8) may lose out on looks but performs better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 does produce pretty great audio output and its performance is enough to please even relatively demanding users, but the HTC One (M8) really is in a class of its own here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC flagship is the loudest smartphone we've seen in a while and it has excellently clean output both with and without a pair of headphones - in the first case it's actually notably better than what the Xperia Z2 manages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One (M8) frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). The louder and cleaner output of the HTC flagship make this one of the easiest categories to judge so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both devices offer front-facing stereo speakers to ensure not only quality stereo sound but also avoid sideways or back-blasting audio. However neither seems really impressive when it comes to volume, despite the HTC One (M8) having those fabled individual amplifiers for each speaker and the company boasting 20% louder output compared to the previous One. HTC has BoomSound while Sony offers xLOUD which is supposed to improve speaker loudness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the scores. While they are almost identical the HTC does have a slightly deeper-sounding duo of speakers. That's only just mind you and you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference unless you put the two side to side. The Sony Xperia Z2 does feature more compact speakers that don't require as much space and they are water-resistant, which is impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera features and hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So let's look at the hardware before and software on paper before we begin analyzing the results. We're dealing with two very different approaches to mobile photography and it shows from the megapixel count, the software that's provided, the sensor and pixel size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) comes with a modest-sounding 4 MP camera with a 1/3.0" sensor with a maximum resolution of 2688 x 1520 in 16:9 aspect - meaning wider images in comparison to the 4:3 ratio. Each pixel sits at 2 µm which is pretty big for a smartphone. The aperture is an f/2.0 so it should allow for more light to reach the sensor. The field of view is relatively wide at 28 mm. Unlike its predecessor, the HTC One (M8) doesn't offer optical image stabilization. It does have a 5 MP front-facing camera, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the latest generation ImageChip 2, the HTC One (M8) allows for digital image stabilization, and makes sure you get sharper images with less noise and better overall quality. The One (M8) also has a new autofocus system, allowing for faster than ever performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's that redesigned dual LED, dubbed Smart Flash. It utilizes two LEDs in different colors (a warm and a cool one). The camera system can analyze the available scene light and by mixing and matching the temperature (the color of light) of the combined light output by the two LEDs, it produces more natural illumination for your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But what's more interesting is the secondary camera lens, above the main one. It's a sort of a rangefinder. Its job is to create a depth map of your scene, which enables cool effects such as background blur (faux bokeh) or refocus your images after the shot. It can even allow for 3D-like photos with an extra layer of depth, which is visible when you tilt the phone (a parallax view). The Xperia Z2 offer similar effects but it takes a few shots with its single camera to achieve it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC camera app is unified and let's you choose Still camera, Video, Zoe camera, Selfie, Dual Capture (front and back camera simultaneously) and 360-degree Panorama, which allows both portrait and landscape oriented shooting. The Zoe Camera shooting mode records the necessary video and images to create the beautiful animated photo reels that you will find in the dedicated Zoe app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the settings you can adjust the usual functions such as exposure compensation, the ISO, white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second lens allows for cool shooting modes like UFocus, where the background to your subject is artificially blurred to create bokeh (out of focus area), Foregrounder, which creates a sort of motion blur around your subject, Colorize, which aims to accentuate one color in the frame, Seasons creates faux season effects such as snowflakes. The best one by far is Stereoscopic - it allows you to view 3D-like images on the screen of the phone by moving it and is really cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A clever new accelerometer-based trick allows you to start the camera even while the phone is locked in standby. With the screen off and the phone in landscape orientation, pressing one of the volume key activates the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 comes with a 1/2.3" sensor with a maximum usable resolution of 20.7 MP in 4:3 aspect. However most of the time you'll be shooting stills at 8 MP in either 16:9 or 4:3 aspect anyway. Depending on the shooting mode you'll either get 5248x3936 pixel resolution images (20.7 MP) or 3840 x 2160 ones (in 8 MP). Pixels are much smaller at 1.1µm each. The aperture is f/2.0 as the HTC while the Sony G lens is a little wider at 27 mm. There's no optical image stabilization here either. The front-facing camera on the Sony Xperia Z2 is a 2.2 MP unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a physical shutter button on the Sony Xperia Z2, which cameraphone enthusiasts will find refreshing. There's also digital image stabilization in the form of Steady Shot, although that hardly counts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia Z2 features two camera interfaces. The default one is Superior Auto mode. It automatically chooses one of the many shooting modes tuning every aspect of the image quality. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode. Superior Auto locks your resolution at 8 MP in 16:9 aspect and you can't do full-res 20.7 MP shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other shooting modes like Background Defocus, which does essentially what UFocus does just without the fancy hardware - it's all software driven.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual mode lets you control the settings of the camera down to resolution and aspect. Here's where you can find HDR shooting (which strangely isn't offered as a different shooting mode). Here's where you can also use 20.7 MP mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But manual mode is a bit disappointing as well. There's an exposure compensation slider, a white balance selector, and also ISO, metering and some focus modes appear buried in the settings menu. And that's all - with a name like that we were hoping for some manual focus, or at least a way to tune contrast, saturation, sharpness and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 also offers Sweep Panorama mode - it allows you to take multiple images in a sweeping motion and then have a panorama made in-phone. You can shoot either in portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift burst is a cool mode - upon choosing it the phone will snap a burst of images before you even hit the shutter. That way you might not miss an important moment. AR effect mode (Augmented Reality) enriches the scene with virtual characters, effects and props such as mountains or forests. Sadly the mode limits your photos to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video modes on the HTC One (M8) are almost unchanged since its predecessor. The camcorder maxes out at 1080p@30fps shooting but there's also 1080p@60fps, up from last year's 720p@60fps mode on the HTC One (M7). Slow motion video capture is recorded in 120 fps at 720p - you can edit slow motion movies to show only portions of the clip in slow-mo, like on the iPhone 5s, which is cool. There's also HDR video at 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 matches the HTC One (M8) toe to toe with the 1080p@30/60 fps along with Timeshift Video which records 720p@120 fps and then allows you to edit the video to play only a portion in slow-mo. But the Sony Xperia Z2 does add 2160p (UHD) video at 30 fps. This video mode is essentially twice the resolution of the HTC One (M8)'s back-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up this is what we've noticed as far as advantages go. In the next chapter we'll be looking at the actual samples from both cameras and camcorders so this is only the preliminary outlook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One (M8) over the Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z2 over the HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. The HTC One (M8) does have more features for its still camera, but the Sony Xperia Z2 clearly has the superior hardware - larger sensor of higher resolution and with 4K video recording to boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since we're dealing with two very different sensors here we're going to show you a few 100% crops and compare them. We have a full set of full resolution images waiting as well and we've taken them on the HTC One (M8) at the maximum 4 MP resolution as well as 8 MP in Superior Auto and 20.7 MP in Manual mode from the Sony Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First we upsized the HTC One (M8) 4 MP samples to 8 MP and 20.7 MP as that would allow us to compare the resolved detail to those of the Xperia Z2. Downsizing the Xperia Z2 samples would have been unfair as it would have resulted in loss of detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also included a couple of crops showing the detail from both phones at their natural resolution - 4 MP vs 8 MP and 20.7 MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good light</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'd expect to see the best of both performers in good light where the sensor can gulp up as much detail as possible. The Sony Xperia Z2 does a fine job of detailing the scene and doesn't struggle with small, low-contrast objects like the fence or the edges of the walls. It even manages to show the wall texture. The HTC One (M8) is a different story - it can't even come closer to the amount of detail its rival resolves. The processing isn't quite ideal on either contender - there are obvious traces of oversharpening on the (M8), while the Xperia Z2 suffers from overly aggressive noise reduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When shooting objects that are further away, such as landscape or cityscape, the HTC One (M8)'s lower resolution becomes a bigger liability as there are simply not enough pixels to describe the different objects. The Sony cameraphone manages to pull out much more detail and everything looks crisper and sharper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color balance is another area where the Xperia Z2 seems to have an advantage - while neither phone is spot on, we find its warmer colors better than the colder ones on the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now the crops from the native resolutions. As you can see the HTC One (M8) can barely match the Sony Xperia Z2 at per-pixel level - hardly ideal when you have 2 times fewer pixels as is the case when you use the Superior Auto mode on the Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we view the 20.7 MP vs the 4 MP samples, the difference in total resolved detail is even more dramatic, even if the Sony Xperia Z2 no longer leads in the per-pixel battle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual if you want to do some extensive pixel peeping yourselves we've secured the full resolution shots. As follows those are of the Sony Xperia Z2 in Superior Auto mode at 8 MP in 16:9, the 4 MP 16:9 HTC One (M8) ones and finally full resolution Sony Xperia Z2 20.7 MP Manual mode images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes out photo quality comparison tool if you want to check out resolution, sharpness, noise and color performance under lab conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2 vs the HTC One (M8) in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. The larger pixels of the HTC One (M8) camera should give it an edge in low-light conditions (though we are yet to see if they will be able to make up for the smaller sensor), but the low-res camera simply can't compete when the lighting conditions are good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low-light</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to low light, we've prepped a comparison between the HTC One (M8) and Sony Xperia Z2 with and without their flashes enabled. We've tested the One (M8) at its native resolution at 4 MP compared to the Xperia Z2 at both 8 MP and 20.7 MP resolutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the bigger pixels of the HTC One (M8) should play a huge role of allowing more light in. The two cameras do produce equally exposed images, but they have a different approach towards achieving it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Sony Xperia Z2 chose to up the ISO to 400 and give a 1/32s shutter speed, the HTC smartphone took images at a maximum of 200 ISO going for a shutter speed of 1/17s. This means that the One (M8) should produce cleaner images with less noise, but at least half of those are expected to have hand-shake induced blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the pictures we see the larger pixels and the lower ISO helping the HTC One (M8) actually produce a cleaner image, but one with slightly less detail than on the Sony Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the Sony Xperia Z2's 20.7 MP images reveals that there's hardly anything to be gained by switching to that mode - it doesn't bring extra detail over the 8MP Superior Auto and it certainly results in noisier images as it doesn't have the benefit of oversampling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither smartphone has impressively-powerful flash. We'd say the two are about even despite the HTC One (M8) having an extra LED to throw into the action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again here are the full resolution images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. We do prefer the Sony Xperia Z2 approach of going for faster shooting speeds, but the HTC One (M8) does produce less noisy images, which are only slightly behind in terms of detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Misc</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this chapter we'll be looking at HDR and defocus images. HDR stands for high dynamic range and is done by snapping a couple of images with different exposures and then combining them for an image with equally-well exposed scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones have different approaches to HDR with the one chosen by the HTC One (M8) particularly puzzling. The phone goes for a slightly over-exaggerated effect boosting the shadows to the point where the image starts to appear very unrealistic. Worse still, it actually pushes the highlights higher, which means that you lose more detail there than in the regular non-HDR shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enabling the mode does produce some rather interesting images on occasion, but we'd suggest you keep it off whenever the image quality is crucial to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 goes for a far more moderate application of the effect, bringing back some lost detail in both the highlights and the shadows without going overboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll also take a look at HTC's UFocus and Sony's Background Defocus effects. Both modes will create a faux bokeh (out of focus, blurred, area) behind the subject of the image. Sony's flagship relies on a few photos it captures in a quick sequence, while the HTC flagship has the second depth-analyzing sensor, which should give it an edge in calculation at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we weren't very impressed with the performance of either phone as they both have plenty of problems separating the subject from the background. It's more visible on the HTC shot as the blur applied is more intensive and so the defects are more visible, but the Xperia Z2 is not doing too hot either. It turns out that the second camera gamble didn't pay off for HTC as it can't even provide an advantage in the one mode it was designed for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the full resolution samples for your viewing pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. The Xperia Z2 has the better HDR, while the second camera didn't really help the One (M8) win the background defocus competition.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Judging by its specs, the Sony Xperia Z2 is the clear favorite when it comes to video recording. The smartphone can do UHD videos (3840 x 2160 pixels), which adds up to 8 MP or twice the resolution of the HTC One (M8)'s main camera resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot two FullHD videos at 30 and 60 fps and took 100% resolution crops from those to put them side by side and see the difference in quality. The Sony Xperia Z2 shoots both modes at the same field of view while the HTC One (M8) looks to have a slightly zoomed-in 1080p@60fps mode compared to the 1080p@30fps mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Detail-wise the HTC One (M8)'s videos have higher detail in the 30 fps mode but lower in the 60 fps. If you're shooting in 1080p@30 fps, which is the most common way currently the HTC One (M8) is a tad better performer. You'll note that the 60 fps FullHD video captured with the Sony Xperia Z2 looks to be better-detailed than the 30 fps one but still not as good as the One (M8) sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However adding the UHD video sample clearly points to a vastly-superior Sony Xperia Z2. The resolved detail is far higher than on any of the other clips - great result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) captures FullHD videos at 30 fps with a bitrate of 19 Mbps with around 28 frames per second. Audio bitrate sits high at 190 Kbps with stereo channels and 48 kHz sampling rate. FullHD videos at 60 fps have a framerate of around 59 fps and a slightly higher bitrate of 20 Mbps. Audio is recorded at 193 Kbps with the same sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2's 1080p@30 fps video has a lower bitrate in comparison - 17 Mbps. Framerate is a tad higher at 29 fps but audio has a lower bitrate of 154 Kbps. This results in superior audio recording abilities of the HTC One (M8). The Sony Xperia Z2 is again stereo-capable with the same sampling rate of 48 kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, 1080p@60 fps videos of the Xperia Z2 have much higher bitrate compared to the 1080p@30 fps videos and both the 1080p videos of the HTC One (M8) - 30 Mbps. Framerate was a constant 59 fps but audio sampling rate left something to be desired at 157 Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultra High Definition videos (2160p@30 fps) are the cream of the crop. They offer 29 fps constantly, an audio bitrate of 154 Kbps and an impressive 54 Mbps bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the HTC One (M8)'s 30 fps and 60 fps videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Sony Xperia Z2's 2160p, 1080p@30 fps and 1080p@60 fps videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our video comparison tool. Here you can check out the low light performance of both smartphones. In terms of serving better detail when the lights go dim the HTC One (M8) is a little better at 1080p but can't match Sony's 2160p Sony Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Xperia Z2 vs the HTC One (M8) in our Video Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. The HTC One (M8) offers great 1080p videos, beating the Sony Xperia Z2 by a bit in terms of image quality and notably when it comes to audio. However, throw in the 2160p UHD recording and the Xperia Z2 raises to a new level, one which the One (M8) has no answer for. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking back at what just happened, it did feel more like a gentleman's duel than a brutal cage fight. Great-looking and well-behaved. Too well-behaved perhaps for an exciting and engaging matchup? We don't know about that but these two are definitely not the kind to walk away when the going gets rough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a certain kind that wouldn't let themselves be dragged into a fist fight but will do more than just duck when the punches start flying. Regardless if outweighed and outnumbered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yep, there're better spec'd flagships out there, longer spec sheets and bigger box-office numbers. But although the sales are the ultimate decider, a product's game-changing abilities are hard to quantify. Sony pioneered water resistance in the high-end and the likes of Samsung decided to take the plunge as well. Coincidence - we think not. The HTC One, on the other hand, has been Android's first line of defense against Apple fans taking the mickey out of the platform's plastic flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This was a battle of similar design philosophies that haven't resulted in nearly identical look and feel, quite the opposite. Each maker had their own take on build and looks, giving us two of the hottest pieces of Android hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In truth, the Sony Xperia Z2 entered the contest better prepared - it has more RAM, the better still image quality and higher-res videos, the water resistance and dust protection, the better battery backup. It's the specs-junkie's choice in this pair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) has the better screen and audio quality. The dual camera setup allowing depth-of-field effects and Zoe will be well appreciated if pixel-peeping isn't necessarily your game. The IR blaster and a high-res front cam score some points too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the HTC One (M8) is losing the fight on the spec sheet but isn't lagging too far behind on things that should matter to most. The chipset is just as snappy, the Sense-d Android UI is feature-rich and tasteful and the battery life is good enough. And don't think that the display is worse because it's smaller - 0.2 inches less of screen diagonal are easily offset by better contrast, viewing angles, reflectivity and brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, there's a reason why Sony's been doing so well lately. The Japanese are looking extra solid in the midrange - and that's admittedly an HTC weak point. With that kind of backup from the ranks, Sony's new 6-month release cycle doesn't look like a gamble. Theirs is the standard-setting mini version of a flagship too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, that's a good few things HTC can learn. But with the HTC One (M8), it is still perfectly able to prove that building a proper flagship isn't one of them.</paragraph>
