			<subsectionTitle>Intel Android smartphone reference design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After several prototype devices that never saw the light of day, Intel has finally pulled it off - one of their processors is powering a real-world smartphone. And there will be more to come too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were two Android smartphones with an Atom CPU ticking inside them - Intel's reference platform and the Lenovo K800, which is headed for a Q2 launch in China.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the reference platform. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z2460 "Medfield" processor with a single core (which is HyperThreading-enabled) paired with an overclocked PowerVR SGX540 GPU (running at 400MHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Early benchmarks show very competitive performance and power usage, compared to current dual-core ARM chips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of hardware, the reference platform packs a 4" screen with the unconventional 1024x600 pixels resolution, 8MP main camera with 1080p video recording, 1.3MP video-call camera and 16GB built-in storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's running stock Android 2.3 Gingerbread, but Android Ice Cream Sandwich is coming to Intel's platform too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It looks and feels like a modern smartphone, you wouldn?t guess that it's a completely different platform underneath. Anyway, it's not a device that will make it to market - it's just a showcase of what Intel's platform is capable of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news for Intel is that Motorola has agreed to build phones and tablets using the Atom Medfield platform. There isn't even a clue when they might hit the shelves though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo K800 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The device that will make it to market is the Lenovo K800. It uses the same internals as the reference platform, but ups the screen size to 4.5" and the resolution to 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the K800 is an 8MP unit capable of 1080p video recording. There's 16GB built-in storage, but there's no microSD card to expand it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the reference platform, the Lenovo K800 is running skinned Android 2.3. Lenovo say that the phone will be updated to 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich some time after the release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn?t spend much time playing with the phone but things seemed to be running smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K800 isn't the thinnest phone around, but its 10mm of thickness are very respectable for a first time effort. It features an industrial design reminiscent of Lenovo's ThinkPad line. There's a 1900mAh battery inside, but we don't have info on the standby and talk time numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One curious features that the Lenovo K800 has (that no other smartphone has yet) is Wi-Di - something like a wireless HDMI. Intel and major TV makers are pushing forward with this technology, which is easier to hook up than micro/mini HDMI ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has WCDMA 3G connectivity with HSPA+ (up to 21Mbps downlink) for China Unicom's network and will launch in Q2 of this year. We haven?t heard of any plans to bring the phone to market outside China for now, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Spectrum hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG brought their latest super droid for Verizon to CES under the name Spectrum, a version of the South Korean Optimus LTE and the LG Nitro HD for AT&amp;T. That means the Spectrum packs a 4.5" AH-IPS LCD display of 720p resolution, a dual-core 1.5GHz processor and LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design-wise, the LG Spectrum is nearly identical to Optimus LTE LU6200, whereas AT&amp;T's version takes after Optimus LTE SU640. We noticed that the back has changed though - it's now glossy and gets smudged all over with fingerprints very quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the important bits are all unchanged - the high-quality, high-resolution display is one of the best on the market (or soon to be on the market), the Qualcomm MSM8660 Snapdragon chipset (1.5GHz dual-core Scorpion processor, Adreno 220 GPU and 1GB of RAM), 8MP camera with 1080p video and, of course, the LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port on top of the LG Spectrum is an MHL-enabled port, so you can hook up the phone to an HDTV. There's 4GB of built-in storage and a preinstalled 16GB microSD card, so there's plenty of room for videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out the LTE connectivity very quickly and our site loaded very fast. Unfortunately, we didn?t have enough time with the LG Spectrum to run a proper speed test and see how it handles on Verizon's 4G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast LTE connection enables painless video streaming. The Spectrum comes preloaded with Netflix HD and ESPN apps that give you access to movies and sports on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We went back for more shots that offer a better look at the device. Check out the carbon fiberish look of the back - sadly, the glossy finish of it has a heavy case of "fingerprint magnet". We're also not big fans of the capacitive home button (what can we say, we like hardware keys).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also spend a little more time with the browser. Text is rendered beautifully on the screen thanks to the 326ppi pixel density. Viewing angles are great - among the best we've seen on LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To see how the Snapdragon chipset fares, we tried out a quick game and it ran smoothly. By the way, the videos looked great, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, check out the car and desk modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also had a snazzy accessory for the Spectrum - the Smart Pouch. They are available in several styles and offer protection for the device, but with a twist - there's a window at the center, which displays a clock face (6 different faces are available) and will also show any notifications. The phone will automatically detect the pouch too, you don't have to activate this functionality manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Toshibas has a few interesting gadgets to show at the CES as well. We managed to get our hands on the company's latest tablets and smartphones. While the Honeycomb slates were rather unexciting, the two smartphones caught our attention for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Mango powered IS12T and the Android-based Arrows Z. There is one super power shared by both handsets - they are waterproof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Toshiba IS12T comes with IPX5 certification for splash resistance. It is based on the typical for the latest Windows Phone smartphones platform - MSM8655 Snapdragon (1GHz single core Scorpion, Adreno 205 GPU) and utilizes a 3.7-inch WVGA TFT display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one notable feature that separates this fella from most of the Windows gang - its 13.2 megapixel camera and the complimentary 32GB internal storage. The IS12T is running on the latest Windows Phone 7.5 Mango OS and is available for quite some time, but is a Japan-exclusive smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other phone swimming in the water is the Toshiba Arrows Z - another 13.2 megapixel cameraphone with 1080p video recording. This one though has a 1.2GHz dual-ore processor ticking inside and a huge 4.3-inch 720p display to experience the Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS. Unfortunately it is another Japan-exclusive phone, so you'll probably never see it again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now about those slates we mentioned. The Excite AT200 and the Thrive 7 have been announced in September 2011, but they've been launched just recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excite AT200 is based on the TI OMAP-4430 chipset with a 1.2GHz dual-core processor, PowerVR SGX540 GPU and 1GB RAM. It has a 10.1" LED-backlit display, a 5 megapixel camera and runs on the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Toshiba advertise the Excite as the thinnest tablet in the world and so far it is. The Excite is just 7.7mm thick, a 0.2mm less than the Samsung's Galaxy Tab 7.7. See for yourself in the live photos below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other slate is the Thrive 7, which is based on the older NVIDIA Tegra2 and is running on Android 3.2 Honeycomb. It's not the thinnest around, but it should be cheap enough and will offer solid features. Toshiba is also offering as separate accessories a nice small dock and a wireless keyboard for the Thrive 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you followed the CES events closely, you'll remember Toshiba showcased three mysterious tablets without saying much about their specs. Well, here we have a few shots of the 5.1" and 7.7" ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7.7" one uses an AMOLED and is all metal. Its build quality is really impressive too. Unfortunately that's everything we know so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.1" tablet specs info is equally scarce - it uses a really wide 21:9 display and has a metallic back too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We suspect both upcoming slates are based on dual-core chipsets and run on Android, but we still have to wait for official confirmation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Droid 4 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Verizon and Motorola had some interesting Androids to show at CES, including a brand new member of the Droid family. It's not as thin as its RAZR siblings, but 12.9mm still sounds great given the arsenal of features it offers (4" qHD screen, slide-out QWERTY and LTE are the headliners).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Droid 4 measures 126.7 x 69.9 x 12.9 mm and weighs 179 grams. If you've just handled the Motorola RAZR (like we did) it feels a little chunky, but it's fairly compact for its class. It's heavier than the Droid 3 though (167g) and while it's not the heaviest phone, we were hoping it would be lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Droid 4 packs a really fancy slide-out QWERTY keyboard - the edge-lit, laser-cut keys provide a very good typing experience and the backlight is very even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD screen on the Droid 4 measures 4" in diagonal and boasts a qHD resolution. The display is protected by scratch-resistant glass. We'd really like to get a better chance to examine the screen to make sure it doesn?t use a PenTile matrix as Moto has used before on its 4" qHD screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, sliding the screen and keyboard apart isn't the most comfortable experience as there's no spring-assistance mechanism to smooth things out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Motorola Droid 4 felt rather ordinary but that's probably because we got spoiled with the Kevlar-coated back of the RAZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside is a 1785mAh battery that is good for 12 hours and a half of continuous talk time and about 8 and a half days of standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola have added a couple of protective layers on the Droid 4 - a hardware one (special water-repellant coating) and a software one, called Business Ready. Business Ready offers government-grade encryption for your contacts, emails and calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Verizon is touting 5-12Mbps downlink and 2-5Mbps uplink speeds through their LTE network when using the Motorola Droid 4, but we didn?t get a chance to test that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Droid 4 will be launching soon but there's no pricing yet. It will use Android 2.3.5 at launch, but the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update is on the way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola RAZR MAXX and purple RAZR hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola had a couple of other interesting handsets for Verizon - the RAZR MAXX and the purple version of the original RAZR. The MAXX is the one that had our jaws drop to the floor though, it's a little thicker and a little heavier than a regular RAZR but it offers the amazing 21.5 hours of continuous talk time. Now go back and read that again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key to this nearly day-long talk time (people with insomnia will probably appreciate it) the giant battery that Motorola somehow managed to cram inside. We are talking a capacity of 3300mAh here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's almost the size of a 7" tablet battery. Big (in capacity) batteries are usually big (in physical size), but we put the MAXX next to one of the thinnest smartphones ever, its RAZR XT912 half-twin, and saw only minor physical changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a micron under 9mm the Motorola RAZR MAXX is still slimmer than an iPhone 4S and its battery has more than twice the capacity. The MAXX weighs more than a regular RAZR, thouhg (145g vs. 127g).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything else about the Motorola RAZR MAXX is virtually identical to the regular RAZR for Verizon - that means 4.3" qHD SuperAMOLED screen with scratch resistant glass, 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, 1GB of RAM and LTE connectivity. We're happy to report that the Kevlar-coated back is still onboard too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX will be available soon for $299 on a two-year contract with Verizon and it will come with 32GB storage (16GB built-in + 16GB microSD). It will launch with Android 2.3.5 but 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich will be made available later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third phone of the Verizon Droid roster is the purple version of the Motorola RAZR XT912, which will be available soon for $199 with a two-year contract with Verizon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The purple is more of a highlight - the glass bezel all around the screen is still black, it's just the plastic around the edge that's purple. On the back, the grey/black Kevlar surface dominates and the glass that houses the camera, flash and loudspeaker is black too. We suppose Motorola couldn?t have painted the Kevlar, but it would have been nice if they colored the black glass at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Specs-wise there are no differences between the purple and black models of the Motorola RAZR for Verizon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola MOTOACTV hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We do a hands-on with this or that, but here's a droid you can actually put on your hand - the Motorola MOTOACTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a tiny (46 x 46 x 9.6 mm) device that runs a full Android OS and is intended to be your training watch/fitness tracker of choice. It weighs just 35g and when you attach it to the wrist strap, it really feels quite comfortable (there are other ways to wear it, an arm band for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's rain resistant and sweat-proof, so you don't have to worry about that. There's Gorilla glass on top of the 1.6" touchscreen (176x220) too, for extra protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a built-in GPS receiver to track your run and custom software to keep track of your exercises. It will also play music for up to 20 hours from its 8GB built-in storage (a 16GB option is available too). A 3.5mm audio jack can be used to plug in any pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned that the MOTOACTV runs Android and it does - but there's a custom skin on top to make it usable with the small screen, especially while exercising. There are a couple of big hardware buttons too, so you're not relying solely on the touchscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Kodak Polaroid SC1630 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our tour around the CES 2012 booth continued with Kodak and their Android-running smartphone Polaroid SC1630. The 16 megapixel device is one of the very few phones to offer optical zoom, which lets it easily stand out in the crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in the days, when this one was going by as Altek Leo it hardly turned into a great success, but now it has an even higher resolution camera - 16MP - and some of Kodak's image processing magic, so it should have better chances on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out how the Kodak Polaroid SC1630 looks in real life:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaroid SC1630 really starts turning heads when its lens extend - they offer up to 3x optical zoom. Other camera specs that Kodak shared are F3.1-F5.6 aperture, ISO up to 3200 and shutter speeds of up to 1/1400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a look at the camera interface too:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the Polaroid SC1630, Kodak had a very compact printer at their booth that allowed the printing of images directly from the smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Razer Project Fiona hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Razer are best known for their PC gaming accessories, but recently they're making a push into gaming devices (like the Blade laptop), too. Project Fiona is a really interesting device - it's a 10.1" Windows 8 tablet with gaming controllers bolted to its sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controllers look quite similar to the the PlayStation Move (besides the glowing ball on top, of course). Each of the controllers has a joystick with four buttons on it and two shoulder buttons. The device includes force feedback, 3-axis gyro, magnetometer and an accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Between these controllers is a large 10.1-inch, 1280 x 800 resolution multi-touch display. Along with that you also get Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0 and Dolby 7.1 surround sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Powering all of this is Intel?s Core i7 processor (an unknown Ivy Bridge model). Razer withheld info on the GPU. The tablet runs Windows 8 with custom Razer software that allows you to map controls, so regular PC games can run out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, devs can choose to support the additional goodies that come with Project Fiona - the accelerometers, the touchscreen and so on can add a whole new level to "desktop" games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, Fiona is rather chunky for a 10.1" tablet - by a rough estimate it weighs around 1.5kg. That's heavy to hold up for a long time, but if you prop it up on your lap you shouldn?t have a problem. Razer was mum on battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is still in developmental stage and the design and some of the specs may change by the time it arrives in Q4, 2012. No exact price has been revealed but Razer plans to keep it under a $1,000.</paragraph>
