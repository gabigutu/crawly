			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson don?t believe in the one-size-fits-all concept. Their XPERIA lineup stretches from XS to XL. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 fits right in the middle. A grown X10 mini or a smaller X10, the X8 will do well either way because it?s average in a good way. Its job is to attract the people who were put off by the size extremes of the X10s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the X10 mini, the camera on the X8 has been downgraded to 3MP fixed-focus, but the screen has grown to a healthy 3 inches and the resolution has doubled ?improving both the image quality and giving the custom Android UI more room to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the package was left intact ? down to the complimentary 2GB microSD card in the box. We hear the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 will be priced at around 200 euro, which will make good value for money.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s face it, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and X10 mini are niche products ? one for the high-end loving crowd and the other for those fascinated by the tiny yet powerful smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X8 on the other hand is aimed at the masses. The 600MHz CPU won?t break any speed records, but Sony Ericsson have optimized their custom interface to the point of giving you a smooth and consistent run ? which at times does feel blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no n-enabled Wi-Fi radio or Bluetooth 3.0 support, but honestly, how many of you actually use those? Wi-Fi b/g, Bluetooth 2.1 and A-GPS along with HSDPA-enabled 3G give the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 all the connectivity most people will ever need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the XPERIA X8 is not a ?feature superior? phone, it won?t make the competition cower in fear. But it tries to give the majority of consumers a feature-rich package at a reasonable price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip to the next page where we begin our investigation into whether or not the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 keeps that promise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Disclaimer: The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 review unit used for this article is technically a pre-release version. Further changes and optimizations in both software and hardware (internals) are quite likely. This is the reason we're going for our shorter type of article, which we call "preview". As usual, we'll do a full-length in-depth review, as soon as we get a final retail version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 99 x 54 x 15 mm the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 is a compact phone, just not as tiny as the X10 mini. This leaves enough room for a 3? HVGA screen, so that the custom Android UI doesn?t feel cramped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 104g is at the lower end of what you can feel in your pocket, though the 15mm of thickness are a bit above the average for an Android smartphone. Still, it?s comfortable to hold and comfortable to use single-handedly ? you can easily reach all the controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 looks like a stretched out X10 mini, which in turn looked like an X10 in miniature. So, there?s a clean line of succession in terms of design. It?s not as boxy as the mini and not as much of a slab as the big X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 doesn?t have a ?premium? feel to it. Still, it hides fingerprints and helps keep the weight down. The matt finish on the front is pretty good at concealing fingerprints too (especially the white one), but the screen is a fingerprint-magnet ? just as any other touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen on the front has grown almost half an inch over the X10 mini?s and has double the resolution: HVGA. The image is much crisper and you won?t feel like an elephant in a china shop thumbing your way through the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen sensitivity, as was to be expected in a capacitive unit, is excellent. The slightest of touches is enough for a click to be registered, for a great touchscreen experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 65K-color limitation inherent to Android versions prior to 2.0 could result in the occasional banding but it?s not as easily noticeable on a screen this size. If the X8 receives the Android 2.1 update those issues should be solved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is passable as far as TFT displays go, with good brightness and contrast. Viewing angles are good too. Sunlight legibility on the XPERIA X8 is poor too ? the screen reflects too much light making it near impossible to use the phone on a bright sunny day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware keys ? contextual menu, home and the back button. Those are thin buttons but nicely raised and with good press feedback. What?s missing in the Android standard assortment of keys is the search key ? you get a search widget on the homescreen instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find a status LED, the earpiece, as well as proximity and ambient light sensors. There?s no option to deactivate the auto-brightness. The proximity sensor is in charge of locking the display when you hold it next to your ear during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA 8 follow the X10 and X10 mini arrangement. The left side is left completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right you get a volume rocker and a shutter key. The volume rocker is too thin ? thinner than the keys below the screen. The shutter key is not all too comfortable either but it?s a fixed-focus camera after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the handset is the screen lock key which also acts as a power button. It?s small and barely protrudes but we guess it was done on purpose to minimize accidental presses. More often than not it needs a push with a fingernail really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 you?ll also find the audio jack and the microUSB port. The audio jack is absolutely compatible with standard 3.5mm plugs but the unusual shape is designed to accommodate the optional Hi-Fi Sony Ericsson MH-810 headset with music controls remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a protective cap over the microUSB port (which is too hard to open), while the audio jack is exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features just the mic pinhole and the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone hosts the 3 megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker. The camera is not covered but quite inset, giving it a reasonable protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment. The microSD slot is hot-swap enabled though not accessible without opening the battery cover. The good news here is that the battery is removable, as opposed to the one of X10 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the back and the front cover come off relatively easy ? this means you can quickly dress up your XPERIA X8 in new colors and there are plenty to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 fits very well in the hand. Its medium size and slightly curved back make it comfortable to hold and even the 15mm thickness didn?t bother us that much as the curved corners help mask some of the thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The absence of premium finish is understandable ? you can?t have swappable panels if they?re made of metal and even the XPERIA Pureness, which was more about show than features, was plastic.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Small user interface on a bigger screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 runs version 1.6 of the Android platform with Sony Ericsson?s own touches. The X10 bunch are up for update to 2.1 Eclair soon ? so, maybe the X8 will get a piece of that too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did a lengthy hands-on video of the XPERIA X8 for our blog yesterday, so we'll list it here as well. If you've already watched it, you can skip it this time. If not, you really should. It would give you a general feel for the snappiness of the phone and the organization of the custom UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X8 uses the same homescreen as its smaller sibling, the X10 mini. However this time the screen has HVGA resolution, which is still the most popular screen res on Android, and with its 3 inches, it?s a lot roomier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?re still limited to one widget per screen. And no shortcuts or folders either. And those widgets leave a lot of unused space ? Sony Ericsson could have easily fit two widgets per screen. At least, you get as many homescreen panes as you want (as many widgets as you have, that is) and they are easy to rearrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handy corner shortcuts from the X10 mini make an appearance here as well. By default, they lead to the message composer, music player, phonebook and dial pad/call log. You could switch them with any four shortcuts you like though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android?s notification area, which is one of our favorite features, is as always at the top of the screen. It's a thin bar with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events. Sliding it down however reveals the whole story - you get a list of all recent notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X8 packs the Timescape UI plug-in but lacks the Mediascape. In fact, Timescape is available as a separate application and its job is to bring all your communications together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It always displays an aggregated view of your SMS, MMS, email, missed calls, Facebook and Twitter updates all on one screen. It also has a large number of tabs to filter the content by type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the X8 you press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. It gives you access to the six most recently used apps. Due to the logic of the operating system, some of them might be hibernating rather than actually running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 uses the same CPU as pint-sized X10 mini and despite having twice as much pixels to update on-screen, the whole interface is very fast. As far the UI is concerned, it doesn?t take a Snapdragon ? everything works fine, without hiccups.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging enjoys the virtual QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple. There?s the new message button on top and a list of all your messages organized into threads beneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. The standard email app doesn?t do threaded email ? this is enabled in Gmail only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Instant Messaging app that comes with Android is Google Talk ? and it?s very good. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger screen on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 makes a virtual QWERTY feasible. In portrait mode, the keys are quite small, but once you turn it to landscape mode things get a lot more comfortable. The virtual keyboard won?t please heavy texters perhaps but it?s good enough for occasional use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is pretty basic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 is the same as on the X10 mini ? and that didn?t impress us much. It manages your audio files decently but there is very little extra functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still no equalizer presets preinstalled, nor any alternative skins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t even gradual typing for searching a specific song this time so you will have to use the kinetic scrolling or opt for artist sorting. At least there are three smart playlists that automatically gather your newly added, most played and never played tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you unplug the headset, the music automatically pauses ? hit play and it will continue playing on the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best bit about the player is the Infinite button that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or in PlayNow. You could also use TrackID to sample music and find out track and artist info along.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3MP camera seems low for an XPERIA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 has been downgraded compared to its Android siblings. It?s a fixed-focus 3MP camera with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is as simple as it gets with three buttons in total. There is a camera/camcorder switch, a gallery button and scene mode switch. The four available scene presets include Twilight, Sports, Landscape and, of course, Auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s all the interface there is ? you don?t even get a settings menu (so, you can?t change the image resolution for example). But if you go into Settings (the Android settings menu that is), Application Settings and Camera, you can enable/disable geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that there?s much to tune on a 3MP fixed focus snapper. And if the photos turn out ok with minimum user interaction ? well, that?s not a bad thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the image quality is not good enough even by 3MP standards. The noise reduction is way too aggressive and turns foliage into green smudges. Contrast and colors seem OK though and there?s still time till the XPERIA X8 gets launched. Sony Ericsson might be able to tweak the settings and squeeze some more image quality out of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though the still imaging capabilities on the XPERIA X8 were demoted, video capture is intact. The camcorder manages VGA video at 30 frames per second ? you didn?t expect HD video, did you?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera ? you can set the video quality to default or MMS mode. That?s all the settings available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos shot with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 are at VGA resolution and you get a relatively good output. We'd wait for sunny weather before we pass judgment on detail but overall, the video turn out nice and the 30fps make for smooth playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 camera sample video ? VGA@30fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser needs Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android OS comes with an excellent WebKit-based browser and the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 does not make an exception. The browser is unchanged from what we saw on the X10 mini, but the bigger screen and resolution let it shine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is rather minimalist ? by default all the controls are hidden. But when you scroll or pan, the virtual zoom keys and the overview key show up for a little while before fading out again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the browser on the X8 mini supports only a single zoom method ? the dedicated onscreen buttons. There is no double tap or one-finger zooming. Which is strange ? the Gallery app supports one finger zooming (you tap and hold then slide up or down to zoom in/out). This isn?t a final version we?re testing, so maybe Sony Ericsson will add this feature by launch time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the browser supports text re-flow ? as soon as you zoom, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is minimalist but it still offers enough functions. Hit the menu key and four keys pop up ? Go button, tabs button, favorites and more options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is the infamous absentee on the X8 browser. Flash 10.1 is available for Android 2.2 Froyo but it?s another matter when the XPERIA X8 will be updated ? we?re still waiting for those 2.1 Eclair updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the YouTube app handles the video viewing part of the Flash experience. Even on sites that have embedded YouTube players, you?ll see the preview snapshot of the video and tapping the Play button will launch the video player.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>High-end touch phones are the attention grabbers, but it?s mid-rangers that make the cash register ring. And the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 offers a compelling package at an attractive price ? what we?ve heard so far is the X8 will be priced around 200 euro (250 US dollars).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if Sony Ericsson manages to meet that mark, the XPERIA X8 will be a smart buy. The custom UI they?ve put on Android is fast, intuitive and pretty complete, plus they?re promising an OS update to 2.1 Eclair not long after launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timescape works as promised ? all communication channels are piped into one single place. This makes juggling the numerous 21st century methods of communication as easy as things were at the dawn of mobile telephony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8?s competition is already in stores ? the Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3, the I5700 Galaxy Spica and the LG GT540 Optimus have similar prices and specs. And the Galaxy duo is already running 2.1 Eclair. The now ageing HTC Hero can also be found at a similar price point as those three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 ? Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica ? LG GT540 Optimus ? HTC Hero</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the XPERIA X8 was available right now it would probably be selling quite well. But it isn?t ? and that?s a problem. It?s not available, it doesn?t have Android 2.1 Eclair and 2.2 Froyo is just a distant dream.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, even if all goes well, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 might still arrive late to the party. A positive look on things is that the X8 is a compact, capable smartphone with good looks and a low price ? this could be just enough to keep users interested.</paragraph>
