			<subsectionTitle>Main shortcomings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unless you need the S Pen, the S7 edge offers the same specs for less money</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Iris scanner needs you to hold the phone awkwardly close to your face</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hybrid slot means people using the dual-SIM model can't expand the storage (64GB should be enough for most, though)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All great speeches start with carefully prepared notes. For yet another year Samsung has taken the role of a modern-day orator, pushing for a return to personal handwriting against the trend of detached digital text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the S Pen that gives the Galaxy Note7 and its predecessors their unique identity and writing on the screen with the new S Pen feels the most natural yet. And with this generation, you can even scribble notes where the screen is off and it would happily venture where most electronics would not dare - underwater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note7 also represents the first major design change in the flagship Galaxy line since the S6 (the S7 was just a thicker version of that). The symmetrical dual-curved design makes the beautiful screen appear borderless while making a big phone feel smaller than it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the S Pen is undoubtedly the heart of the Note experience, the screen is a close second. The Edge features that debuted with 2014's Note Edge were perfected through the S6 edge and S7 edge of the following years. Even the Always on screen was improved, despite being only months old (perhaps it was just waiting for the S Pen, their interaction is the best new feature).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some things may not sound particularly exciting, but users have waited a long time for them. The S5 was waterproof, but there hasn't been a waterproof Note before, the Note7 is the first one. The microSD slot came back after only a year of absence but to some Note 4 users looking for an upgrade that was a year too long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are features that are completely new to Samsung phones in general - the iris scanner, the USB Type-C port, and the HDR video capable display. We think at least two of those will become a mainstay of flagship phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps we mentioned the Note5 too often for an intro to the Note7 review. But you have to understand that the 5 was the trouble child of the family, and it left a void, especially in Europe, where the S6 edge+ had to replace it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it didn't do too good with the Note crowd, which swears by their S Pens. But the dual-curved screen stuck and that's how the Samsung Galaxy Note7 was born.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note7 is available with two different chipsets - Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 8890. We're covering both with this review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung Galaxy Note7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 came in an ink-black box (nature-friendly soy ink, specifically) with glossy embossed letters. The carbon footprint is tracked by the Carbon Trust for extra nature points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, it's a well-stocked box, even without the launch-day freebies that Samsung is offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get an Adaptive Fast charger (9V at 1.67A = 15W), a USB cable (full-size A to Type-C), two adapters (Type-C to full-size A and Type-C to microUSB 2.0), some spare S Pen tips and a tool to replace them yourself. As for the card ejector tool, it's hidden in the box that holds the manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung packaged the snazzy headset that it puts in recent flagship launches (EO-EG920BW). It's a premium headset with canal-type buds, 12mm drivers, tangle-resistant cables and a microphone with wind noise protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sidenote: we mentioned freebies, and we're sure we've got your attention. Here's the deal - Samsung's official store and some retailers and carriers will offer a choice of several items when you pre-order the phone. In the US, the choice is between a Gear Fit2 smart band or a 256GB microSD card (some also offer a year of Netflix). In Europe, it seems early birds will get the new Gear VR headset bundled instead. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note7 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 measures 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9mm, that's taller and thicker than the Note5. And yet, its design makes it feel smaller. It's certainly noticeably more compact than an iPhone 6s Plus. And being as narrow as it definitely helps in everyday handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is barely larger than the 5.5" Galaxy S7 edge (and we know this because we compared them side by side, otherwise you may not notice).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Famous sculptors will tell you that beauty lies in symmetry and Samsung heeded their advice. The Galaxy Note7 is symmetrical - its left and right sides are identically curved on the front and back. And in our humble opinion, it's one of the best-looking pieces of hardware Samsung has ever put out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen curves aren't as pronounced as those on the S7 edge (yay!), they have a smaller radius. Some people were worried that the curves would interfere with the S Pen, but you naturally leave margins as you write, so Note7's curved screen edges aren't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These curves are still enough to make the phone feel narrower than the Note5, it even feels as pocketable as the S7 edge size-wise (it's not really that compact, though). The new Galaxy Note7 will win over many people who may have been on the fence about larger phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curving sides help mask the bezels, which are now almost invisible, it's a striking appearance. Don't worry about accidental presses; the Note7 can detect where your palm touches the screen and will not react to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With this much glass, Samsung went with the new, tougher Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the exterior (the Note7 is the first phone to use it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass covers both the front and back, the metal frame is sandwiched between both panes. On the sides, the frame is very thin, but it gets thicker around the top and bottom to accommodate ports, slots, and other hardware features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass back and the thin metal sides surprisingly offer decent grip, but it's not the best. A case goes a long way here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front looks slightly differently, due to the addition of an iris scanner on the right of the earpiece, next to the regular selfie cam. It's essentially a second front camera, but it sees infrared light. To help it in the dark, there's an IR LED (left to the earpiece, you can see it light up in a dull red when it's active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a decently-sized notification LED to the left of the infrared LED (it's not visible when it's off).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the other biometric sensor - the fingerprint reader on the Home key. To its side are capacitive keys (App switcher and Back), which are invisible when off and their backlight goes out quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This shows Samsung likes the sleek look of having few buttons, but it refuses to move to on-screen buttons. We get the practicality of having the buttons fill the otherwise unoccupied lower bezel, but sometimes we wonder if it's time to take the plunge and move to virtual keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, three keys we prefer to stay physical are the Power button on the right and Volume keys on the left. They are on the thin side, but are easy enough to find by touch and they offer a solid click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Galaxy Note7 is rather baren - no IR blaster, sorry, there's only a microphone and the card slot. It's a hybrid slot that accepts two cards - nanoSIM and microSD, but on dual-SIM models you can drop the extra storage in favor of another phone line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 64GB as base (and so far only) storage option, we'd be okay with using two SIMs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone is quite busy. The new attraction is the USB Type-C - the reversible connector that wears many hats. This is a first for Samsung, we'll cover the port's functionality (and there's plenty of it) on the next page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is the trademark S Pen stylus. You have to push in with your finger so it 'clicks' (like a pen) and the top part sticks out, allowing you to pull it out. There's no chance it will ever fall out accidentally and you can't insert it backward like you could with the Note5 (which had the unfortunate side effect of damaging the slot's shaft mechanism).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another first for the Galaxy Note line is the waterproofing. The Galaxy Note7 is IP68-certified, officially it can last for up to 30 minutes underwater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port is left uncovered, but don't worry - the phone will warn you if it detects moisture in the port and will refuse to charge until it's dry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do need to charge near the pool, you should invest in the Backpack - a 3,100mAh power bank that uses wireless charging to top up the Note7 battery. It's water resistant, just like the phone itself!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is not removable, so you can't access the battery. That's one feature from the Note 4 that we don't think is coming back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the back is almost flush with the back and features Samsung's sports sensors - heart rate and blood oxygen. This is Galaxy S7's excellent camera, but the software has been retouched so we expect some improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're particularly fond of the new color scheme for the Note family - Coral Blue. Notes started off as business phones and they came in business-friendly colors (aside from the occasional Pink version for Valentines).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This new one is a dual-tone paint job. The metal parts and certain accents are gold (looks close to Samsung's Rose gold) and the expansive areas under the glass (front and back) are blue. It looks great in person and we hope Samsung will release more like this in the coming months (for those that don't care for the Blue/Gold combo).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After the innovative side-curve on the Galaxy Note Edge, Samsung put its main focus on the Galaxy S line and the Note5 was looked over. This year, the Note is the one getting special treatment and it now comes with a dual curved screen. If rumors are to be believed, Samsung wants to go curved-only with its flagships going forward, so let's gaze into the (potential) future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matrix still measures 5.7" in diagonal, but its left and right sides are curled down. This, essentially, reserves the sides of the screen for special functions (we explore them on the next page - yes, we filled half a page with just the features based on the screen curve).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note7 is the first phone to wear Gorilla Glass 5. Corning claims that the glass will survive "shoulder-height drops" (1.6m/5" 3in) 80% of the time. So not "shatterproof" but 4x better than other kinds of glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Behind it all, sits Samsung's flagship AMOLED matrix with QHD (1,440 x 2,560px) resolution though it seems some tweaking has occurred since the S7 edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen reaches a higher maximal brightness of around 430nits when in manual mode. Auto mode (at its discretion) can drive the brightness even higher; 650nits is the highest we observed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color rendering has shifted a bit too - in Basic mode, the one designed for accuracy, it reaches the very good 2.7 average deltaE and 4.4 max. Still, the S7 edge did 0.8 and 1.5 respectively, even last year's Note5 did 1.1 and 2.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basic can look a bit plain to the casual users and unless you can name one color profile, we recommend you stick to one of the other three options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adaptive display is the default, and it tweaks the settings based on screen content. The Red channel gets oversaturated and pushes the max deltaE to 12.3. The Green channel is off too and the white balance shifts slightly towards blue (a common trick to make white appear extra white).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLED photo is the next step, which oversaturates colors and increases contrast, but to a lesser degree than Adaptive display. Then AMOLED Cinema pushes things even closer to the accurate Basic mode. It's a trade-off - these modes are fairly accurate, but still make the image pop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no color shift when you tilt the display, not even on the curved sides (they do reflect light from a different angle, but the color remains the same). We've seen some 2.5D displays (flat screen, curved glass on top) create some prismatic effects, but there's none of that here (an advantage of the curved display).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 is one of the first mobile devices to support HDR video. It's not HDR like in the camera. This one has 10-bit color instead of 8-bit, that's four times the number of shades. This prevents color banding and enables detailed scenes that feature both very bright and very dark areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR video content is fairly limited at the moment, but Amazon Video and Netflix do have some. Also, the Xbox One S launched recently with HDR video as one of its key selling points, which should help drive demand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note7 brings another picture-enhancing toggle - Video Enhancer. This one works in all video apps (even third-party ones) and brightens the image and makes colors more vivid (it simulates HDR video). Note that this option also enhances audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty is the Blue light filter, which we've seen it before on other Androids before (but is new to the Galaxy line). The idea is that natural light is blue during the day and fades to yellow in the evening. Looking at blue light, even from a small screen, can mess up your body's internal clock and make it think it's daytime. The filter can be toggled manually, but it's best scheduled to turn on in the evening and turn off at dawn.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity, an ode to USB Type-C<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note7 is the first Samsung phone with a reversible USB Type-C port. Even so, the company is unwilling to break away from USB 2.0 and has included two adapters - one Type-C to full-size USB 2.0 and one to microUSB 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big adapter lets you connect any USB accessory with the ubiquitous port. You can even connect your old phone and have the Galaxy NOte7 transfer all information when you set it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB adapter is more for convenience - it allows you to use a regular microUSB cable or charger with the Note 7. It doesn't have USB host functionality unlike thebigger adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that both adapters work at (relatively) slow USB 2.0 speeds (even the big one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike older USB standards, Type-C has an official TV-out standard - DisplayPort. So you are only a cable away from hooking the Note7 to an HDMI port on your TV or external monitor. But in the times of wireless casting, this option is starting to look well over its due date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wired connection can also be used in your car as long as the head unit supports MirrorLink. This standard mirrors the phone's screen (including touch input) onto the head unit. From the settings, you'll easily find an alternative launcher with big, easy to hit icons (the CarmodeStub we saw on the Galaxy Note5 too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired connections aside, the Samsung Galaxy Note7 offers blazing wireless Internet speeds. It varies by region, but you may get LTE Cat. 12 (or Cat. 10 or 9). Honestly, your carrier's network is probably not even as fast as needed to support it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi is fast too - with 2x2 MIMO and 802.11ac it can reach speeds up to 620Mbps. Again, it may turn out that your router is slowing down the Note. The latest Bluetooth 4.2 with LE and ANT+ are available as well. Global positioning is handled by GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Pay using either NFC based contactless payment terminals NFC or by emulating old-school MST technology - essentially the older cards, which only rely on magnetic strips (more common in the US than Europe).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 has a sealed 3,500mAh battery. That's a 500mAh upgrade over the old Note5, but 100mAh short of the Galaxy S7 edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen excellent performance from Samsung's screen and chipset (Qualcomm's Snapdragon too), so we expect solid results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has designed a new Power saving system too, which is powerful and flexible. It has two modes - Mid and Max - and each shows an estimate on how long the phone will last.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are fully customizable. You can limit brightness and performance, also prevent background Internet usage (both mobile data and Wi-Fi). You can also reduce the resolution to 1080p or even 720p to reduce the load on the chipset. This way you can have the best of both worlds - the sharpness of a QHD screen and the power efficiency of a low-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Game tools have a separate Power saving feature. When it's off, games get the full resolution and target 60fps. The 'Save power' mode drops the resolution (to 1080p, we guess). The 'Save maximum power' drops the resolution further (720p? it's not explicitly stated) and caps the frame rate at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're very impressed by Samsung's new power saving features. They have good defaults, but their customizability gives Power users the chance to optimize battery life completely. Even third-party tools that require root access aren't this extensive in their feature set and they certainly don't come with such a nice and easy to understand interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we tried an old fast charger, one with a microUSB 2.0 cable, and the small Type-C to microUSB 2.0 adapter from Galaxy Note7's box didn't interfere with its work in any way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even without resorting to power saving features, the Galaxy Note7 is a great performer. We measured 90h Endurance for the Exynos 8890 version and 81h for the Snapdragon 820 one (the two S7 edge models showed similar scores). The Always On screen cuts off about 30% of the total Endurance time on both versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that Always On adjusts its brightness based on ambient light, so it will use a lot less power at night than it will sitting on your desk. Also, if you want to save power while you're sleeping, you can enable Night clock, which displays a tiny window with the time and disables the big AOD view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scores are slightly worse than what the Galaxy S7 edge managed. The bigger screen is probably to blame, the 100mAh difference in battery size couldn't have changed much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Exynos model proves more efficient, beating the Snapdragon model by about an hour and a half in the Web and Video tests and by three hours in the Talk time test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We measured the charging speed of the Galaxy Note7 using the provided Adaptive Fast charger (9V x 1.67A = 15W). Starting with a flat battery, the Note7 had 38% charge after half an hour (the phone was on but idling, Always On screen enabled). It took a total of 1 hour and 35 minutes to reach 100% charge, fast indeed.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a world where people rarely use actual pens, Samsung is asking them to use a digital one. And many say yes!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen has been updated to feel more natural. The tip is much thinner to simulate a ballpoint pen. The button has been moved up to prevent accidental presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stylus is more accurate than before too. It can detect up to 4,096 different levels of pressure (that's twice as its predecessor), and its position is tracked 360 times a second. Using it scribble was the closest to a real pen that we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With each iteration, Samsung adds new features but we think this is the best update yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most eye-catching trick is that you can write underwater. Not that you'd ever need to, but it's a cool demo and you have the certainty that a wet screen will not interfere with what you're doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most useful trick, however, is the Screen-off memo. Just pull out the S Pen while the phone is locked and start writing. Tap Save and it goes into your Samsung Memo app. The process is so natural, soon you'll use the Note7 just like a regular notepad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only that but you can also pin a note to the Always on screen so it's visible without having to unlock the phone (again, like a regular notepad!). The unintuitive and hard to discover part is that to reveal the note, you have to double tap the tiny Pin icon that appears under the AOD clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the S Pen has other tricks. It can help reading comprehension by serving as a magnifying glass for text (so it's easier to read) and it can even translate words from one language to another just by hovering over them (but only one word at a time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can do other things too - scroll just by hovering over an edge, capture screenshots (even if you have to scroll), creating animated GIFs and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These features are launched from the Air Command menu. You get to it by either tapping the small, translucent icon that sits at the edge of your screen or by pressing the button on the S Pen itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Always on screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S7's Always on screen was somewhat limited, but the Note7 adds some new functionality and also variety. Now you get to choose from 13 clock styles, two calendar styles or four images that can be shown on the screen, while it's off. Even better, third-party apps notifications show up on the AOD with the app's icon and double tapping it would take you directly to the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AOD functionality can be scheduled in case you don't need it all day. It's worth noting that it would also switch off on its own after a while if you put the phone in a dark place - such as in a drawer, a pocket or a purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A variation of the AOD is the Night clock - it's dim and unobtrusive always on clock that won't bother you if you keep it on even in a pitch dark room. The Night clock takes precedence and disables the Always on screen so you can't have both.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Edge screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Edge screen is a very convenient shortcut to many features. You pull it out by swiping from the right edge of the screen (you can switch that to the left).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default it has four panels you can swipe through: Apps edge (pre-configured app shortcuts), People edge (pre-configured contact shortcuts), Tasks edge (various shortcuts, e.g. Take selfie or Create event) and My places. The latter lets you customize the content of other panels based on location - Home, Work or Out and about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can deactivate Edge panels you don't want and enable others (including downloading additional panels). We quite like the Calendar, which puts an agenda for the day always in reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edge panels work on the lockscreen, but not while the screen is off. For that you have the Edge feeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edge feeds are activated by "rubbing" the edge of the phone. Two are pre-installed: notifications and S Health. The notifications feed does show all your phone's notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can flip between feeds with a swipe, especially useful if you use more than one (you can download additional ones, but currently only CNN and RSS feeds are available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third and final Edge screen feature is Edge lighting. It's a prettier, easier to notice notification light. It works when the Galaxy Note7 is face down and uses the sides of the screen to create a colorful aura around the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Iris scanner and security<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung isn't the first to put an iris scanner on a phone (Microsoft did it first on the Lumia 950 and 950XL), but we suspect it will be the first to popularize it (Lumias are rarer than unicorns these days).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iris scanner fills much the same niche as the fingerprint scanner, in fact soon the two may be used interchangeably. This means securing the lockscreen, Samsung Pay and Knox, the new Secure folder, even web logins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iris scanners are presumably more secure - fingerprints can be "lifted," irises can't. And they work even when your fingers are wet and pruney.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not without its downsides. We most miss that it's not always on - you can unlock the phone with the fingerprint scanner in one motion, but not with the iris scanner. It needs you to wake the phone first, then swipe to unlock and only then line up your eyes to be scanned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That last bit is tricky too, as you have to hold the phone relatively close to your face and the positioning is done in fairly narrow margins, which slows things even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now, we predict the fingerprint scanner will continue to be the preferred security solution though it doesn't hurt having both on. The added benefit of iris scanning (if it's used at all) will be reserved for more sensitive areas - like the Secure folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What is the Secure folder, anyway? It is what it says on the tin - a special folder on the device that can securely hold files, memos and apps. It's locked independently from the lockscreen - one can use a fingerprint, the other an iris.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even install two copies of an app - one in plain sight and one in the Secure folder. And you can hide the folder too, so people can snoop all they want and will not find anything suspicious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung says Secure folder is like having a second phone. You can launch the camera from here and photos you take go straight into the secure gallery. There are secure Contacts too, calls to them do not show up in the regular call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, it took us a while to figure out where our screenshots of the Secure folder UI went - well, in the Secure folder, of course! Samsung has gone to great lengths to ensure things stay locked up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 runs a TouchWiz-skinned Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. An update to v7.0 Nougat is already planned, but it should take a few months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader used on the Note7 is the same as the one on the Galaxy S7. It recognizes a finger in under a second - very fast, though not the fastest we've seen. All it takes to unlock the phone is to press the Home key and leave your finger for a moment longer while the fingerprint reader does its thing. Then there's the iris scanner too, when you get used to it, it can be as fast as the fingerprint reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note7 brings some changes to the TouchWiz interface, but it's a collection of minor tweaks rather than a major redesign.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on where you are in the world, your leftmost homescreen would be either the Flipboard-powered Briefing or Upday (this is the one we got on our international unit). The two do pretty much the same thing - they aggregate news according to a pre-defined list of interests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification area has a revamped layout. The screen brightness slider is no longer visible on the first swipe. Instead, it has been moved next to the quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is a new search field. This isn't Google Now's search, instead, it searches for local files and apps as well as nearby devices for wireless connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note7 user interface is fully themeable. We only got one theme pre-installed, but the Theme Store has more for you to download. By the way, there is an option to disable the app drawer, so you may want to give it a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Split-screen multitasking is supported on the Note7, and the 5.7" screen was born to do it. Even at half a screen, apps get plenty of room (Material design likes a lot of padding though). As always, only supported apps can work in split-screen (you'll recognize them by a button in the app switcher, next to the X). Also, Samsung's implementation is the most widely supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Floating app windows are supported for some apps, too. The precision allowed by the S Pen's tip (compared to your finger) makers using apps even in this downscaled state a breeze. Some hover features are a great help too, like hovering near the edge of an app scrolls its window in that direction (great for using a minimized web browser).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some cool gestures are available for the Galaxy Note7 - you can flip the phone for mute, swipe your palm for screenshot, double-tap the Home key for quick camera access, quick call, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our international Samsung Galaxy Note7 comes free of bloatware, but has a few Microsoft apps pre-installed (MS Office, OneDrive with 100GB for 2-years, Skype). You can disable them, but not completely delete them. The US model we received (T-Mobile) had a few extra carrier-specific apps and also Amazon's mobile app preinstalled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Cloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the Note7 event, Samsung unveiled the Samsung Cloud and this is the first phone to support it. Basically, you get 15GB of cloud storage dedicated to backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz software can natively stash away Contacts, Calendar events, S Pen creations from Samsung Note and some other things into the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos, videos and stories from the gallery are saved too (though 15GB might be a tight fit if you shoot a lot of 4K video). Browser tabs (for the Internet app, not Chrome) are synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can selectively force particular content to be synced over Wi-Fi only. For instance, small calendar notes can always be up to date, but big gallery files will not eat up your data allowance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that Samsung Cloud isn't (yet) a competitor to Dropbox or Google Drive. It's focused on backups, and there's no option just to lob a random file in there and share it with other devices/people.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Game Launcher<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Game Launcher shows just how serious Samsung is about dominating the mobile gaming market. It groups all your games in one place, so they don't get lost in the busy app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's just convenience, the Game Launcher has some life-saving features. You can disable notifications during a game and lock the App switcher and Back keys - no more interruptions or exiting a game by accident at the wrong moment!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is done through the Game Tools key, a small floating virtual key you can position pretty much anywhere on the screen. Once tapped, it reveals a menu very similar to the Air Command for the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These days, many people watch others (streamers) play games. The Galaxy Note7 can't livestream gameplay, but it can record it for you. And it can add the video feed from the selfie camera, as is standard on Twitch and other places where game playthroughs are shared. Naturally, it can record your commentary through the microphone too (or you can disable both features if you prefer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Game Launcher also offers Top Charts and Featured Videos tabs, where you can check game stats, and find gameplay videos based on what you have installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VR games are a hot selling point right now and in some regions (Europe but not the US) early Note7 buyers can get a free Gear VR headset. It's the redesigned one that is compatible with older devices as well (Galaxy S6 and S7, Note5). We have a detailed hands-on with the headset where we cover the mobile VR experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is building two versions of the Galaxy Note7 - the international one with an Exynos 8890 chipset and one for North America and China with Snapdragon 820. Both come with 4GB of RAM. That's right, there's basically no improvement since the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have both versions to test. They promise similar performance though they do differ in a few places. It's not enough of a difference to be worth importing the version not available in your region. Also, note that China is getting a version with 6GB of RAM (and 128GB storage), but so far there are no plans to bring that to the international market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year Samsung easily claimed the performance crown - as Qualcomm Snapdragon stumbled, Exynos ruled the land. This year the Snapdragon 820 is excellent and many phones use it, so the Note7 will not enjoy a performance lead like the Note5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the opening salvo, the Moto Z Droid and OnePlus 3 top the Note7 in overall performance (at least according to AnTuTu 6). The OnePlus does have 6GB of RAM, but that's probably not it - both it and the Moto use leaner, less customized Android builds than the Samsung phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS 2.0 shows the Moto Z Droid as maintaining a very narrow lead. It seems to like the Exynos version of the Galaxy Note7 a lot more than it did the S7 edge (Exynos). Samsung definitely tuned things under the hood - some benches aren't affected by that, but others show signs of improvement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 8890 Galaxy Note7s perform fairly evenly. Digging into details reveals some differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Exynos wins in multithreaded tests - it has eight cores to Snapdragon's four. The Huawei P9 Plus also has eight cores, and they run at higher clock speeds than Note7's so it claims the top place here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 820 isn't out of the competition yet, it takes back a point in single-core tests - the individual Kryo cores are faster than even the custom Mongoose cores in the Exynos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chipset trivia: Mongoose is Samsung's answer to Cortex-A72/A73. The Exynos 8890 has four of those in a big.LITTLE setup with four standard A53 cores. Kryo is a fully custom core designed by Qualcomm. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that's the trade off - few big cores or many smaller ones. In practice, you may not notice a difference outside of synthetic tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one place the Snapdragon 820 clearly has the upper hand is graphics. Qualcomm has its in-house Adreno team to call on and the 530 is a little beast. Samsung meanwhile relies on ARM's Mali division and Exynos 8890 has 12 cores of Mali-T880. Comparing that to the Huawei P9 Plus, its Kirin 955 chipset has only 4 cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The differences mostly show up in 1080p offscreen tests as opposed to the full res QHD on-screen tests but those matter, too . From the Game Launcher you can force any game to a lower resolution - 1080p or even 720p.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Settings matter too, Exynos is faster than Snapdragon in Basemark X, but only when it is set to medium graphics.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X (medium)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 is one of the fastest phones on the market, consistently sticking close to the top of charts. There is plenty of competition with Snapdragon 820 out there, however, so this year the Galaxy Note doesn't completely dominate the field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't think there's a big difference if you get a Snapdragon or Exynos powered Note7. Yes, the Snapdragon puts out a few frames per second more in some games, but in others, the Exynos is better. Don't fret it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 is available as a single-SIM phone (like the unit we have), but there is a model with dual-SIM support with a hybrid slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook are pretty much the usual TouchWiz deal. There are no special dialer-specific tricks that the S Pen can do, but it's still quite useful for taking notes during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode can be put on an automated schedule. When it's on, only priority notifications can get through and you decide what counts as "priority" - it can be anything from calls from select contacts to reminders from key apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 scored a Good mark on our loudspeaker test, beating its predecessor (Average) and matching the Galaxy S7 edge. The single speaker produces clean sound even at full volume and performs evenly across different types of audio - music, hands-free calls, ringtones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Writing on the Galaxy Note7 naturally features the S Pen. You can just leave your handwriting as-is or if you want to share your thoughts with others and you're worried about legibility, you can rely on the handwriting recognition instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note7 also features the latest version of the Samsung Keyboard. It's quite feature-packed, with a dedicated numbers row, a row above that for word suggestions and additional characters on each key (accessible via long-press).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even when typing, the S Pen can be useful - you can move the cursor and select text with the accuracy of a mouse (doing the same with your finger is quite inaccurate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If that seems too tall, you can scale the keyboard down (or up, if you want bigger keys). The Space key used to be cramped on the S7 and even the bigger S7 edge, but it's big and easy to hit on the Note7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional typing tools include Swipe input, you can predefine keywords for particular pre-defined phrases and voice dictation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung continues to bundle the Microsoft app package that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Skype.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Drive is pre-installed, however, the actual document editors are not (they are a free download, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-customized web browser features Web sign in - a feature that works as a password manager secured by your iris or fingerprint. This makes logins as simple as unlocking the phone and people can't peek over your shoulder to see your password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Health is on board and it can fully utilize the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors. It also tracks walking/running/cycling and you can manually input water and coffee intake and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Manager has been renamed Device maintenance. It still offers the same features and takes care of battery, RAM, Storage and Device security. This gives you tools to clean-up unnecessary files or track down apps which drain the battery or use too much RAM. There are buttons to do this one by one but also one big Optimize now button to do it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Device Security tab lets you activate Knox (protects the phone and OS from hacking but makes for longer boot times) and scan for malware. The My Knox app lets you separate work and corporate apps and access by creating a secure, isolated space on the phone, which becomes inaccessible as soon as Knox detects an unauthorized change in the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is the default file browser. It features Google Drive integration, but no Samsung Cloud (again, that's for backups, not files). You can ZIP folders to make them easier to share as a single file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Galaxy Apps, Samsung's own app store. Galaxy Essentials is a good place to find great tools (like Kids Mode), but for general app shopping, you would probably be better off with Google Play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz Gallery has been touched up to bring more focus to Stories. Stories are shared, collaborative albums - that means your friends can add their own photos from the party or just a Story on a shared theme (e.g. sunsets).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For your friends without a Galaxy smartphone, Stories are shared over SMS with a link to SamsungCloud.com. A simple (and not very secure) verification is used - the person who receives a link has to type the last four digits of their phone number (not the sender's number). Anyway, from here people can download the Story, but not add to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several image editing tools are available - from basic cropping, to collage making, to a more capable editor (which supports image correction, effects and drawing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the S Pen, you can create short GIFs. You select a portion of the screen and hit record and the unfolding action on this particular area can be then turned into a GIF. The downside is that you can't record your interaction with the user interface so the feature is best suited for making GIFs out of videos or similar content, which would run on its own.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music enhanced by Samsung's AQ features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music is the default player for your tunes on the Galaxy Note7. It can play your local files, as well as stream music from the cloud and it's backed by Samsung's extensive sound enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They include the SoundAlive tool, which has an intuitive interface for tuning the equalizer. Presets and two simple dials are available for basic users, a manual 7-band equalizer for more advanced users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapt Sound is even simpler. It tunes the EQ to your hearing and your particular pair of headphones by playing multiple frequencies and asking how well you hear them. Smart Volume automatically adjusts the volume of tracks from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>UHQ sound resolution enhancer is available as well for upscaling compressed audio. There are also features such as Surround sound emulation and Tube Amp Pro simulator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you truly miss Samsung's player, it's still available in the Galaxy Apps store (look for it under the For Galaxy tab).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no video player app pre-installed and the Gallery handles the videos by default. Like with the music player, you can grab the traditional TouchWiz app from the Galaxy Essentials collection in Galaxy Apps (the Video Editor is there too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Gallery app is up to the task. It has full subtitle support with advanced features to modify their appearance. The app lets you play only the audio track of the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download third-party video players and they can tap into the system-wide Video Enhancer feature as well. We tried VLC, MX Player and BS Player and they were all recognized correctly. Even YouTube worked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This feature tries to make up for the relative lack of HDR content and digi-magically enhances SD video to HDR (it does the same for audio as well). It touches up the contrast curve and color rendering to make the image pop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We downloaded some HDR demo files to play through the gallery, but we didn't notice a difference between what we saw on the Note7 screen and on a S7 edge screen. Samsung says you can find HDR content on Amazon Video (but Netflix has some too).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, given Samsung?s track record in the area, the Galaxy Note7 delivered seriously impressive audio output. The phablet aced the first part of our test mixing very loud output with impeccable quality ? nothing to frown at really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones caused next to no distortion ? even the hike in stereo crosstalk was hard to notice without dedicated equipment. And just to one-up its predecessor this time volume didn?t drop at all here, for a flawless overall showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung came up with an entirely new camera system for the Galaxy S7, and they've used it once again in the Note7 and they've even improved the camera UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features a 12MP camera sensor (4:3 aspect ratio) with the impressive Dual Pixel autofocus tech. It's faster and more accurate than any other system that came before it. It also packs Optical Image Stabilization for better low-light performance (helped by the bright f/1.7 aperture) and reducing handshake in videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most visible change is the interface that has been streamlined. The Mode and Effect buttons are gone, replaced by swipe right for shooting modes and left for photo effects. Swipes up/down flip between the main and the selfie cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting modes are the same as before, including the Pro mode. It gives you manual control over the camera's settings. You can also shoot in RAW so you can manually process photos later. Motion photo is available in the settings menu; it captures a 3-second video, which starts recording from the moment before you've even pressed the shutter (it's a separate MP4 file, which is easy to share).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has touched up the camera internals too so we think it offers slightly better image quality than the S7 duo (well, until a firmware update brings them up to par).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos from the Galaxy Note7 camera are very detailed with little to no noise. Samsung has tuned the processing to make images more punchy - contrast, color saturation, and sharpening are all too strong to our taste. Sure, this makes the images pop even on regular screens (ones that are not Super AMOLED), but we would have liked an option to tone the processing a notch down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of sharpening applied, especially, makes the images look overprocessed when you zoom down to pixel level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the Note7 seems to have a slightly better dynamic range compared to the S7 duo, but we won't know for certain until we've carried out a proper camera shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took several shots after dark. In such conditions, it's best to be careful and snap a couple of photos for safety and tapping on the screen to explicitly focus where you want. We had to toss a few soft photos (focus was in the wrong spot), but where the Note7 got things right, the image quality is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the wide dynamic range of the camera, the Auto HDR mode rarely gets triggered (you can force it 'On' if you like). It does a great job at restoring detail to highlights, but it slightly affects image quality - thin lines develop jaggies and moire effects appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas shot with the Note7 are huge - close to 4,000px vertically and rich with detail. The dynamic range handles the shadows and highlights well, and stitching is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has certainly been conservative with the maximum resolution of the selfie camera (5MP), but the photo quality is quite good nonetheless. Photos are detailed, but you'll want to leave Auto HDR on as the camera's dynamic range isn't as good as on the primary camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Galaxy Note7 camera performs in our Photo quality comparison tool against some other recent cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Note7 in our Photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has produced a Lens case for the Galaxy Note7, which allows for easy attachment of one of the two supplied high-quality lenses. There is a Telephoto lens (2x zoom) and a Wide-angle lens (110° field-of-view). They are unusually high in quality for add-on smartphone lenses, and they work great for both photos and videos. We tried them out and walked away impressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is to buy the Gear 360 camera, which shoots 360° by 180° panoramas in one click - both photos and video! We tried out the Gear 360. If you take 360-degree photos from a day out with friends, you can digitally relive those moments later using the VR goggles as if you are back there again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 can shoot 2160p @ 30fps videos, of course, but it also does 1080p @ 60fps. The extra framerate makes motion appear smoother, an effect visible even in the viewfinder. If you really want to slow down fast motion, though, the 240fps mode is the right pick (it shoots at 720p resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP selfie camera does pretty well and can shoot videos at QHD resolution (2,560 x 1,440px), while most competitors are capped at 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos shot at the top 4K resolution are rich in detail and offer the same image processing as the still camera - slightly over the top when you zoom in. Still, you are a lot less likely to zoom in on a video than a photo, so this isn't such a problem here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p @ 60fps videos are worth your considerations too - not as much detail at the pixel level, but motion becomes noticeably more fluid. You can also do 1080p @ 30fps if you want to save some space (60fps videos are shot at 28 Mbps, 30fps at 17 Mbps), but there's no perceptible change in image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a still frame from Note7 video in controlled conditions against some of the 4K competition.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note7 key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Easily the most beautiful phone by Samsung, feels smaller than its screen size suggests;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We appreciate the iris scanner, and while the implementation is way better than the one on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL, it still has its quirks and may not replace the fingerprint reader when it comes to usability. ;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-curved display has great image quality, the curves enable the unique Edge features (panels and feeds), and they don't interfere with the S Pen functionality;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Always On Display has been improved and now shows third-party app notifications and then, there is the Screen off memo; AOD does take a toll on battery life, though;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plenty of storage out of the box, dual-SIM phones have hybrid slots but with 64GB as base storage you can get by without a microSD card;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is marginally improved compared to the Note5, but the bigger screen has meant higher power draw compared to the S7 edge; the Exynos model is slightly more efficient than the Snapdragon one;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is moving towards using fewer proprietary apps - they are offering system-wide video and sound enhancements, which would work with any video or music player you download;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great performance from either chipset, but this time around there is not a clear lead against other flagships;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker has improved since the Note5, and now matches the Galaxy S7 edge with a Good rating;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great audio quality even with headphones, volume remains high;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 12MP camera has a refined interface; the image quality is among the best though photos can look overprocessed if you zoom in; very good selfie camera;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K videos are packed with detail; 1080p @ 60fps videos are smooth, AF issues from the S7 edge have been ironed out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Some say you shouldn't buy the first generation of anything - cars, TVs, gadgets - as the factories that make them are still warming up. The "facelift" version will probably iron out any issues that slipped by in Gen 1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note7 is that facelift - it's a Galaxy S7, but with the rough edges sanded down, new ideas implemented. Not just that, it's the premium version too, adding features that the Galaxy S line will not see until the S8 comes along (the iris scanner and USB Type-C).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even that is a limited way of looking at the Note7 - the S Pen is key to the overall user experience, and it has no alternative in the phone segment. You have to look at a Microsoft Surface Pro or an Apple iPad Pro to get a similar stylus experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung initially used an asymmetric design - a flat screen with a curved back or a curved screen with a flat back. With the Galaxy Note7, symmetry rules and we are happy with the result - the phone both looks and feels better. Here's what else we managed to find out about the Note7, while we worked on this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No phone manufacturer has a proper direct competitor for the Samsung Galaxy Note7. Apple dipped its toes into styluses, but that's only on one iPad, and there's no indication that the iPhone Pro will support a stylus. Other mainstream makers have no answer either - not LG, not HTC, not Sony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So put away the stylus. The Moto Z has a beautiful AMOLED screen - 5.5" QHD - and we can live with it being flat. It's metal build is super thin (5.2mm!) and you get proper Snapdragon 820 performance. The 13MP camera features OIS and f/1.8 aperture; the 5MP front camera comes with big pixels. The battery is kind of small, though, 2,600mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force (so far US exclusive), has a 3,500mAh battery (matching the Note7) in just 7mm of thickness. It also upgrades the main camera to 21MP (keeping the OIS and f/1.8 specs). Both phones are modular, but we're waiting to see if the concept would take off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the US is getting the Note7 first, let's look at another phone that launched there recently. The ZTE Axon 7 also has a flat 5.5" AMOLED screen with QHD resolution. It measures up quite well to the Note7 - Snapdragon 820 chipset, 20MP camera with OIS and f/1.8 lens, 3,250mAh battery, stereo speakers too. The Axon 7 is also available in China with 128GB storage (similar situation to the Note7, the US is getting 64GB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe does have a 128GB option, but that's merely the middle child. The top specced model comes with 256GB (and a microSD slot) plus 6GB of RAM. Both are hooked up to a Snapdragon 820 chipset driving a 5.7" Super AMOLED display (with only 1080p resolution, though). The main camera features a 23MP sensor, OIS and f/2.0 lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has the P9 Plus - an upscaled version of the P9 with a 5.5" Super AMOLED screen (1080p) and Kirin 955. The Plus model has the trademark dual 12MP camera setup - one in full color and one in Black &amp; White (with Leica branding and camera software). It has a 3,400mAh battery in its 7mm thick body (for comparison, the Note7 is 7.9mm thick).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the upcoming Huawei Honor Note 8. A real beast with its 6.6" Super AMOLED screen (proper QHD resolution this time too) and big 4,500mAh battery. The camera is one-eyed this time, a 13MP shooter with OIS, but the phone still uses the same Kirin 955 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OnePlus 3 launched to much fanfare and positive reviews and is one of the cheapest phones on this list, yet it offers the same features. 5.5" 1080p AMOLED (by Samsung) - check. 16MP camera with OIS - check. Snapdragon 820 chipset - check. It doesn't have a microSD slot (and the only storage option is 64GB), but it runs a mostly pure Android version and it has 6GB of RAM - more than most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we go into slightly more exotic solutions like the vivo Xplay5 Elite. It has the smallest screen here - 5.43" - but it is a dual-curved Super AMOLED with QHD resolution. Inside is a Snapdragon 820 nestled next to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (there's no microSD slot, but we don't think it matters). The main camera is similar to the OnePlus - 16MP with OIS and f/2.0 aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reality, however, is that neither of these phones has proper waterproofing (the Moto Zs are water resistant but not proof) or things like an iris scanner or a stylus, or even fast wireless charging. There's just no single phone that combines all the features that the Samsung's flagship has managed to pile up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So we have no doubt that Samsung has a winner on its hands with the Galaxy Note7. We do wonder, though, will it be gamers or business users that end up buying the most Note7s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VR is beginning to crack the consumer market and Samsung's solution is both one of the most affordable and one of the most popular ones (it helps that Gear VRs are handed out for free with each Galaxy flagship in the beginning).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Secure folder is unmatched in the way it creates a completely separate area in the phone - it's like apps live on a completely different phone. And the gate is locked by iris and fingerprint scanners. The new S Pen features and their interactions with the Always On screen will quickly work their way into your daily routine too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Few devices manage to combine business and pleasure as completely as the Samsung Galaxy Note7 does. We look forward to using it for both in the days ahead while we work on even more in-depth articles about its performance and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note7 is available with two different chipsets - Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 8890. We're covering both with this review.</paragraph>
