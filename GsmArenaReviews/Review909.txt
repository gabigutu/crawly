			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note may have started the phablet craze, but history won't count for much when the Note 3 faces the HTC One Max. The Max takes the lauded HTC One design and build and trumps the Note 3 in terms of screen size. This fight though is about more than sheer size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we compared the Galaxy S4 vs. HTC One we noted that the looks and build quality of the One are miles ahead of the Galaxy S4, while Samsung balanced that out with better specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the phablet playground, both companies worked on areas, which needed improvement - it's the HTC that has the bigger screen this time around, but the Galaxy Note 3 caught up in terms of looks. In case you're not closely familiar with the specs of the two phablets, here's a quick recap of where each device bests the other.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 over One Max<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll break down these advantages and cover them in more detail later on, but one thing is clear from the get go. The HTC One Max is basically an enlarged One, while the Galaxy Note 3 is a device from a separate line and has a number of significant advantages over its Galaxy S4 sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC did improve a bit on the basic One design with a fingerprint sensor and a microSD card slot, but the camera OIS got lost along the way. Is that enough to stop Samsung's freight train of features?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll know for sure when all the rounds of this heavyweight boxing match are over and the hits are counted. It all starts with design and handling - jump over the next page to see if the big-boned beauty with pedigree can score the first hit against the leather-bound late bloomer.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Beauty is subjective but rulers are not and they'll tell you the HTC One Max is bigger than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in every dimension. The exact numbers are 164.5 x 82.5 x 10.3mm for the One Max and 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3mm for the Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Width and thickness are more important for the in-hand feel than length One Max, and the Note 3 fares better in both of them. 3.3mm wider and 2mm slimmer may not sound like much on paper, but in reality they make up for a tangible difference. While the curved back of the Max sits nicely in the hand, it does nothing to make the device feel compact. The extra height (which comes mostly from the two BoomSound speakers) makes the device top heavy, too, which is not helping much either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of weight, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is fairly light for its size - 168g - but doesn't feel hollow. The HTC One Max is almost 50g heavier at 217g and it's a difference you can feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aluminum is the calling card of the One family - other Androids go for either glass or plastic, but that premium raw metal feel is reserved only for HTC's flagships in the three size categories (mini, regular, max) unless you want to go with an iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One Max feels solid, but we have to say we're not enamored with the release mechanism of the back cover. We'll get back to what it actually covers later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has gone all in with plastic but thanks to some impressive engineering, the end result is the best plastic finish, Nokia's polycarbonate creations included. The back has a convincing leather feel, while the chrome-imitating sides are a nice accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You won't hear this often, but the Galaxy Note 3 looks compact, at least next to the HTC One. Thankfully, HTC has moved the power button from the top to the right so that you can actually reach it with your fingers - even on the HTC One that was a bit of a stretch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the layout of controls on the HTC One Max is unchanged - volume rocker on the right, capacitive Back and Home keys below the screen (and no app switcher key) and then there's the new fingerprint sensor on the back. It's positioned so that your index finger naturally lays there when you hold the device (the same argument as the volume rocker and power key on the LG G2). You have to swipe your finger over the sensor to activate it, but be careful not to smudge the camera in the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 follows the standard Galaxy arrangement - volume rocker on the left, power button on the right, capacitive Back and Menu keys flanking a hardware Home key. There's no fingerprint sensor, but you can get some extra security if you use the Galaxy Gear - the phablet will lock if the watch (on your wrist) is too far away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is a unique kind of control, but it's one of the most important ones - unlike on the pervious Notes, this one works with the capacitive Back and Menu keys so you can use it to control the device without ever laying a finger on the screen. That has a number of advantages, which we'll get back to in the software chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're on it, we should mention that both devices have an IR blaster on top so they can control home equipment. The difference is that the One Max can also learn codes so you can teach it commands or use equipment not in its database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up a home theater that you can control solely with the HTC One Max, but the phablet itself is a pretty good media player. The large, bright screen and the front-facing stereo speakers make for an experience that's hard to match at a sub-tablet level. The optional BoomBass speaker adds substance to the sound and serves as a nice stand for the device too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 may not have audio superiority, but it wins when it comes to PC connectivity. It is the first pocketable device that supports USB 3.0 and the good thing is that it's backwards compatible with USB 2.0, so you can still use your old chargers and cables. USB 3.0 gives data transfer a good speed boost, which may be important if you move a lot of data to and from the Note 3 (those 2160p videos get big very fast).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phablets have removable back covers and under them you'll find a microSIM card and a microSD card slots. The difference is that the Galaxy Note 3 gives you access to its 3,200mAh battery so you can swap it for extra-long usage or when it starts giving up on you . The One Max's 3,300mAh battery is sealed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. It's more compact and lighter, which helps the ergonomics and portability greatly. The build quality is very competitive against HTC and the removable battery is a nice plus too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max is a large and heavy device, its aluminum looks can't save it from this. Also, there's no good reason to seal the battery when the cover is already removable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are both built around large displays, but the Max comes out on top in terms of sheer size. Both have 1080p resolution and tack-sharp densities of 373ppi and 386ppi respectively (though at this point those are just numbers, there's no perceivable difference in sharpness).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between a 5.9" screen and 5.7" screen (both with 16:9 aspects) is around 7%. Since both phones have hardware keys rather than on-screen ones, all of the screen real estate is used for content and that 7% does make a difference (unlike the 5.2" LG G2 vs. 5" phones like the Galaxy S4). It's a small difference though, considering the overall size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both displays have spectacular image quality - contrast is amazing even on the LCD screen of the One Max, colors look beautiful and viewing angles are very wide. AMOLEDs get bad rep for their extra saturation, but the Galaxy Note 3's screen modes allow it to achieve perfect sRGB (or keep the extra saturation if you prefer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One area where the HTC One Max screen has a clear advantage is brightness - it goes up to 629nits, which is impressive considering the relatively low black levels (which means excellent contrast too). The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 maxes out at about half that, 379nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the extra brightness, the reflectivity of the One Max screen works against it in direct sunlight and the phablet has only average sunlight legibility, while the Galaxy Note 3 screen is among the best we've seen in this category.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 screen has a couple of hidden extras - the digitizer that allows it to work with the S Pen and the regular capacitive digitizer that can detect fingers from a distance or through gloves (great for winter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The HTC One Max has size and raw brightness going for it, but doesn't do too well in the sun. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3, wins on the sunlight legibility test and thanks to its color profiles gives you the best of both worlds (either extra punchy or very accurate colors). The high sensitivity is also worth a point for the Galaxy Note 3, helping it even the scores here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max has a 3,300mAh Li-Po battery, which is sealed inside the phablet's body. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a user-replaceable battery but it's a Li-Ion unit of slightly lower 3,200mAh capacity. Then there's a difference in chipsets - Snapdragon 800 vs. 600 - and more crucially display tech. LCDs and AMOLEDs have strong and weak points in the various tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one, the call test, is decided by modem efficiency as the chipset and screen do virtually nothing. Here the HTC One Max lasted a little over 22 hours on a single charge, an impressive 4 hours more than the Galaxy Note 3. That's more than the 100mAh difference can explain, meaning more efficient modem on the One Max.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser test is particularly stressful for the devices and, once again, the HTC One Max has a significant advantage over the Galaxy Note 3. The One Max scored over 11 hours, which is close to the best we've seen, while the Note 3 time is solid but still two hours less than the its rival managed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is the one area where the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 outlasts the HTC One Max, but only by 20 minutes. Both phablets posted impressive times of over 13 hours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With wins in two out of three tests and low standby power draw, the HTC One Max scores a highly impressive overall rating of 81 hours. If used moderately, the phablet will easily last you three days and it's all but impossible to kill its battery in one day, even if you stress it real hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3's rating is very good too, at 75 hours. However, in virtually any task or use scenario, it will run out of juice a couple of hours before the One Max does. Yes, you can carry a spare battery to double the battery life, but few people do that. Maybe in a few years changing the battery for a fresh one will help the Note 3 outlast an old One Max, but not today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One Max. Phablets are expected to have great battery lives and the One Max did splendidly here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 you can still get three days of moderate usage, but heavy users will run out of juice a few hours sooner than their One Max-wielding collegues.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 both run Android 4.3, each skinned by the latest versions of two of the most popular custom skins available. We've covered them in detail before, but here are a couple of videos to refresh your memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the lockscreen, the One Max has a rare option in the Android world - fingerprint unlock. This is marginally faster and more secure than, say, a swipe lock and you can assign an app to be launched with a certain finger. Unfortunately, reaching the sensor with anything than the index finger is difficult on a phablet of this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Android 4.3 and Sense 5.5, you can add multiple widgets as you do in stock Android. There are also 4 shortcuts you can use to launch common apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 lacks the shortcuts and widgets by default, but you can enable those options in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been updated to match stock Android on the One Max. This means you get notifications, but there are also quick toggles. You could pull down the shade with two fingers instead, to get straight to the toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3's notification area is more customized and has a line of quick toggles always in sight, but you can use the two-finger swipe to expand the toggles too. There's a line with a brightness slider and an Auto checkbox, which can be disabled to save space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens have been tweaked too. The Sense UI brings BlinkFeed to the One Max. It creates a stream of posts from your social networks (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) along with news and stories from a long list of providers, in areas of interest you've set. The BlinkFeed can be disabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy Note 3, Samsung has created a similar feature called My Magazine that's accessible by swiping up on the homescreen or hitting the Home key. It's split into Social (Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, 500px, but no Facebook or Instagram), News (you can pick topics here too) and Personal (shows your photos, music, calendar events, messages and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switchers have been customized too - the HTC One Max shows a 3 x 3 grid of app thumbnails, while the (almost) standard switcher of the Note 3 fits only 4 thumbnails. On both you can dismiss apps you don't need any more with a swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has two major advantages here. The Multi Window option splits the large screen into two so you can use two apps simultaneously, even two browsers windows (this is something we do on a desktop on occasion, but has been impossible on a mobile device until now). Not all apps support Multi Window, but some apps in the Play Store have already enabled it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another way to make good use of the large screen and powerful chipset - both of which beg for such multitasking options - is to use the S Pen. You can use it to draw a rectangle and put one of several mini apps in there (Browser, Hangouts, ChatOn, YouTube and a few more). Those can be minimized to a small circle. You can run multiple instances of those too, not just one or two like on most floating app implementations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This option is great - it takes the Chat Heads of Facebook Home and extends it to apps. This way you can have a minimized app, say, Hangouts, tap it to reply to a message and minimize the app again with great ease. This is the closest we've come to the speed and efficiency of desktop computing on a pocketable device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is also great for searching - the search app can filter items by tags, date or creation, and type (e.g. notes, images, music), which is a very handy and orderly way to sift through thousands of items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 also has the motion gestures we saw on the Galaxy S4 - waving to move between photos or scroll webpages, scroll webpages with your gaze, pause videos automatically when you look away and so on. They might be a little gimmicky, but are nice to have anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max has an interesting option in the phone's app drawer, borrowed from Windows Phone 8. It's called Kid mode and it is actually an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to. To enable Kid mode the first time around, you need to sign up via email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other cool option is Do Not Disturb, which can mute incoming calls and alerts (including the LED notification light) except ones from your favorite contacts. You can set the DND mode to time out automatically but there's no option to automatically turn it on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The multitasking options alone secure the win for the Note 3 here, but the easy S Pen search, gestures and customization options have their say too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is an interesting option, but the Note 3 has an answer for it. The fingerprint sensor is nice, but its software backing is not good enough to push the HTC One Max on top.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This should be fairly straightforward - on paper the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 just has more of everything than the HTC One Max so it should score an easy victory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 3 we're testing is powered by a Snapdragon 800 chipset, which has four Krait 400 CPU cores clocked at 2.26GHz, 3GB of RAM and the new Adreno 330 GPU. The HTC One Max has to rely on older CPU and GPU configurations - quad-core Krait 300 @ 1.7GHz and Adreno 320 - and it has "only" 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 is indeed a beast in terms of CPU performance and it topped all three benchmarks we use - Benchmark Pi for single-threaded performance, Linpack and Geekbench 3 for multithreaded performance. The HTC One Max scores a little better than the HTC One, but that just brings it close to Galaxy S4 levels, the Note 3 is well out of reach.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Integrated benchmarks Quadrant and AnTuTu also put the Galaxy Note 3 well ahead of the One Max. In the case of Quadrant, the Note 3 has almost double the One Max score. The One Max is on par with the One in both benchmarks, while the Note 3 beats its Galaxy S4 sibling by a comfortable margin.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phablets have 1080p screens, so both GLBenchmark scores practically run at native resolution. In those two benchmarks, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 topped the charts and posted 70%-80% better framerates than the HTC One Max. The gap is less prominent in Epic Citadel (around 30%-40%) but surprisingly both phablets do worse than Sony's flagship Xperias and the GL G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to web browsing benchmarks, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is not the ultimate champion (the Apple iPhone 5s tops it), but both SunSpider (JavaScript performance) and BrowserMark 2 (HTML5 speed) give the Note 3 a massive advantage. Vellamo was more conservative and puts the HTC One Max pretty close to the Note 3.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. A newer chipset and more RAM make this a very one-sided fight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC did not update the processing power compared to the HTC One, so the One Max lags behind even the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones come loaded to the teeth with apps out of the box, but all apps aren't born equal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take the music player for example - the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 packs equalizers, SoundAlive, Smart Sound (equalizes volume between tracks), Adapt Sound (tunes the EQ automatically to your headset) and FLAC support (16 and 24 bit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max lost the BeatsAudio setting, but HTC didn't replace it with a proper equalizer. Sure the One Max has the better speakers, but most people use headphones for music - in the next chapter we'll see if HTC has kept the quality audio hardware. The player supports FLAC files (16 and 24 bit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the One Max has FM Radio, which is still an important feature to some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 video player handled every codec and container we threw at it, while making good use of the advanced sound options. It has the Pop Up play option too. The HTC One Max has limited codec support, so you'll have to rely on third party apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're on the topic of multimedia, we should note that both devices can output video over DLNA and MHL. The Note 3 supports MHL2, while the One Max uses the original MHL standard. The major difference between the two is in the kind of adapter required. Some TVs support MHL without adaptors, so you should check if yours supports MHL or MHL2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phablets have IR blasters too, to control TVs, set top boxes, DVD and Blu-Ray players and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max has the edge here as its IR blaster can learn control codes from existing remotes, while the Note 3 cannot. This means you can control practically anything that uses an IR remote, even if it's not in the app's database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One Max also comes with an Office document editor, while the Galaxy Note 3 is bundled with just a viewer. This seems like a major omission on such a business-centric device - after all Samsung crowed left and right about how awesome the KNOX enterprise security feature is, but what good it is when you can't edit the Word file you just received?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with a capable file browser, which the HTC One Max does not have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max (like other HTCs) comes with a handy app that will transfer your contacts, along with other kinds of data stored on your old phone - Android 2.3+, iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and even some feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phablets have custom note taking apps - Scribble on the HTC One Max and S Note/Scrapbooker on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which can sync with Evernote. The Note 3 does have the S Pen, which makes taking notes significantly easier. HTC has an aluminum capacitive stylus for the One Max, but that's round and easy to lose, especially since you can't sheath it into the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also has several apps that might have limited application but seem fun nonetheless. You can line up several Galaxy devices and play music on their speakers simultaneously or connect several Note 3s into one large display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Health app is a great exercise tracker too - it uses the phablet's own sensors but can also connect to external devices like scales for a more complete picture of your health and progress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Both phablets have something the other doesn't and while the Galaxy Note 3 has more apps, some of them are fairly limited. No document editor is a big deal (those are usually pricy), while no file browser is not bad. Plus the remote control app on the HTC One Max is pretty nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 3 has an equalizer and better codec support, but no FM radio. S Health is nice, but some may find the data transfer app on the One Max better (who's going to run with a phablet?).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The fact that HTC One Max lacks a Beats audio label got quite a few people worried that it might not be able to match the audio output of its One sibling. As it turns out there was nothing to worry about, as the HTC phablet was easily able to take this round.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 delivers perfectly clean output, it can't quite match its rival in two key aspects - volume levels and stereo quality with headphones on. The differences aren't too huge and probably won't matter to many of you, but they are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One Max. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 delivers impressive audio output, but it just can't match the One Max, which is among the best audio players we have ever seen. </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still camera features and image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max uses the company's UltraPixel camera but just as any device with it other than the HTC One, it lacks optical image stabilization (OIS). The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 packs a 13MP shooter with no OIS either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the past we've seen that in good lighting conditions the large pixels of the UltraPixel camera make little difference (even the OIS of the HTC One as shutter speeds are very fast). So the three-fold resolution advantage of the Galaxy Note 3 should give it a massive advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get to that, we should mention that the HTC One Max does have an advantage in field of view (FoV). The Note 3 (like the Galaxy S4) doesn't have the widest camera around, so the One Max photos are noticeably wider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the wide FoV brings a penalty to fine detail as fewer pixels are available for a specific part of the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even with that in mind, the difference between the Galaxy Note 3 photos and One Max photos is huge. We upscaled One Max photos to match the resolution of the Note 3 to highlight the difference in captured detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4MP resolution of the HTC One Max camera just isn't enough for fine detail like the tiles on the roof, the foliage and the small print on the sign. Even the relatively large fire escape staircase is a blur. You can also see that there's noise in the sky and in the shadows, which further brings the amount of resolved detail down. The point of large pixels is that they are worth several small pixels, but noise really gets in the way of that. You can also see oversharpening halos and traces of purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a clear advantage here. The dynamic range of its camera is slightly wider, we'll see that more clearly in the HDR tests. But the Note 3 also has advantages that don't relate to resolution - its color rendering is more accurate than that of the One Max. Both go for a warm white balance, but the Max goes a bit too far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even when we try to downscale the Galaxy Note 3 photos to the resolution of the One Max camera, the Note 3 keeps its advantage. You can still see more fine detail in the tiles, foliage and small print in the Galaxy Note 3 images. The downscaling also brings down the noise and hides the oversharpening halo of the Note 3 photos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung also handles the sun reflecting off the glass building better, without providing any less detail in the shade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But don't just take our word for it - here go the full resolution samples so you can do your own comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the HDR modes of both phablets. With the sun so low in the sky (as it is this time of year) it can be quite hard to get a good shot without HDR - either the sun shines directly into the lens or it reflects too much of neighboring buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the crop below, the thin metal skeleton of the crane starts to get lost in the glare in the HTC One Max photos. Flipping the HDR switch actually makes the matter worse - HDR on the One Max is not good at highlights. It does improve shadows, but it goes overboard for our tastes - too much dynamic brings contrast down and makes images look unrealistic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 does a better job of rendering the crane without HDR and with the mode enabled it actually starts to bring it some of the clouds. The shadows are improved a bit but not much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we tried was Sweep panorama. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 produces huge panoramas with a whopping 60MP resolution and tons of detail and is quite wide - wider than 360°. Stitching artifacts are rare unless there are moving objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max manages 13MP resolution, but the panorama isn't as wide and there are more stitching artifacts visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of panoramas, the Galaxy Note 3 can shoot spherical panoramas too (identical to Photo Spheres and Google Street View).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max does have Zoe, a special mode that captures several full-resolution shots along with 3 seconds of video. Later these images and video can be used for some editing (e.g. object removal) and are automatically stitched into "highlights" - clips that show off your photos of a specific event (automatically grouped by time and location).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has no Zoe alternative, but has more options as a whole. It can capture audio to go with the photo, create animated GIFs plus some clever extras buried in the settings (e.g. using another device as a remote viewfinder).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. We didn't expect anything different really - the UltraPixel camera strength lies in low-light shots. In good lighting conditions the Galaxy Note 3 is one of the better cameras as we saw in our 6-way camera shootout. Also, it does better HDR and panorama and has more fun features to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max produces decent photos to show on your HDTV or post on Facebook, but cameraphone fans will find plenty of faults with it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the HTC One Max and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can record 1080p @ 30fps videos - the gold standard. The One Max throws in 720p @ 60fps but the Galaxy Note 3 tops it easily with 1080p @ 60fps, not to mention that it's one of the first phones that can record 2160p @ 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max records 1080p @ 30fps videos at a very good 21Mbps bitrate with 192Kbps audio bitrate (48kHz sampling rate). The Galaxy Note 3 uses lower bitrates on both counts - 17Mbps total bitrate and 128kBps audio rate (48kHz). Both devices record stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max camera once again has the wider FoV, which again works a little bit against it when it comes to fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results are strongly in favor of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Even in the 1080p @ 30fps mode, the Note 3 manages to capture more detail than the One Max whose videos look too soft for FullHD. Then, of course, the Note 3 pulls the 2160p ace and completely trumps the One Max's video quality. Note that bitrate climbs up to almost 50Mbps, so 2160p videos can eat up your storage pretty quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it's worth it - 2160p is 3840 x 2160, while the resolution of the One Max for stills is 2688 x 1520. That means you can grab a frame from a 2160p video and have double the resolution of an HTC One Max photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering on either isn't particularly accurate, but the Note 3 has a slight advantage. The One Max also overexposes the shot, perhaps due to the narrower dynamic range we saw in the still camera. We do have one criticism for the Galaxy Note 3 and it's that the continuous autofocus triggered a bit too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has one very impressive feature - 4x zoom in 1080p mode. It's almost as good as that of the Nokia Lumia 1020 despite the Galaxy's sensor not having nearly as many pixels. Here's a video demo of the zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have High Framerate (HFR) modes, but the Galaxy Note 3 does it at 1080p resolution, while the One Max has to drop to 720p. An odd thing we noticed is that the 720p @ 60fps videos from the One Max have a wider FoV than the 1080p @ 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously the quality drops when you enable HFR. In the Note 3 videos you can see less detail and noticeable aliasing. Still, we kept the 1080p @ 30fps crops from the HTC One Max to see how it stacks up against the Note 3's 1080p @ 60fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max manages to resolve even less detail than before in no small part due to the lower resolution, but the end result just isn't a very good 720p clip. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 quality has dropped compared to its 30fps mode, but it still retains more fine detail than HTC One Max's 1080 @ 30fps video, which is pretty impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Galaxy phablet convincingly beat its opponent in every test here. Add the higher-resolution HFR video plus great video zoom and you get one of the best camcorders around, in daylight at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max video recording prowess is just no match for the Note 3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Low-light imaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max has been waiting for this test. With larger pixels and wider aperture - f/2.0 vs. f/2.2 - it should have a noticeable advantage even without the help of OIS. We'll start off with still photography - we took several photos with each and picked out the best and the worst.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the flash off, the HTC One Max manages to catch up to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in terms of resolved detail, it even has a slight edge. Its white balance isn't quite as accurate (the wall behind the mouse is white), but it is more reliable as its worst shot is noticeably better than the worst Note 3 photo. The lack of OIS hurts the One Max though, the worst HTC One shot would have suffered less from handshake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution photos for your viewing pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We enabled the flash and took a few more photos. The HTC One Max flash is weaker than that on the Galaxy Note 3, but with it the white balance improved, the amount of detail went up and the One Max became more reliable with practically no difference between its best and worst shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 recuperates a bit from the less than stellar showing in the previous test and its reliability went up as well (though the worst shot is still noticeably softer). The higher resolution of the Note 3 allows it to capture a bit more detail than the One Max here, but the difference is quite minor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the full resolution shots for this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advantage of the HTC One Max in low-light carries over when it comes to shooting videos and in this case it's even more pronounced. Note that these videos were shot on a tripod with no light (not even the LEDs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One Max videos are a bit dark but capture detail like the texture in the "sky" behind the Ferris wheel, the wooden planks behind the sign and the grass. This detail is completely lost on the Galaxy Note 3 in both 1080p and 2160p modes. In the dark, there's no benefit of shooting 2160p with the Note 3 - it wastes space without adding more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max even manages to pull off more accurate color rendering and better contrast - the Note 3 videos have low contrast and poor colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One Max. This would have been a more definitive win with OIS, but the One Max still proved more reliable for stills and captured noticeably better video in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low-light imaging just isn't Samsung Galaxy Note 3's forte and its stronger flash wasn't enough to save the day here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two phablet titans were built by established electronics companies with very different development cultures. Samsung has found its place with the "throw everything at the wall" approach, while HTC is more restrained when it comes to adding new features, but is more willing to go off the beaten path.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the HTC One Max disappointed slightly as it is a bigger HTC One - we expected the extra size to allow for some upgrades, but all we got is a microSD card reader and a fingerprint sensor (losing the camera OIS along the way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the One Max is clearly angling towards the multimedia crowd - quality audio hardware and speakers mean more than a better music app out of the box. Audiophiles are very picky about the apps they use so chances are they wouldn't have stuck with the default audio player even if it did have an equalizer. Same goes for the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more capable IR remote control app is another plus as is the amazing battery life. Performance is not cutting edge, but Snapdragon 600 still has plenty of bite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One Max</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max is also suitable for an older and perhaps less tech-savvy crowd - the data transfer from the old device is done through a simple wizard, Kid mode prevents any accidents when you're using the phablet to keep the children occupied and having a document editor instead of a file browser is good too. Some people don't care about the file system as each app handles its own file types, but having to install an app just to edit Word files doesn't sound ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photography is the one spot where the One Max lagged noticeably behind, but if all you do is post on Facebook the difference is reduced significantly. Plus, those Zoe Highlights videos are very cool and take zero effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also rather big for a pocketable device and while that has been said for every phablet yet, the size and weight will be a deal-breaker for a sizable group of potential buyers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 packs such a heap of buzzwords that anyone but a power user risks getting lost. You don't have to use all features though and the Note 3 comes with almost anything you need out of the box (save for the Office document editor).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is amazing for note taking and many of you you will find themselves using it all the time. The multitasking options are the best we've seen too, the Galaxy Note 3 is a perfect post-PC device that can really boost your usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With KNOX Samsung is clearly targeting the business crowd, many of whom probably had a PocketPC in the heyday of the stylus. But again, the S Pen is in a different galaxy compared to a regular stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 800 chipset, 3GB RAM, LTE-Advanced and even the USB 3.0 port future-proof the device and Samsung has a pretty good track record when it comes to updating its flagship devices (even if the company takes its sweet time on occasion). Plus, you can swap out the battery when it gets old and add more storage on the cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 excels in video capture with the unprecedented 2160p recording and the best 1080p @ 60fps recording we have seen so far. Even though low-light performance is not great, daylight photos turn out very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One Max snagged the audio quality title, but Adapt Sound and other features of the Samsung music player will help you squeeze out the best of your headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is also more compact than the HTC, so some of those who are scared off by the sheer size of the One Max might find the Note 3 to be in the sweet spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the time to bring up price - both the HTC One Max and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are priced the same, or will be soon enough in the places they are not. Keep in mind that this is for a 16GB One Max and 32GB Note 3, but since both have microSD cards it's not such a huge deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price difference seems steeper when you consider that with the HTC One Max you're getting the older chipset and the camera from the One Mini. Neither of those things are necessarily show-stoppers, but it's hard to shake the feeling that you're just getting merely an upscaled HTC One rather than a proper powerhouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has plenty more to offer to a consumer than the Galaxy S4, so its price premium is well justified. Just make sure you're not getting the Exynos version - that one lacks LTE and 2160p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, both phablets seem to target slightly different groups of consumers so they might find a way to co-exist peacefully. But there is some overlap in target consumers and the more advanced, compact hardware of the Note 3 will bring them to Samsung's door.</paragraph>
