			<paragraph>A clamshell with quite simple but original design, sufficient choice of functions and an integrated VGA camera - that's the new Siemens CFX65, now coming up with a loop antenna integrated into a massive hanger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens takes entering the field of flip phones really seriously. After introducing the basic model CF62, which soon became very popular, Siemens comes with the new CFX65 flip phone. It is one class higher from its predecessor and will surely attract new customers with its quality address book, VGA camera, eye-catching chameleon effect and low weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Several official pictures of CFX65 </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Another clamshell with a loop antenna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is decided in two color variants - ivory or classic silver. We had the silver model with blue complements. Covers aren't replaceable so it won't be possible to change the look of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens CFX65 represents a silver box sized 97 x 48 x 23 mm. The phone isn't among the smallest clamshells but weight of 88 grams is quite agreeable. Its untraditionally designed loop antenna will surely capture fans. In my opinion this solution is much more elegant than the antenna, which is rising up from the phone. Furthermore it can be used as a hanger for a strap to wear the phone on your neck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The phone will not attract everyone at first glimpse</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another striking design feature is the blue stilliform area on the top, which defines the outer display area. The light blue color is changing to richly violet shade if you look at it from a different angle. The producer's logo is also situated within. This color surface is bordered by a chrome frame, in the bottom of which a camera lens and a diode are placed. The diode will be certainly more useful than the standard mirror for self-portraits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Massive hanger or antenna ? an integrated camera and a torch </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the phone look like silver, but you can see at first sight that it's made of plastic, which spoils the overall impression. The combination of silver, light blue and shiny chrome seems a bit slushy and reminds me of a toy. That's basically applies to every stylish phone; some people like it and some don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some will like it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back part is spared of designer's eccentricity. The battery cover, which is decorated with a piece of a stilliform, occupies the bigger part. We can also find a round grid of a loud speaker there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Back part is decorated just by a soft press piece and a round grid of the loud speaker. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side lines are modest in a German way. There are no waves or striking curves as it is with Asian phones. On the left side we can find buttons for turning up and down the volume during calls. By longer press these buttons start the camera or the lighting diodes. The functions are respectively indicated with symbols. On the right side there is only the small window of the infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Silver rocket switch button on the left side ? and an infrared port window on the right</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A classic Siemens system connector is placed traditionally in the bottom edge. There is also a mini aperture with a microphone. The loop antenna is dominating the top part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction of the phone, including the hinge, is solid and creaks only on a firm clasp. The back battery cover is also strongly attached. It covers a Li-Ion battery with capacity of 600 mAh, which should last up to 200 hours in standby mode and 200 minutes of speech. This is not much, but quite good for a clamshell.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Style is hidden inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you were thinking that there is no reason to classify this phone among the stylish phones, I am sure that you'll change your mind after opening it. Inside, only the area around the edges is made of the silver like plastic. The bigger part of the phone is decided in the same light blue changeable color supplemented with chrome details. This combination is suitable for the phone and I think women will especially enjoy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   In opened position the Siemens CFX65 flip phone looks much better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is embedded in the blue area. The producer's logo is placed above the display and the phone type sign stands below. The earphone is traditionally covered by a metallic grid. A wide shiny frame borders the entire area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Metallic grid of an earphone and a hinge detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is completely flat in the bottom part. Again a wide shiny frame borders it. The functional and the alphanumeric part of the keypad are joined together in one unit. Outer keys are decided in blue color whilst inner keys are silver. The chrome dividing lines between these colorfully distinguished parts are very impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Demonstration of how the color changes from light blue to violet </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main 4-way key with a confirmation button in the middle is also optically highlighted. Moving it in all directions and the confirmation is steady. I experienced small difficulties by pressing the context keys, which are located right on the top and used for confirmation of the functions displayed in the status row on the display. These keys are quite narrow and pressing them is a bit problematic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad is completely flat </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys are very well separated - horizontally due to the dividing lines and vertically thanks to the sharp edges. The keys are slightly bulging. This is not recognizable at sight but your finger will notice it. Keypad illumination is blue and striking. Keys legends and space between them are also illuminated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad illumination is blue, strong enough and even </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The inner display is sized 28 x 35 mm and can display up to 65K colors. Its resolution is good (128 x 160 pixels) and is assuring quality. Unfortunately passive (STN) technology is used, which degrades display quality with a very long inertia. This makes fast moving through the menu very difficult. The phone is not a sprinter itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Inner display is big enough, but should be bigger for there's enough space ? Outer display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outer display is monochrome only. It shows a digital clock, the name of your GSM provider and a status row, where you can find signal and battery strength indicator. The size of the outer display is 20 x 14 mm with 96 x 64 pixel resolution. Its illumination is cr?me white and it supplements a design of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Outer display shows the basic information ? Missed calls or incoming messages appear on the provider's name place</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Environment and control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you've already had experience with some of the new Siemens phones, I am sure that you won't get lost in the CFX65 menu. It's very clear. On the main display in emergency mode you'll see a status row showing signal and battery strength indicators. Also you'll find there information about date and time, provider's name and a bottom status row with the context keys functions. Of course you can set a wallpaper of your choice in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access the main menu by pressing the confirmation button. You'll see a matrix of nine icons, which get larger and animated by clicking them. Those of you, who are not comfortable with that, can view the menu in large and individual icons. The deeper levels of the menu are in text form only. The colors of the menu can be changed in different schemes. In the testing phone there weren't any of them available but we assume that the phones for sale will be better equipped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Display in standby mode ? main menu in the matrix ? ? the icon view ? display settings possibilities -color schemes are also available</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Faster browsing the menu is possible. There are three options for quick menu selection - by pressing a number (all menu functions are numbered internally), by easily accessible list of the most used functions or by speed selection. Speed selection means assignment of a function or a phone number to a key on the numeric keypad. Two favorite functions can be assigned to the context keys. Each direction of the navigation key has also a function assigned, but it cannot be changed. The right direction will get you to the received messages. The left direction is assigned to the camera. The way up leads you to profiles and down direction goes to the address book. For moving in the menu you can also use the side buttons. In opened position the upper button starts profiles and a longer press activates the camera. The lower button does nothing on a short press and on a longer press it activates the voice recorder. In closed position the upper button turns on the outer display, the lower button activates the lighting diode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and address book<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the previous chapter I have described the functions of the side buttons and I am going to continue in this chapter. During telephony the side buttons are used for call volume control. The sound is clear and the volume seems to be sufficient. You can also turn on the handsfree but if you are holding the phone in your hand, it won't be really loud. That's because the sound is coming out from the back loud speaker. The upper side button is used to reject a call during ringing. I would appreciate if the lower button could silence ringing during incoming call. You can do that by pressing the "?" key when your phone is opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Dialing a number and calling</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone rings in 40 channels melodies. The playback quality is not reaching the quality of the Asian competitors but it's sufficient. The ringing volume can be changed easily by using the profiles. There are seven of them available, the eighth one is designated for Airplane mode, which turn's off sound including alarms. It's not possible to change ringing melodies in profiles, just the volume. There is also a possibility to activate vibrating alert, illumination intensity or calls filtering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is dual and because of to the missing 1900 MHz band you can't make calls e.g. in USA with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Multi-item address book where you can search by several initial letters ? a record view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we are used to the Siemens series 65 phones, we will praise the address book. It has not so big capacity as its classic brother CX65 but 250 names should be enough to most of the users. Of course you can search by several initial letters. You can assign up to 14 records to every name with individual surname, and moreover a picture that will be displayed by ringing. Besides four phone numbers and an email address you can save to a name an identification for various instant messaging systems or a postal address. Contacts can be sorted in groups and a specific ringing tone can be assigned to them. Separately from the address book a phonebook is kept where you can find your contacts that are saved on the SIM card.</paragraph>

		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>SMS and multimedia, email receive only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens CFX65 supports text messages, EMS, multimedia messages and partially emails. Thanks to the comfortable keypad message writing could be a fast thing. The speed is not bad, but passive display and response of the phone are slowing it a bit. Most users will be satisfied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During writing an SMS you can see the countdown of characters in the right upper corner and in the middle the number of the message you are currently writing is displayed. T9 dictionary will help you with writing. It's possible to save up to 100 text messages in the phone. The most important messages can be saved in the archive, which is limited only by the amount of free share memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    You can create either text or multimedia messages.. ?? and receive emails</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For creating multimedia messages there is a well arranged editor available. It's possible to create pages and you can send messages up to size of 100 kB. Pictures are displayed right in the editor. The phone features also a simple email client, which can only receive messages via POP3 protocol. You can download either complete messages or just their headers. It does not support attachments.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and other functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the busy users there is a well-arranged calendar where you can enter up to 100 records. It allows selecting from six types of reminders, including a voice record. It's possible to set an alarm and duration length to reminders. Calendar can be in monthly, weekly or daily view. In month view weekends are colorfully highlighted and days with an event are shown in rich orange color. After you select such a day, a list of events appears on two rows under the calendar. The same is with week view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calendar in different views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the list of organizer functions the to-do list can't be left unmentioned. It's possible to enter four types of tasks, assign time, priority and even an alarm to them. There are also simple notes, which can't exceed 160 characters, and an application for computing the world time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calendar possibilities ? complete organizer menu ? application for computing the world time is graphically well done</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Extras category you'll find an alarm clock. It allows recurrence in a selected day, which is the same as with other Siemens phones. There are also a simple calculator, unit converter, stopwatch and a countdown timer. Don't forget the voice recorder, accessible by the side button. There is nothing surprising in the Extras functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Alarm clock, calculator, unit converter and stopwatch? </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of Java games in the phone is limited - there is just one game - but it's possible that it'll be enriched until the start of sell. Anyway, MarbleJam is an interesting logical game, where you sort color balls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Only one game was in the menu of the tested phone ? MarbleJam game</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the list of functions I should mention also the Wap browser version 2.0. With GPRS class 10 you can browse quite fast the Internet. Also you can connect your PC to the Internet, using a data cable or an infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated camera can make pictures in maximal resolution 640 x 480 pixels (VGA). Comparing to other camera phones picture quality is below the average, mainly from the sharpness point of view. It's possible to decrease the resolution in three steps. The lowest resolution is meant for taking pictures used as display background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera viewfinder and settings possibilities</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To improve brightness ratio in the view exposure compensation is used and you can also set a white color balance for inside or outside. 3x digital zoom is available; it works on the principle of crops. If you would like to try creative photography, you can choose some of the classic color effects. You can also try handling with self timer or stylish, animated frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Sample pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lightning diode placed on the front cover, right beside the camera lens, can be used to light up a scene in dusk. However more often it will find its use as an emergency torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The diode will light up the scene </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures and all data, including schemes, messages in the Archive or sound records, are saved in the 4 MB share memory. You can control the memory thanks to the well-arranged manager that is similar to a PC file manager. All the data is saved in different folders as files. It's possible to rename, delete or create new folders. You can also move files between the folders, delete them, etc. Moreover you can take more files at once and send them via infrared port to your PC.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Another women's clamshell?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens CFX65 is a phone, which won't attract everybody. Those of you, who like square shapes and combination of grey, chrome and chameleon blue, will certainly be happy with the phone. The function set is sufficient and I dare to say that most of the people who will enjoy the phone will be female. The phone will be sold since the fourth quarter of this year and we expect a price that will be below the prices of the competitive phones. If we stay with clamshells, the main rivals are Panasonic X400 and Motorola V220.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pros and Cons<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>+ stylish clamshell design + nicely hidden antenna + comfortable keypad  + sophisticated address book + low weight  - plastic look - dualband only - slow passive display - emails can be received only - camera quality below the average</paragraph>
