			<paragraph>The 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona ended in February 16-th after gathering about 50,000 people near the newest technologies and products in the mobile phone industry. The attendance in the first day of the Congress was bigger than the total attendance of last year's 3GSM in Cannes. 1,900 media representatives were near the action and were broadcasting the latest news from the source. 40 % increase was shown in the exhibited companies also, this year they were 962. The 3GSM World Congress will be held again in Barcelona next year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Barcelona<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Barcelona is the capital city of Catalonia region in Spain. The city is located along the Mediterranean coast, south of the Pyrenees. The population of the metropolitan is near 4.6 (the city alone - 1.6) million people. Barcelona is very popular with its football team FC Barcelona and the cultural areas and buildings in the city.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>At the first day of the 3GSM Congress, Sony Ericsson announced their latest additions in phone models. The K610 3G phone and low-end J100.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson booth</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson K610<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The K610 is 102 x 45.2 x 16.9 mm big and weighs 92 grams, thus is one of the smallest 3G bar phones. It has a 262K colors 1.9" TFT display with 176 x 220 pixels resolution. The UMTS/GSM phone also has a 2 megapixel camera, built-in music player, Bluetooth, Memory Stick Micro (M2) slot and USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Sony Ericsson K610</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had the chance to play for a bit with Sony Ericsson K610. The phone is really small for a 3G device and looks and feels great. The dark red menu suits the phone well, but we had trouble to see which is the current selected item. Since the firmware is in beta, there were some things not functioning like they should be, for example the Activity menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main menu - which item is selected?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Adding a new contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The activity menu has a Running apps tab. Not everything is ok with the early firmware</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The player is called Walkman?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a picture with the new phone. Please, note that this is beta firmware, the quality will certainly improve in the final version. Moreover, the lighting conditions inside the Sony Ericsson booth were hard even for our DSLR.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson J100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The J100 is aimed for the everyday use and is not very sophisticated in features. It has a 65K colors on its 96 x 64 pixels STN display. Basic options only are included in this device. SMS, polyphonic melodies, vibration alert, alarm clock, calculator.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W950<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the second day of the Congress, Sony Ericsson presented another mobile phone. The 4GB Walkman, W950 UMTS phone. The new device is 106 x 54 x 15 mm big and weighs 112 g. It runs on Symbian v.91 OS and UIQ 3.0 platform. The 4GB flash memory and the 2.6" QVGA display with 262K colors make the stylish Walkman phone very desirable for music lovers. The W950 supports multiple music file formats like MP3, m4a, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV. The UMTS device also has Bluetooth, Infrared and USB connectivity features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Sony Ericsson W950 Walkman
 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Sony Ericsson P990</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We spent some time with the Sony Ericsson P990. The fully featured phone is almost too big for our taste, but the current P910 users are already used to this size. The phone is fast and responsive. Anyway, the software is not yet ready for the prime time - for example the Video application crashed when we tried to play one of the sample videos installed on the phone.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson M600<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>       Sony Ericsson M600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson M600 was announced not long ago and is similar to the newly announced W950 model. Both phones have similar form factor and no camera. The M600 has less internal memory and Memory Stick card slot, while W950 relies entirely on the huge 4GB internal memory. The M600 QWERTY keyboard is another difference. We were interested how is the new keyboard and we tried the phone on the Sony Ericsson stand. Each of the keys can be pressed either in the left or right edge and this way the 20 keys can function as a full QWERTY keyboard. It's definitely faster to write this way, instead of the traditional multi press way without T9 enabled. We see this keyboard as an experiment and we are not sure how successful it will be. After all, the phone has virtual onscreen QWERTY keyboard and for most of the users this keyboard will be a faster way to enter text.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W810<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>         Sony Ericsson W810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expect the W810 Walkman model to be a big commercial success for Sony Ericsson (just like K750 and W800) and this is why it was interesting for us to try the new phone. The W810 is a successor of both K750 and W800 models, it gets the color and design from K750 and the Walkman player from W800. The new model is quad-band and has the long expected EDGE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson W810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the W810 is not much different from the W800 for example. The new Walkman now has Activity menu, which is common for the new Sony Ericsson models. We were interested in the photo application and we took some test photos with W810. Again, please don't judge the phone too harshly - the firmware of the device is still in beta and the lighting conditions in the Sony Ericsson booth were unfavourable.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>For Samsung, the 3GSM Congress is a possibility to present many new phone models and this year's event in Barcelona is not an exception. This year's series of Samsung are mainly aimed in two directions: thin 3G phones and new technologies. WiBro, HSDPA, T-DMB and other technologies are supported by some of the new Samsung models. We hope that this year a higher percentage of the announced phones will find their way to the market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung P900 and P910<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>P900 and P910 TV twins were the main attraction at the Samsung stand. The P900 has T-DMB support, while the P910 supports the DVB-H standard. The phones are based on a Korean TV model. Interesting enough, the P910 model has lower specs than P900 - less memory and lower resolution camera. The phones are not 3G, they are GSM tri-band only. The TV signal can be stored in mpeg4 format on the 128 MB internal memory or on a memory card, using the microSD slot. The announced release date is Q2 2006, but with Samsung we just can't be sure if the phones will hit the market or get silently canceled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z560<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Z560 is being heavily advertised in Barcelona these days. Samsung managed to organize a heavy outdoor advertising of this model before the actual announcement day. Z560 has 1.8 Mbps HSDPA (High-speed Download Packet Access) support. This slim clamshell has a 2.3" 262K colors internal display and a 1" 65K colors external one. Samsung cooperates with Vodafone in the HSDPA development and the Z560 will be shipped for the first time by this carrier. The new device has 2 megapixel camera, stereo speakers, 30 MB internal memory and other common features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Z560</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i320<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The story with the i320 model is quite interesting. It was announced on 13 Feb and it was included in all press materials. Then, the next day it was taken off from the Samsung stand and we were told that the model was included in the press releases by mistake. The phone will be announced again in CeBIT. The Samsung i320 strongly resembles the Motorola Q model. It runs on Windows Mobile 5.0 OS and has a QWERTY keyboard with two letters assigned to one digit. The display of the device is 2.2" 65K colors QVGA. It has 120 MB built-in memory and a miniSD slot. Samsung i320 also features Bluetooth and USB connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung i320</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z600 3G Smartphone is based on the S60 platform and has a 2 megapixel camera, miniSD slot, 2.1" internal display and a 1.0" external one. Samsung already has two Symbian models on the market (D720 and D730), so maybe this one will reach the market too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z350<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Z350 has E350-like design but with more features included, 1.3 megapixel camera, QVGA display, microSD slot and more. But still it's a low-end 3G phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Samsung Z350</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z320i<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Z320i is based on the Z350 model but has i-mode support. Piscel View, memory card slot and the display resolution have been cut. Z320i has 120 MB internal memory. It will go for almost the same price because of the i-mode browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Z320i</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z330<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another copy of their own design is the Z330, which is based on E330. Features like the better display (176 x 220 pixels resolution and 262K colors), 1.3 megapixel camera and Bluetooth are built-in in this device. It has 140 MB internal memory but no card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Z330</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z510<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z510 3G clamshell is almost a copy of Samsung D810, only with different design. It doesn't have a memory card slot, but for compensation the internal memory is increased to 138 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Z510</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z540<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z540 has more internal memory, two stereo speakers and a non-rotating camera, compared with Z510. The resolution of the external display is also better (128 x 218 pixels versus 96 x 96 pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Z540</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z310<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Z310 is another model, presented at the 3GSM Congress and has more features, despite of its lower index. It has microSD slot, Piscel View, external music control buttons and two stereo speakers. The Samsung Z520 is almost the same. It only has 2 megapixel camera and 3D games support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Z310</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Z150<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Z150 is very thin and light 3G bar phone. It will compete with recent offers in this segment like Sony Ericsson K610 and BenQ-Siemens S81.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Z150</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung P300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The P300, or widely known as the calculator phone, was also on the Samsung stand. The phone looks better live than on pictures. It is just slightly bigger than a credit card and has a very bright display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung P300</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung D800 and D820<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The not so new D800 and D820 sliders were there too and are almost certain to hit the markets very soon.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Serene<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Serene model, cooperation with Bang &amp; Olufsen, was also on the Samsung stand. What we can say is that it is too awkward to use and it doesn't look like something this expensive. Yes, it will be exclusive.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>At the 3GSM Congress in Barcelona Nokia introduced only three S40 handsets. The interest to the new devices was not very high, but anyway the Nokia booth was crowded, because of the high-end handsets from the N and E series.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6136<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 6136 model is a UMA-enabled phone. UMA technology is Unlicensed Mobile Access. This means that such devices will be able to operate both on GSM and WLAN networks. Another innovative technology is included in Nokia 6136, DARP (Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance) which improves the capacity of radio frequency use. The bandwidth rate increases by more than 40 %. For now, the DARP technology is not very common but if proved successful it will become widely spread in other devices. With its S40 interface, microSD, 1.3 megapixel camera and FM radio Nokia 6136 seems to be more than just a middle-end clamshell. This new device will be primarily shipped for Orange carrier and its price is expected to be around 275 EUR. Nokia 6136 is expected to be available in Q2 2006.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6136</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6131<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other new clamshell of Nokia, the 6131 is also very nice with its True Color 16 million colors internal display with QVGA resolution. In fact, the 6131 model looks more expensive than the 6136 because of the impressive display. The new device supports many audio formats and with its hot swap microSD slot it can be used as a music player. It also has FM radio, IrDA, Bluetooth and is a very interesting phone. It can be considered a competitor of the Samsung phones in the same class. The expected price of Nokia 6131 is 275 EUR and it will be available in Q2 2006.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Nokia 6131</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6070<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new budget 6070 model is a successor of Nokia 6030. This device is generally aimed at the price sensitive Nokia fans and does not shine with high functionality. It has EDGE, VGA camera, IrDA, FM radio and the S40 user interface. This tri-band Nokia 6070 will go for about 135 EUR and will be available in Q2 2006.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Nokia 6070</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interest to the N and E series was very high. All of them seemed quite functional and without obvious bugs and glitches, so maybe we can expect to see them on the market soon.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Although Motorola had a very strong presence on 3GSM Congress 2006 Barcelona, they haven't presented many exciting new devices. It's seems that they are concerned about the widespread RAZR wannabe products and will start to announce their new products closer to their shipment dates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a press conference held on the first day of the congress Motorola outlined its vision for the future. They are aiming high; their main slogan was "Connecting the next billion".</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola showed some statistics for 2005; according to the slides, Motorola has the highest shipment growth and the best selling product in Europe (RAZR V3 with 5.1% share in the market). In the handset business they are positioned in first place on the North American and Latin American market and in second in Europe and North Asia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some Motorola 2005 statistics</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that the 4-letter naming of the most interesting Motorola products won't stop this year. DSGN is a 4-letter word for Motorola and it's quite interesting for us why Q and Z models only got one letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  DSGN</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the news from the conference is that Motorola Q and Z models will have versions for the European market. Q will be shipped as EV-DO device for North America first, while Z will start as CDMA phone for Korea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola also announced the cheap W220 RDIO phone with RAZR-like design for the developing countries. The device doesn't have an external display, but has 3 LEDs instead. Not a bad idea to keep the price low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another news was that the Asian A1200 model will be called MING (transparent) for the European market. The MING was just approved for tri-band support and is expected to hit the European and U.S. markets soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>         The handsets</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Scalpel model, or as it's now called SCPL, was not introduced as expected. Anyway Motorola seems to have some huge plans for it looking at the Nokia caricature they presented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung has a PEBL ad too; Nokia afraid of the SCPL?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ron Garriques (Motorola Executive) said that Motorola will introduce a full line of HSDPA devices in Q3 and Q4 2006.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>After taking over of Siemens's mobile division, BenQ created a new line of mobile phones. Some of them were announced not long ago and some were shown at the 3GSM Congress in Barcelona. Siemens and BenQ phones were also showcased at the booth along with the new BenQ-Siemens models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BenQ-Siemens booth</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenQ-Siemens EF91<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The major model is the EF91. One of the strong points of this model is the HSDPA support, the other is the 3.2 megapixel camera. The EF91 has QVGA internal display with 262K colors and an external OLED with 65K colors. The phone is also equipped with 32 MB built-in memory and a microSD slot for additional storage. With the A2DP Bluetooth profile the EF91 has wireless headset support. BenQ-Siemens EF91 feels quite big, but most of the 3G clamshells are big too. What we didn't like is that the design of the phone looks a bit dated. The menu graphics however look really impressive. The phone lacks EDGE support (GPRS class 10 only), it depends entirely on HSDPA for the fast data transfers. The Samsung Z560 is the main competitor of EF91 and although it has only a 2 megapixel camera currently it looks like a better offer. We are yet to see which one of these will be on the market first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     BenQ-Siemens EF91</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenQ-Siemens S81<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3G S81 bar is tri-band GPRS Class 10 and also has two cameras, the one on the front panel is for video calls. The new 3G phone will fight for its place in the class of thin 3G bars. EDGE support is missing again. S81 has 30 MB internal memory, assisted by the microSD slot and supports many audio codecs thus can be considered as a music phone. The phone looks and feels very good and although with a lower resolution display, it has the same colorful graphics as the EF91 model. The BenQ-Siemens S81 is expected to hit the market in Q2 2006 and the expected price is around 300 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     BenQ-Siemens S81</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenQ-Siemens EF51<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The EF51 is the BenQ-Siemens solution for music lovers. It's more a MP3 player, which can make calls than a phone, which can play music. The sound in the headphones is good. The built-in speaker is quite loud for such a small device. Regrettably, the device looks and feels cheap, because of the materials used. Music playback control buttons are located on the flip. Volume control and camera switch buttons are on the left side of the phone. The device has 20 MB internal memory and miniSD card slot. The camera is 1.3 megapixel. The display is low resolution and the main menu looks ugly compared to EF91 for example. BenQ-Siemens EF51 music phone will be available in Q2 2006 and the expected price is 220 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      BenQ-Siemens EF51</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>EF81, S88 and S68<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other three BenQ-Siemens models announced a month ago were also presented on 3GSM. The EF81 3G clamshell seems to be a Siemens design. The phone even claimed to be Siemens SFG75 during the start up process. The EF81 unit presented had a Star Wars theme installed and demonstrated the quality of the main QVGA display, too bad the menu was too plain. The S88 in white with dark theme looked very good and if it hits the market soon it might be a competition for Sony Ericsson K750. The aluminum S68 is good looking too, but the lower class display leaves bad impression.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>At the 3GSM Congress in Barcelona Sagem announced mobileTV, my700x, W-7 3G and a bunch of low-end handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem entered the mobile TV competition with the model myMobileTV. To speed the things up, they used X8 as base and added DVB-H receiver. Unfortunately, for some reason they had to remove the Bluetooth support. The phone seemed very functional on the stand, but the expected release date is not very clear - we were told that it will be the second half of this year. Now the phone has a strange retractable antenna which sticks out from the bottom. Depending on the testing results of the DVB-H receiver the antenna might be removed in the final design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Sagem myMobileTV</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UMTS my800X can be considered a high-end phone. It is also based on the myX8 model and the only differences between them are the front camera and the 3G support. The unit presented was just a mockup, the screen was just a color sticker, so we don't expect Sagem my800x to be available soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sagem myW7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The my700X music phone has 262K colors display with 176 x 220 pixels resolution. This device has FM radio and a nice music player with 3D effects and equalizer. Sagem my700X supports mp3, AAC and AAC+ audio formats. It also has Bluetooth A2DP profile for wireless headset. With EDGE support, USB connectivity and miniSD slot it seems good. The phone also has 1.3 megapixel camera and 3D games support. We took a picture with my700x at the Sagem stand. Please note that the lighting conditions were not good and the phone software is not final. Sagem myW7 is an UMTS phone with similar features and more traditional keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sagem my700X</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Picture from the Sagem my700X camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sagem myW7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my300X is very much alike the myX6-2 model. With its 65K 128 x 128 pixels resolution display it's still less functional and thicker. The internal memory (3.2 MB) seems enough for ringtone uploading since the model does not support other multimedia features. The expected price of this device is 100 USD and thus it seems like a reasonable offer. The my301X has some additional features, like Bluetooth and SyncML. The my302X also has an infrared port and improved shock and dust resistance. The my302x might not look pretty on the pictures, but actually leaves a good impression when taken in hand. It has a rubber coating and feels very solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sagem my302X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other phones, based on the 300 line are the my400X and my401X. They have bigger displays with 128 x 160 pixels resolution and 65K colors. These Sagem phones have Java, VGA camera and the same amount of internal memory (3.2 MB). The difference between them is that my401X has Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Sagem my401X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the low-end class, Sagem is going for the thin trend. The my100X and my101X are both part of their "slim" line. They're both with monochrome displays but the my101X has colorful backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The my200X, my201X and my202X represent the more functional class, but still low-end. They have color displays with 4096 colors and 101 x 80 pixels resolution. Sagem announced that all three phones have Hi-Fi tones. The difference between them is that my201X has GPRS and my202X supports MMS.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The 3GSM Congress in Barcelona was a great opportunity for LG to show their latest achievements in mobile phones. They showcased European versions of mobile phones already in the Korean market as well as 3G devices and TV phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG KG920/KV5500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The highlight this year was the KG920 model. Its 5 megapixel camera, using CCD matrix, is integrated in the rotary keypad block. The camera has a strobe flash, like a regular digital camera and can record video clips in VGA resolution with 30 frames per second. The internal memory of 128 MB is complemented by a miniSD card slot. We were told that the LG KG920 expected release date for Europe is April 2006 and we are willing to believe this, because a similar phone is already released in the Korean market - the LG KV5500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KG920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KG920 model was locked in a glass-case, but we had the chance to play for a while with the KV5500 Korean version. The only difference between this phones is the networks supported. The 5 megapixel phone leaves very good impression. The construction is solid and functional. The phone has a lot more keys than most of the bar phones. The off-center control button is not very convenient, but not a big problem. The three softkeys speed up the navigation. The display is impressive and the user interface looks really good, it can successfully compete with the latest Samsung designs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KV5500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main screen, menu, 3D games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, our main interest was the 5 MP camera. LG were pretty sure in the quality of the camera and have set up a small well lit football corner for test shots. In this conditions, the autofocus worked reliably, but not very fast. Saving a 5 megapixel photo freezes the phone for 3 seconds. The phone however is very fast when browsing the taken photos, the zoom-in process is almost seamless and it is not delayed even for a bit. We hope we can offer you full size pictures from the LG KV5500 camera soon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG TV phones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mobile TV support in T-DBM format was presented in the V9000 model with swivel screen. The strange thing about this phone is the external antenna, which is totally inappropriate since this is a 2006 3G phone. LG also had DVB-H TV phone on the stand with a similar construction.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG U8850<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The boldly colored LG U8850 was also at display. The phone looks a little strange, the design and colors are quite feminine, while the size can be considered big even for a man's hand. Although it says "Wide display", the display is actually square - 220x220 pixels.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG U880<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The U880 model, with its Roberto Cavalli Edition was also shown. The special designer variations differs from the plain one only in the front cover, which is decorated in various zebra patterns. The U880 has a classic clamshell design with a rotating camera and is considered as a music phone. LG also advertise it as a "slim" phone but actually it's quite thick (18.2 mm), there are 3G phones that are slimmer. The device is supplied with common functions, like 1.3 megapixel camera, 262K internal and 65K internal displays.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The NEC phones are not widely available in Europe. Maybe this is why they are chosen by users, who look for design and exclusivity and don't want to pay for a Vertu for example. NEC describes their phones as "East meets West" - a combination of Italian design and Japanese technology. Three new GSM phones were presented by NEC at the 3GSM Congress.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>After selling their mobile division to TCL Mobile, Alcatel was expected to renovate their technologies and offer brand-new mobile solutions. But at the 3GSM Congress were shown only models with old technologies. With the only exception of the S853 model, the company is offering budget handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alcatel booth</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel announced a bunch of phones at the 3GSM Congress, but nothing attracted our attention much. Most of the new phones were not functional and were locked in a glass-case. Instead of real displays they had color stickers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel now fits their products in five lines - Zen - E157, E256, E265 and C550 - Black - E100, E259, E260, E801 and S853 - Fashion - E257, ELLE N1, ELLE N2, C630 - Urban sport - E105, E252, C650 - Liquid - C750</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The PG8000 is very unusual in design and has the eye-catching effect. There are some issues in its ergonomics and can be hardly held in one's left hand. The new device has text pronouncing feature, which can read SMS messages with its metallic voice. A megapixel camera also can be found on the back of the Pantech PG8000.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Pantech PG-8000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A low-end 3G phone has been presented also. The GU-1100 bar phone has two VGA cameras, microSD slot and music player options. But still it's just a low-end phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Pantech GU-1100</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The 3GSM Congress in Barcelona was the ideal place for the manufacturers to show a new technology, which might be used in mobile devices soon. Sharp and Toshiba were demonstrating 2.4" VGA displays on their stands. Current top of the line high-resolution displays used in the mobile phones are QVGA (240x320 pixels). The only exception are some Nokia S60 devices with 352x416 pixels resolution. The VGA displays have four times the resolution of a QVGA display. The pixels of the display are really, really small and as a result the pictures shown on these displays are just impressive.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba VGA display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the VGA displays require four times the computing power compared to the QVGA, they feature a compatibility mode, this way then can show QVGA picture, when the additional resolution is not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  QVGA and VGA mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  QVGA and VGA mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   More VGA samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The future will tell if these displays will find their way in the mobile phones. Our opinion is that they are a lot more needed in devices like digital cameras and specific applications like GPS. In a common device, like the mobile phone, such resolution is just not needed. Some of the users will not see the difference between VGA and QVGA on a 2.4" screen.</paragraph>
