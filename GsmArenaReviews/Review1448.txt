			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Yesterday?s high-end is the new midrange we like to say. The Nokia C6 has almost exactly the same features as the Nokia N97 mini but hangs a big Sale sign. Time to shop for high-end features off high street.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C-series are trying to distill the Nokia knowledge and experience into a lineup of simple and affordable phones. There?s a bit of everything there: from cheap entry-level handsets to smartphones that border on the Eseries and Nseries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And Nokia is in no mood to relax it seems. The C-series went from one to six in almost no time, and a C7 may as well be on the way. Now, technically there is no number four ?but that?s one number Nokia isn?t really fond of. Anyway, if there ever was to be a C4 we just know it would?ve been dynamite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a C-series phone, you can expect the C6 to be a decent all-rounder. And it is. There?re no mind-blowing features but there?s nothing major missing either. And what isn?t there (e.g. document editing) can be easily fixed with the right app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These days, communication over text-based channels is bigger than ever ? SMS, email, Twitter, Facebook, IM to name but a few. And they have a certain advantage over voice calling. They?re cheap, or absolutely free, even when you?re reaching someone on another continent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text-based messaging is important. But as good as touchscreen input methods are getting (especially with clever tricks such as Swype), there?s just no match for a good hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t as much pressure on the Nokia C6 as there was on the N97 duo. The C6 is not a top-tier device ? it?s a high volume device instead. You know, the one most people end up buying after deciding that the dream device costs too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how close exactly is the Nokia C6 to the N97 mini? Jump to the next page to find out how the hardware of both stacks up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box covers the essentials and leaves it at that. You have the charger plus a (short) data cable. The charger is absolutely tiny ? a good thing since you?ll have to carry it when you travel, as the Nokia C6 doesn?t charge off USB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The included headset is one-piece, so replacing the headphones while keeping the remote is not an option. There isn't a stylus included in the Nokia C6 retail package but we don?t miss that too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2GB microSD card is supplied, but keep in mind that unlike the Nokia N97 and N97 mini, the C6 doesn?t have much of a built-in memory. You can use a bigger microSD card to compensate, the C6 supports cards of up to 16GB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C6 spins 360-degrees<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 is somewhere between the Nokia N97 and the N97 mini in terms of size. It?s got a 3.2? touchscreen just like the N97 mini and the front face dimensions are about equal, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the C6 stands at 113 x 53 x 16.8 mm and weighs a hefty 150 g. It?s quite a bit thicker than the mini (and heavier). That?s almost a full millimeter thicker too than the regular N97.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the N97 mini, the Nokia C6 has room on the keyboard for a D-pad (like the big N97). The downside here is that while the keys on both keyboards are about the same size, the ones on the C6 keyboard are cramped together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll discuss the keyboard in more detail later. For now, let?s just say that the Nokia C6 is on the chubby side of side-sliding QWERTY phones, but it?s not the chubbiest by far. For comparison purposes, the ?petite? Sony Ericsson X10 mini pro is 17 mm thick and the Motorola MILESTONE weighs a hefty 165 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s more than obvious the C6 is similar to the N97 in many ways. When closed however, it is a dead ringer for the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the phone which very much set the overall look and feel for many of Nokia?s touch phones. Sliding it open is where the comparisons with the Nokia N97 duo begin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it should be where they end, at least regarding the keyboard itself. In many ways, it?s much closer to the Nokia E75 ? no tilting display and a four-row QWERTY with no margin between the keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C6 has a 3.2? resistive touchscreen of nHD resolution ? the popular choice among Symbian phones. The 360 x 640 pixel resolution is quite right for that size, though obviously no match for the pixel-dense screens of high-end touch phones. The response of the resistive display is good enough, but not as good as capacitive displays are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility on the other hand is poor ? taking the Nokia C6 outside on a sunny day means you?ll have to shield the display against bright sunlight if you want to see anything on the screen. That?s quite unlike Nokia N97.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bellow the screen is the usual trio of green and red receiver keys and the menu key. The menu key is placed in the middle, like on the Nokia 5800. We liked the N97 solution better though of putting it on the side, skewed 45 degrees. That made the key equally easy to use in both portrait and landscape orientation. With the Nokia C6, you have to aim right between the call keys, but you?ll get used to it quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a lot going on above the screen with a bunch of sensors placed around the earpiece at the center. The C6 has an ambient light and a proximity sensor, and a dedicated QVGA video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls on the sides of the Nokia C6 have a similar layout to that of the 5800 XpressMusic. On the right side, from top to bottom there?re the volume rocker, the lock/hold key and the shutter key. The left side features the protected microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Nokia C6 is the sealed microUSB port. Right next to it is the 3.5mm audio jack, which is left exposed. The bottom of Nokia C6 holds the 2mm charger plug, the mouthpiece and the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One important thing to note here is that the Nokia C6 doesn?t charge off USB ? so, you?ll have to carry the charger (which is very compact, but still) when you travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera lens is on the back of the Nokia C6, right next to the LED flash. Those aren't protected by anything, so you?ll have to take care not to scratch them. To the right of the camera we find the single loudspeaker (no stereo speakers here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover, there?s the SIM card compartment and a BL-4J battery rated at 1200mAh. It is the same capacity as the battery in the N97 mini and is quoted at 384 hours of standby (both 2G and 3G) and up to 7 hours (2G) or 5 hours (3G) of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 rear cover has a small latch that makes it very easy to open. The rear panel itself is quite wobbly however, which doesn?t make a very good impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The badly fitting battery cover aside, the build quality of the Nokia C6 is satisfactory. The matte plastic on the back is nice to the touch and, more importantly, fingerprint resistant. The front, with the touchscreen and all, will inevitably gather smudges, but that?s par for the course these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard left a positive impression as did the smooth, spring-assisted slider. There?s an option to lock the phone when you close the slider, but you can?t set it to launch an app (say, the SMS composer) when you open it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Nokia C6 isn?t a problem ? the phone allows comfortable one-handed operation and the weight balance is good. Its thickness is a bit of problem for pocketability though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Comfortable QWERTY keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So far the C6 basically sounds like a Nokia 5800 XpressMusic with a better camera. The major feature that the Nokia C6 has over its older cousin, however, is the QWERTY keyboard. The screen doesn?t tilt like it did on the N97 duo, but you can still comfortably hold the keyboard and look at the screen head on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is comparable to the one on the Motorola MILESTONE (or DROID in the US) ? and that?s quite a compliment. The keys are about the same size, but not as flat and with good feedback, making the keyboard very comfortable to use. The top row is somewhat cramped against the top half of the slider though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four-row QWERTY on the Nokia C6 has more keys and fewer symbols per key compared to the three-row keyboard of the N97, so occasions where you need to use the function key are rarer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the keyboard is strong and quite even, so you won?t have problems using it in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is accompanied by a D-pad ? it?s on the right side this time rather than the left like it was on the N97. The Nokia N97 mini omitted the D-pad to leave more room for the rest of the keyboard. On the other hand, the wider borders between the keys on the N97 mini improved the typing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We compared the C6 to the Nokia E75, another keyboard we quite liked. The two keyboards are very similar, however the keys on the C6 are smaller ? because of the D-pad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 runs S60 5th edition and our test unit comes with the 10.0.024 firmware release. You must have seen plenty of Symbian in touchscreen action and nothing here should come as a big surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is our unboxing and user interface video. If you want to skip the retail package exploration, the UI demo starts at 00:50.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are glad to note that kinetic scrolling keeps on getting better. It is available almost throughout the user interface ? from file and web browsers through gallery to contacts and even the main menu. Finger scrolling has been improved as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until now widgets were limited to Nseries, but the C6 is kind enough to bring them on board. A widget-enabled homescreen mimics the good old Active Standby but instead of slots you now get nicely thumbable blocks. However, if you were hoping for thumb-scrollable multiple homescreen panes, you are again out of luck, even though the competition has had these for a long time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S60 5th is in essence a direct translation of D-pad and soft-key action into touch. Although it has its benefits, the result is hardly the most fluent and intuitive touchscreen interface there is. Scrolling and accessing items across the interface is nothing like other touch platforms we've tried. On the other hand, soft-keys work just fine and enhance usability compared to other touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the user experience with S60 5th is a mixed bag and what you think of it will entirely depend on your background. If you know your way around S60, you'll be quite at home with the C6 interface. But if you come from an alternative touchscreen platform you'll find yourself climbing a fairly steep learning curve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening an item in any of the listed submenus requires not one, but two presses - one to select, and another one to confirm the action. Now that's something that you don't normally see in other touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get used to it with time, but the main issue here is that the interface logic is different when you deal with icons instead of lists.When the opened menu uses icons to represent items as opposed to lists, then a single click usually does the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least kinetic scrolling will make you feel way more comfortable than those first 5800 XpressMusic users.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Homescreen and main menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure leaves no doubt you're on Symbian turf. Icons are set in a 3 x 4 grid or a list that you can freely reorder. Screen orientation can be set to change automatically thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen layout of the C6 is typical Symbian and looks exactly the same as it did on the Nokia N97 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A single press on the clock starts the clock application (with an option for setting up an alarm) while tapping on the date launches the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tap, this time on the Profile button, leads you to the profile options where you can edit the currently active profile or change it (which does make using the the Power key for that purpose redundant).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also access the connectivity menu from here by tapping around the battery status indicator, which is one of the ways to initiate a WLAN search. It is not as quick as having the WLAN Wizard as a homescreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's take a closer look at the widgets. The space underneath the status icons and the clock can fit up to 5 widgets at a time. A sideways finger sweep will hide or display them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of widgets to choose from ? there are tools like the WLAN wizard, music player controls, calendar, email, etc. There?s a widget for favorite contacts and a shortcut widget. You can have two of each at a time. The other widgets are linked to various sites and services: Facebook, MySpace, Bloomberg, CNN video and quite a few more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Store comes in handy when you get bored of the preinstalled widgets, but will cover that in more length later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arranging widgets is easy and fun. You can remove some of them, add others, change their order (just drag and drop). If all 5 slots have been taken, you have to remove one or more widgets to make room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Contacts bar each contact is represented by the contact photo and their first name. Up to four favorite contacts can be displayed at a time and the list isn?t scrollable left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact from the Contact bar brings up a screen with buttons to start a voice or video call, compose a text message or E-mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Shortcuts bar is ready to accommodate shortcuts to your favorite apps or web sites. You can even have two Favorite Contacts widgets and two Shortcut widgets displayed on the homescreen (if you happen to need them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 features a task manager which is launched by a press-and-hold on the menu key. The task manager itself is identical to what you get on Symbian S60 3.2 devices. Much like in the previous version of the UI, it appears on top of every pop-up menu. To close running applications use the hardware backspace key or press and hold the app's icon to display two virtual buttons: Open and Exit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated hardware switch on the right-hand side of the device will lock / unlock the phone. The lockscreen has a virtual swipe-to-unlock button .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 phonebook has virtually unlimited capacity and its functionality is certainly among the best out there. The Nokia C6 contacts list also has kinetic scrolling enabled and it?s among the best examples to find on a Nokia touch phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and you can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When searching for a contact you make use of a clever dynamic keypad, which shows you only the letters that correspond to actual contacts. Once you type in a first letter, their number decreases, leaving only the ones that actually make up real contacts names. A really convenient tool indeed, even if you have a real QWERTY keyboard to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also assign personal ringtones and videos. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors ? accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: smart dial on QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality is good on both ends of calls, the earpiece sound is crisp and there were no reception problems whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is enabled and the implementation is quite good. Ass soon as you hit a few keys on the keyboard, all the matches are displayed. You get the contact?s name and photo on screen ? pressing and holding will bring up virtual buttons to start a voice or video call, or compose a text message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get an onscreen virtual dial pad too ? it will be used we think, as the physical QWERTY keyboard doesn?t have a numpad ? the number keys are on the top row (computer keyboard style).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also enabled on the Nokia C6. The voice dial mode is activated once you press and hold the Call key. It is fully speaker-independent and doesn't require pre-recording the names of your contacts. Bear in mind though, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, it will dial the default one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, you can silence an incoming call (or snooze an alarm) by simply flipping the handset over. Also when in calls, the proximity sensor makes sure the screen turns automatically off when you pick the phone up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the hardware screen-lock switch you can not only unlock the phone but also silence it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 scored an Average in our traditional loudspeaker test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY-fied messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY-enabled Nokia C6 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. They all share a common intuitive editor which by this point should be quite familiar to everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, there to meet almost any emailing needs. The easy setup we found in the latest Nokia handsets is also available with the C6. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email on the go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia C6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. This can save you some data traffic charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here might just be the right time to mention the input options on Nokia C6. Along with the pretty comfortable hardware QWERTY keyboard, the handset also offers a standard on-screen numpad and support for handwriting recognition. There is no virtual QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is still quite slow<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia C6 is nicely touch optimized and there are sweep gestures enabled for flipping through photos displayed fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort images by date, title or size and you can also copy, move and delete them. Sending them via Bluetooth, email, MMS or sharing them online is also available straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default view is portrait but you can go to landscape automatically thanks to the built-in accelerometer. A slide show is also available but it doesn't have as many customizable settings as on some Nseries handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also zoom in the photos to see more detail. Zoom is controlled via either the volume rocker or an on-screen touch slider. In all other cases, images are displayed full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the gallery problems is speed. Loading a picture takes a couple of seconds even for small images. If you have a large number of photos it might take ages before the thumbnails are generated. Zooming and panning are not that much faster either. On the other hand, kinetic scrolling has been vastly improved. The real nuisance though is that photos in a folder require a double tap to display ? one to select, another to open.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good ol? music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 music player is pretty functional but its design could use a little freshening up - it hasn't changed since we first saw it in the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. With user friendliness such a key aspect of full touch phones, it would be nice from Nokia to add some fun to the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and or composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is available. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You won't need to do that if you upload the music via the proprietary PC Suite application. With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone won't handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is also supported and if you don't like the default sound of the device you can enhance it by applying one of the five equalizer presets. And if they?re still not enough you can set new ones up in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. However , if you haven?t set the Music Player widget on the homescreen, you will have no way to control it. Your only option would be to go back to the full music player app using the Task manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6 isn't the loudest handset around but provides nicely clean audio output. The readings it achieved in our test are very satisfying and there is very little to moan about really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response indicates slightly cut-off extreme high frequencies (nothing you can actually hear anyway) and the intermodulation distortion is slightly high but that's it. The noise levels, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are just great, comparable to the best in class. Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6 vs Nokia C5 frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>DivX/XviD support is still a no-go for the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ample screen generally makes watching a video on the Nokia C6 a pleasure. However the lack of DivX and XviD codecs makes actually playing one somewhat of a harder task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can use the Nokia PC suite built-in application that automatically converts all kinds of video files to the format and resolution your phone supports. The automatic converter though seems to compress the videos too much, even at the highest quality setting, and they look over pixelated' but so far it's the easiest way of getting compatible video to your handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode but, since anything else would have made the widescreen display useless, this is understandable. When in fullscreen, a tap on the screen shows the controls which are normally hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the RealPlayer, you can not only watch the videos saved in the phone's memory or in the memory card but also to stream Internet video content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia C6 has a neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you're on the go, the C6 should take care of staying tuned to your selected radio station.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6 has a 5 MP camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. The camera UI is similar to what you get in the 5800 XpressMusic, the N97 or the N97 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the settings are squeezed in a combined menu, except for the flash, which has its own dedicated shortcut. We understand that a tabular layout isn't the easiest of things to do on this kind of device but some of the more important features could have had their own shortcuts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the range of settings that the Nokia C6 offers is extensive enough: from manual white balance and ISO to exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast. Various effects are also at hand, labeled as Color Tones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging is enabled but the Nokia C6 omits some of the modern features competing manufacturers are using, such as face detection, smile detection and even blink prevention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder on the Nokia C6 doesn't occupy the whole screen - a bar on the right is reserved for the touch controls. You have a settings button that launches a semi-transparent overlay of all available shooting options, a dedicated Flash button, an on-screen shutter key and finally, the Options menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen shutter key seems absolutely redundant ? it doesn't have a half press/full press action to properly handle auto focus. It would've been way better to have a Quick Settings button instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The picture quality is pretty decent by our books. First of all, resolved detail is more than adequate. Noise reduction finds a good balance between keeping noise levels low and preserving fine detail. There is no purple fringing whatsoever and the white balance and auto ISO settings are well tweaked. Photos have good contrast and accurate colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there go some photo samples from the C6 camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia C6. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface doesn't differ from the still camera much. The camera can capture video in either VGA or the screen resolution (640 x 352 px) resolution, 30 fps in either case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C6 video quality is OK. Colors turn out just fine, but the compression seems too aggressive in most of the clips and produces noticeable artifacts. Anyway, VGA@30fps seems to be the best that Nokia can offer until N8 hits the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a VGA video sample from the Nokia C6.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-in-one connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are usually well-heeled in terms of connectivity and the Nokia C6 is no exception: all contemporary means of data transfer are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User have GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSDPA (3.6Mbps) at their disposal. The GSM/EDGE network support of course comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G is tri-band - 900/1900/2100.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both USB and Bluetooth are version 2.0 and the latter naturally also sports A2DP. Wi-Fi with UPnP support is also at hand. There is a dedicated homescreen widget for the WLAN wizard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm audio jack is also onboard and you?ll have no problems switching to your favorite headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Nokia C6 doesn?t charge off a USB connection. It?s a common issue among the midrange Nokia smartphones and C6 joins the unfortunate list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the storage. Nokia C6 has 240MB internal storage, expandable via a microSD slot. A 2GB card is included in the retail box but you?re likely to need more. The C6 cannot match the built-in storage capacity of the N97 duo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser goes in right direction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 web browser is decently usable, especially now that is also offers kinetic scrolling. Yet there is quite a lot of work remaining before it is able to rival the best in class. The Android and iPhone browsers are miles ahead in terms of user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 browser has very good page rendering and boasts some nice features such as different font sizes (5 options), auto fill-in of web forms and a password manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in RSS reader will handle your feeds, while the download manager keeps things in order. There's also a popup blocker, but bear in mind that you cannot open a new window in any other way but clicking a pop-up link. We'd have really preferred to see an option to open links in a new window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A minimap is available for finding your way around elaborate pages and the Find on page feature is welcome. The visual history is a nice bonus that can help you easily find a page you've visited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now we get to Flash support. Yes, there is Flash support and it?s way better that it was back on X6. The YouTube videos we?ve tested did well with almost none dropped frames. Unfortunately the small screen and resolution won?t allow you to fit the whole YouTube screen in there. Luckily you?ll get about 80% of the windows, which should be enough. Of course, the mobile version of YouTube is always an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another upgrade over the X6 web browser is the better kinetic scrolling. It now works fine and manages to catch up with most of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping on a block of text zooms it in on screen, but again, the text doesn't fit the zoomed area and you still need to scroll sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the S60 touch-browser is going in the right direction but there's still a lot of work to be done to catch up with the rest. The improved usability and performance is a nice start but it's nowhere near the iPhone or Android standards. The same goes for the resolution, which is hardly a match for WVGA.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 5th edition organizer is pretty well stocked although its applications are already in need of refreshment - especially on a touchscreen. Some of the apps are starting to look boring and dated, having had the same interface for over 3 years now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The developers are still hesitant to put the touch input of Nokia C6 to some good usage and maybe some cool new features. They have only gone as far as to touch-optimize the S60 3rd edition apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word, Excel and PowerPoint files seamlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to get the upgrade at the Ovi Store for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Active notes is advanced application for managing notes. It allows you to attach pictures, sound files or video clips to your memo and has nice and touch-friendly user interface. It's not so daily used app, but still it will find its fans for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the number of alarms is not limited. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone, much like with the Nokia 8800 Arte and 5800 XpressMusic.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS, Ovi Maps and free voice navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 comes with a built-in GPS receiver that managed to get satellite lock in about a minute upon cold start (A-GPS turned off at the time) and keeping the lock was not an issue for the C6 even in dense urban environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with Ovi Maps 3.3 Touch preinstalled (the rebranded Nokia Maps). Since January 2010 all Nokia GPS-enabled Symbian handsets have free lifetime voice-guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps navigation is currently available in 74 countries and 46 languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those. In addition, Nokia have also greatly upgraded the Ovi Maps application itself, so it now packs a cooler looking interface, the Lonely planet city guide and the Michelin restaurant guide with lots and lots of points of interest. There's also an events guide that lists all events happening within a 3km range of your position and provides you with details on each one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-enabled Ovi Maps application itself is doing pretty well in terms of features too. It has four different view modes including satellite and hybrid maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the Ovi Store, you can choose between several sections - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization, Recommended and of course, My Stuff, which shows you the apps you've already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple. It?s a list with the name and logo of each app (or podcast, or whatever), the category it's in (Entertainment, Utilities, etc), price and a star rating out of three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, gives you more details - a description, info on size, reviews by people who have tried it, an option to write your own review or send the description page to a friend, a list of related apps and a Report issue button, which helps you report fraud, spam, abuse, etc., but not bug reports or feature requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching the Store is quite easy if the Recommended section and the Related apps list don't get you what you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Nokia C6 came with very little preinstalled content: just a few apps and one game. Some of them are very handy tools for reading news, handling social networks, weather forecasts, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, since this is Symbian we are talking about, you can also pay a visit to some of the numerous software sites online. You can download the apps straight on your phone or on your desktop computer to transfer to the handset later.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It may look like the same old same old prima facie, but that's exactly what the C series are all about. They are just not the kind of phones to set the place on fire. It's a lineup aimed at the mass market and it doesn't need inspiration and creativity when a couple of tried and tested recipes will do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C series are the melting pot for designs, forms and features that are proven to work. It's a low-cost and risk-free operation - what comes out of the C series isn't burdened with expectations and is more or less immune to criticism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every phone in the C series can trace its lineage generations back. With the C6, it's a clear case of N97 meets 5800 XM. Some may rightfully claim that Symbian touch UI needs quite a bit of genetic engineering to get things right. It can certainly use some new graphics, animations, transition effects and all that eye-candy but it isn't up to the Nokia C6 to deliver it. There's Symbian^3 and ^4 for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you have every right to expect from the Nokia C6 is reasonable build quality, full-suite connectivity, great typing and reliability. And it delivers on all counts - save for a shaky battery cover (we hope it's our unit) and the clunky touch interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On Symbian turf, the Nokia C6 has one major competitor, the Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro. It has a similar screen, but far better processing and graphics, crowned with HD video recording. The features you sacrifice over Nokia C6 are the free voice navigation and access to the growing Ovi Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Vivaz pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the Android species of QWERTY messengers, the Nokia C6 will have to watch out for the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro and LG GW 620. The X10 mini pro runs Android 1.6 Donut, but the Eclair update is on the way. The small size, the capacitive screen and the cool Timescape user interface count in X10 mini pro's favor. The LG GW620 likes to keep a low-profile but might be a reasonable alternative as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro ? LG GW620</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP and the MB220 DEXT are two QWERTY-enabled droids to offer you the MOTOBLUR UI, which takes social networking to a whole new level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola BACKFLIP ? Motorola DEXT MB220 ? Nokia N97 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6 is the most advanced and expensive C series phone so far but it obviously is on the cheap side of smart QWERTY messengers. It's got quite a bit of pressure to handle from competitors and finds it hard to identify a unique selling point. Plus currently it goes for almost the same amount of money as the N97 mini and until its price moves down, the C6 will hardly earn a place for itself in the Nokia's Symbian lineup. We are yet to see how things go though.</paragraph>
