			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is a smart mobile phone. It is so smart, that it has basically everything. It supports 3G, has a 2 megapixel camera, three times more memory space than its forerunners, a radio, a MP3 player, memory card slot? But don't worry, we will also point out many Nokia N70 cons in this extended review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is the second phone from the new N series, announced by Nokia in the spring. All models of this line are extraordinary in a certain way: the N90 model because of its 2 megapixel camera and optics from Carl Zeiss, Nokia N91 because of its built-in hard disk. And here we have the new Nokia N70, even if not that special when compared to the two others described above. It is a Symbian Series 60 smartphone just like its forerunners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Nokia N70</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it is a brilliant smartphone, the best of all in the Series 60. According to our test results, it is also the best current mobile phone in the world. (Note: MobilMania has a complicated system for phone evaluation by assigning a rating in percents in eleven categories and then calculating the average rating. Nokia N70 is currently in the first place by rank from more than 200 evaluated handsets). Nokia N70 just hit the market at a price of about 500 euros.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As Nokia N70 works up on its forerunners, the best I could do would have been to refer to their reviews or even copy certain paragraphs from them and use them here. Eventually, however, we decided to prepare N70's review in an utterly different manner, from the very beginning, as if we had been given a brand new phone. </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Where does it fit?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is a mobile phone, which was engineered as an instrument for both work and fun. It offers an excellent phonebook, good organizer functions, and active cooperation with PC. It gets you on the web, downloads emails, views documents in Microsoft Office or PDF format, and connects you to the 3G network. It is all about compromising though, for small display and keypad are always just a substitute. They can never offer the comfort provided by the bigger devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which devices are made for work mainly? Take a look at Nokia 9500 Communicator, Nokia 9300, Sony Ericsson P910i, Palm Treo 650, for example. A possible combination of a notebook and any mobile that manages the communication part is also a good choice. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the fun part, the users of Symbian smartphones do not need to make compromises. Nokia is equipped with a very good camera. It has an advanced video application, plays MP3 files and features a built-in radio. The game offer is also quite extensive. What could be considered a disadvantage is the fact that N70 does not offer a standard use of games for the N-Gage game console. I tried two demo versions, but they refused to even start. According to various discussion forums on the net, most users experience the same difficulties. As you will be able to read a bit further in the article, these games were the main reason for the phone to have to be formatted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which mobile to use for games? The best is Nokia N-Gage QD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: top-quality plastic ? good outlook ? solid construction Cons: big and heavy ? fingerprints are visible on its surface ? memory card slot cover seems wobbly ? lens cover is not very solid</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N70's design is very attractive. This is not only my opinion. People discussing phones think the same. The reason is that Nokia N70 has finally been given an outlook, which deserves to represent equipment for 500 euros. It is made of plastic, but you won't tell at all. Nokia N70 gives a luxurious metal impression. The plastic material, of which the inner body of the phone is made, is solid and pleasant to touch. I am testing the silver-black version. It is also offered in a combination of white and wine red, but I don't think it looks that good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nokia N70 is a very nice phone </paragraph>
			<paragraph>What is really interesting is the construction of Nokia N70: its dark inner part is covered in silver. The smaller back cover is a slider. In its basic position it meets the bevelled upper part of the front silver cover. When you remove the cover, the camera lens pops out. The cover itself levels with the bottom edge of the front cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction of the removable back cover is better than the one in the 6681 model, where Nokia first presented this construction type. It does not creak. It shows a bit of a play as its plastic shell bends down, but it is not critical. A notable hunch can be seen on the back cover when the phone is looked at from aside. It is what makes the phone thicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia is thicker than other smartphones due to a hunch on its backside </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is big and heavy for a mobile phone. Yet, it is not an exception. The majority of smartphones - except for some HTC models - are big and heavy. When held, however, N70 feels smaller than its forerunner 6681, perhaps due to its oval edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Size comparison </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the table below you can find a size and weight comparison between Nokia N70 and several competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N70 from all sides<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Phone's front side is eye catching thanks to a plate with metal outlook. It is made of plastic and catches fingerprints even though it is not entirely glossy. Fingerprints reign on the display too. Nokia seems to be fully aware of this disadvantage, because they have prepared a special cloth to go with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper left corner of the phone there is a sensor, which regulates the backlighting of the display and the keypad. I really wish Nokia had added a switch-off option for the backlighting, but my expectations were in vain. I just don't find it practical that the keypad beams in a rather disordered manner. On top of it, in the user manual, Nokia states that the display and the keypad may sometimes blink as a side effect. To me though, if nothing else, a possible switch-off function would have saved energy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the upper right corner you will see the lens of the second camera. Its basic task is to facilitate video calls, but it could be used for self-portraits too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Front camera for video calls and self-portraits </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On its right side the phone has a tiny button, which appears to lack any function at first glance. It is active when the back cover is removed and the camera lens is uncovered: the mysterious button is a shutter release which can be used when the phone is held horizontally, like a common digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above this button is the slot cover for the RS-DV-MMC memory card. The cover seems quite fragile, even worse than the one in Nokia 6681. Inside the joint there is a sensor, which signals the OS to close all running applications when the slot cover is open, to ensure the card removal without problems. Nokia N70 comes with a 64 MB memory card in the delivery package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Memory card slot: is it going to survive? </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I like the design of the phone's topside. It has a round switch-off button, which is framed by a thin cover frame. The profile of the phone is unusual too. The speaker is hidden under a big slot. In its corner there is an eyelet for the phone's leather strip, which comes with the standard package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Interesting design</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pop-port connector on the bottom side does not need presentation. What is worth mentioning though is the smaller charge connector, which Nokia started to use in its smartphones. In the box you will find a conversion device, which allows for charging with an older charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Pop-port and a connector for a smaller charger </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need to access the battery the back cover - partly silver, partly black - needs to be removed. The Li-Ion battery has a bit higher capacity than usual - 970 mAh. What should I say about its durability? In all smartphones the situation is the same. You could discharge the battery within a few hours or have it working for about 4 days. It all depends on the way you use your phone. I myself charge a phone of the Series 60 every two or three days, but you should not rely on this. The battery life depends on the usage. Nokia N70's accumulator gets charged in 1.5 to 2 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Naked Nokia</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: Good size and resolution ? Good picture Cons: Nokia knows how to make better displays ? Brightness levels are somewhat lower than in the forerunners</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On all accounts, the Nokia N70 display is top-quality . The problem is that resolution that used to be considered brilliant a few years ago is now considered average. So once having seen the quality Nokia presented in its N90 model, which was released even earlier than N70, I just don't have the heart to praise Nokia N70 display. In addition, it is quite obvious that the next smartphone models will feature a significantly higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparison aside, you will most probably find the Nokia N70's display quite good. The 176 × 208 pixels resolution is fine enough. The size of 35 × 41 mm is not bad either. Yet, the comparison to Nokia N90, which features a resolution of 352 × 416 pixels, is merciless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Display is good, but it is doubtless that Nokia is able to make better ones </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 has a TFT type active display, able to show 262K colors. As we had the chance to see in earlier reviews, the human eye is not able to make the difference between 262K and 65K colors. The backlighting of the display is even, except for the bright areas in its upper part, where strips of different brightness can be seen. The picture on the display remains perfect no matter from what angles you look at it. If I have to make a comparison between this model's display and the one of Nokia 6681, I prefer the older model for its display is a bit brighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness of N70's display has a 5-step contrast setup. You can also select an interval, in which the backlighting will dimmer and to let the screensaver with a time bar to appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Backlighting </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: Brilliant keypad ? New user key Cons: Smaller keypad and keys ? Call control buttons are difficult to see in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the N70 Nokia has tried to place more keys on a smaller area than it used to do in its older models. The key block is 38 × 33 mm big; whilst in Nokia 6681 it was 45 × 35 mm. The change has turned out well, I think. Even though the keys are smaller, writing is smooth and comfortable. The keys' uplift is perfect. The same holds true for their reactions. When you press a key, a clear click comes out. It is neither too loud, no too quiet. The keys are oblong, so in terms of design, there are no new experiments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad is smaller, but writing is comfortable </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of function buttons is slowly getting to even up with the one of the number keys. Besides the two context buttons below the display and the red and the green receiver buttons for call control, you will also find a few more keys typical for Symbian smart phones:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new button has been also added. Its symbol is a rhomb. In the original phone setup it opens the Gallery. Of course, you can change this and select an application you prefer most. To do so, just press and hold the button - do not search for a customization option in the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> New key is added to the right middle part </paragraph>
			<paragraph>To select an option press the main cursor key. In addition you can assign various applications to all its four ways. If you do this, however, be sure that the Active stand-by mode function is deactivated. More details on this are to be found further in the article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad backlighting is blue with an epicentre below the zero key. All keys are well visible in the dark, except for the two receivers, where the backlighting is low and eliminates the difference between red and green. The keypad is locked with a standard key combination, but you can set it to get locked automatically from the main menu. In such a case the phone comes to life only if you enter a special safety password.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Pros: Active stand-by mode ? Graphic themes ? Training application ? Plenty of both inner and operational memory Cons: Main menu is somewhat wasteful ? Lower speed in comparison to standard mobile phones ? A red button press meant to take you back to the main display now closes the running application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 works with the Symbian OS 8.1a system and user interface Series 60 2nd Edition, Feature Pack 3. At first sight, the environment seems identical to the one of other phones from Series 60. If you look deeper into it though, you will run into certain peculiar novelties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display in the smartphones is no more a sole space for placing pictures, as it used to be at the beginning. It shows the time, the date, the day of the week, the network name and two indicators - of the battery and the signal. In the bottom line you can see the names of the two applications assigned to the context keys (could be changed).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Active stand-by mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new and most interesting element in N70 is to be found in the middle of the display. It is the active stand-by mode, which was first presented in Nokia 6681. You will see five icons in a line. They serve for quick start of the most frequently used programs. The selected programs depend on your choice. Below this line you will find the events of the calendar day and the soonest event from the coming days. The number of uncompleted tasks and the name of the MP3 file (if played) are also displayed here. On top of it, all these bars are active - if you select and press them you will enter the calendar or the task organizer. Nokia has improved the image of its icons: they are sharper, even if smaller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Active stand-by mode: icons and events</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the cursor button serves the active stand-by mode, its ways cannot be used for a quick access to different applications. The good news is that it's possible to deactivate the stand-by mode. In such case Nokia N70 works like the older Series 60 smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Please, add an advanced mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu is classic - it is displayed as a matrix of 3 × 3 icon or as a list; in fact, I have not met anyone, who uses the second option. The icons represent individual applications. They can be placed into folders, but no deeper than one level. It's easy to move the icons, so you will be able to place the most frequently used applications in the first line and this way to adjust the main menu to your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Main menu in a matrix and list format </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I admit I expected more innovations from Nokia in the user interface. An "advanced" mode would have come in handy for sure, especially if it consisted of pure text or tiny icons in order to fit more information in the limited space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the environment can be modified by using graphic themes, which have a new name - Motives. The motives help to change not only the wallpaper, but also the menus' background, the icons, the colors, the symbols etc. Nokia N70 has several pre-set themes. More themes can be additionally downloaded or bought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Four graphic themes: main display and menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Control: bad news<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though the control process in all smartphones is logic, inexperienced users might be confused in the beginning. It may take them a lot of time to find their way around. This is why Nokia has prepared the so-called Training application. It waits under the right context button after the start of the phone and explains all basic functions of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  You will surely learn to navigate Nokia </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is possible that some experienced users of Symbian phones also grow unsure as N70 hides changes: for example, new applications do not appear in the main menu, but in the "My own" item (it did take me some time before I found out where the newly installed programs go). Minor changes can be found also in the control process. For example, the panel with running applications, which pops up when the menu button is pressed and hold, is not possible to leave by pressing the red key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes probably the most serious problem in Nokia N70. In most phones, you need to press the red key, if you want to get from a running application to the main display. In this case, however, the new Nokia does not leave the program in the background, but closes it right off instead! Just try to imagine the following situation: you start the internet browser Opera, you get connected, then you wait for a certain page to get downloaded and opened. The whole process takes about 20 seconds. But if you only happen to wish to do something else in the mean time and you go to the main display, the programs you have started get shut down and you need to start to wait all over again. Or think of ICQ: if you get back to the main display, ICQ closes down, instead of working in background. That is a way that Symbian Series 60 has never behaved before!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If this is not a firmware error, but a steady new feature, then Nokia N70 loses points in the area of multitasking and the possibility of working with several applications at the same time. And what are then 30 MB of memory for, since programs immediately close down?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tip: If you do not want that applications close down when the red button is pressed, you can enter the main display in a different way too. Press and hold the Menu button and wait until the bar with running programs appears. Then select the Telephone option and confirm. Or press the Menu button, which opens the main menu and then press the red button. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Has the phone speed undergone any modifications? No, it has not - at least as far as improving is concerned. Nokia N70 works as fast as its forerunner 6681, for example. In some cases it is even slower. The truth is that any comparison between classic mobile phones and smartphones works in favour of the former ones. For this reason you would do better if you take smartphones as if they were computers, in which the start of any operation takes some time. Yet, it is not that bad. Ask the owners of Symbian smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal memory of Nokia N70 is 30 MB, which is really a lot. It is three times more than what its forerunners had (except for Nokia N90). An even bigger surprise is the presence of 30 MB of operational memory (RAM), which is again three times more. The Phone memory can be extended with RS-DV-MMC cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can expect, I did not have the possibility to check, whether all applications that have been prepared for older models work properly with Nokia N70. I once ran into a problem with ICQ VeriChat, which refused to start. All other programs I tested worked as well as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During the testing process, Nokia N70 got into such a state that my worst fears of how I would not be able to publish the review almost came true. It just refused to get started, until I entered the key combination to format the entire internal memory. I had to do this twice. The problem had its origin in the demo-version of a certain game for N-Gage, which I wanted to install in the phone in order to try it out. In the end, the only solution was to delete all game files with a card reader. The problematic games were Splinter Cell and System Rush. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>To format the phone, you need to press and hold three keys - the green receiver, the asterisk and the 3 number key - and then start the phone. Do not release the keys even after the phone has started. You would better wait until the initial sound starts to play and the hand animation is displayed. In my case it all took about half a minute. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: Good pictures ? Flash is helpful ? A fairly good video ? A new application for picture viewing ? Picture editor Cons: Camera's macro mode is useless ? Slow reactions ? Visible noise in some pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we have already published a detailed review  about the functions of the camera and the video applications of Nokia N70, I intend to be brief here. Nokia N70 is equipped with a camera with a resolution of 1.92 MP, which places it next to the few exceptional phones that can produce about the same picture quality. Contrary to the N90 model, it has not been blessed with the famous Carl Zeiss label. It does not offer auto focus either. Except the especially bad macro pictures, however, N70 takes pretty good photos. There is no doubt that it is one of the best photo mobiles ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera: lens with flash</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video shooting has also been touched up. The duration of each video record is only limited by the free memory space. In addition, the phone offers a better format: 352 × 288 pixels, which is four times more than most camera phones can do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at a sample video </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos: more photos can be seen in the dedicated Nokia N70 camera review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>How to deal with the pictures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The N70 is supplied with a new Gallery application for viewing pictures. Let me try to describe it: in the middle of the display is the enlarged preview of the pictures; the rest of the pictures in smaller previews are rotating around it. Visible are also the title of the selected photo, the date and time of taking, its size and the place, where it has been saved (in the inside memory or on a card). If you select a picture it gets viewed across the entire width of the display. From here you can reach other photos by pressing a key - the transition is nicely animated, almost like in a film.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Gallery main menu ? picture preview ? picture detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike older picture applications, the one in N70 is not able to show pictures across the entire display. It does use zoom, but this works in the smaller frame with status line. Yet, pictures can be displayed horizontally, across the entire screen through the slide show - an option accessible from the Gallery. Here you can not only set the transition speed, but also manually skip a picture or go back. Viewing can be accompanied by music too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Horizontal presentation (in the left picture - transition speed options) </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A little bit disappointing is the fact that the new gallery bypasses any standard file options. All pictures are displayed en block. You can only create virtual albums, which sort the files to a certain extent, but they are far from satisfactory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 also offers a quite advanced picture editor. It contains sepia, black &amp; white, and negative effects. The editor rotates photos, changes the brightness and the contrast degree, changes size, crops. Its menu also offers a red-eye solution as well as an option for adding frames, texts, graphic motives and drawings. It is possible to adjust the intensity of some effects, sharpness for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Picture editor ? contrast settings (the bar on the right indicates the intensity of the effect)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: Rejecting a phone call with a SMS reply ? Unlimited phonebook ? Effortless synchronization ? Excellent voice dialling ? MP3 ringtones ? Supports video calls Cons: Limited call records ? Slower phonebook</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia as a mobile phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not until this paragraph have we spoken about what makes a mobile phone a real phone. The first to come to one's mind is the sound quality. In the case of N70 I can neither criticise, nor praise its sound characteristics. In other words, the sound quality is standard; the loudness is good enough. The same holds true for the built-in handsfree. Calls can be recorded, but records are once again limited to 1 minute, which is quite a shame. I do not dare evaluate the quality of the incoming signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dialling a phone number </paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Received, missed and dialled calls are saved into individual folders of the log application. Each call carries information about its date and time. More missed or dialled calls from one and the same number appear as a single one with the date and the time of the last event. You can call, send a SMS or save a number into the phonebook directly from the log. The log also remembers call lengths and all transferred data, but only if you start the log application from the main menu. It does not work if the log is entered by clicking the green button while in stand-by mode. When entered from the main menu the log lets you go into an even more detailed log, which contains info about all the operations with the phone: individual calls and data transfers. Unfortunately, there is no function to export this data to another device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Log main menu ? detailed list ? data transfers </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tip: the phone gets quicker if you switch off the log function or if you at least set the saving data period to one day, not to the standard 30-day one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if not new, the option for rejecting a call by writing an explanatory SMS is quite worthwhile. When you press the relevant button, an editor with predefined text appears on the display. The text can be modified and then sent right on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Endless phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No changes are to be found in the phonebook. It uses shared memory, which means that it suffers no limitations in terms of the amount of contacts or phone numbers that can fit in it. Beside the name and the surname, which are divided and saved in separate fields, each contact person can be assigned the following details: company, function, nickname, mobile phones, fixed phones, numbers for video calls, fax numbers, pagers, emails, web pages, notes, complete addresses, birth date. It seems that some types of fields can fit in an unlimited number of sub items (for example, the phone let me save several dozens of mobile phone numbers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Searching the list ? contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like most current Symbian Series 60 phones, Nokia N70 phonebook synchronizes with Microsoft Outlook. You have to deal with certain limitations given by the device that is worse or less detailed though. For example, you will not be able to get more than one mobile phone number into Outlook. I mean, you will get them - at least a second one, but it will appear in a different place - in the Auto field).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How you will get into the phonebook depends only on you and your setup. In the standard mode the reference to the phonebook is placed on the first position in the active stand-by mode, but it can also be set to get opened by the context button or the new user key. Once you start the phonebook, just enter the first letter of a name or a surname and the phone will help you search the whole word. I was surprised that N70 fulfils these tasks quite slowly, for other models from the Series 60 equipped with a phonebook of the same capacity do not perform with delays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All contact names from the phonebook can be dialled by voice. The good news is that you do not need to make your own voice record. The phone is said to recognize any voice. In my case, its performance was brilliant. I would press a button, pronounce a name from the phonebook and the phone would display person's portrait, read their name and dial the phone number, which was saved as first. Each number in the phonebook can also be assigned a shortcut option by pressing and holding a selected key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Quick choice setup </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ting-a-Ring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Each name in the phone book can be accompanied by a special ringing melody and a picture. The latter appears as an icon both when you search the contact list (inconveniently covering the heading) and when a call is coming in or going out. The phonebook also supports groups. Each group can be given a specific melody, which also makes it possible to filter calls with the help of ringing profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;A contact name with a picture ? picture accompanies an incoming call ? call groups</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia offers 5 profiles and one additional profile for use in the offline mode, but new profiles are also possible to create. Within the profiles application you can set a ringtone for calls, video calls, messages, emails and chat. Loudness, vibration, keypad sound and filters are setup here too. As for the filtering option, here only the members of the selected groups ring; the rest just blink quietly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Ringing profiles </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing melodies are supported in nearly all formats usually offered by mobile phones. You can use MID files with 64-voice polyphony as basic ones. In addition, Nokia supports MP3 files, AAC, AMR, RealAudio, RealTones, TrueTones, WAV?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is a phone that works with both GSM and 3G. On top of it, it knows how to make video calls. These are standard - when you select a name or a phone number you have to select Video call from the context menu. Then look at the front camera lens. Your image is displayed on part of the display. The other part shows a picture of the opposite party. As the main camera on the backside of the phone is also able to shoot the video, you can also select to switch off the nested control preview. Moreover, you can send the opposite side a static picture as a substitute of the live and animated image of your face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video calls bear relation with the Shared video function, which helps you show different things to the opposite side while you are making a standard phone call in the UMTS net. It is different from video calls, because here you do not have to maintain an active data transfer from the very beginning to the very end of the call. An important condition for the Shared video function to work is that your mobile operator supports UMTS (3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I have to confess that I did not come to make practical tests of the video call application in N70, but I expect it to work in a way similar to the one in the 6680 model.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The function menu to work with messages has been left unchanged. It offers SMS, MMS, emails and the so-called Chat, which is more famous as instant messaging.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Text messages: full comfort<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The space reserved for incoming SMS is limited by the free memory space only. The editor writes in 8 lines, which basically means that a whole message can be displayed en block. It's possible to use T9 or to deactivate it for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Writing SMS ? incoming message in the list ? reading SMS When a SMS is being written the editor counts the characters in each 160-character message from the beginning. It also indicates the amount of messages, into which the particular SMS has been divided. Notice of delivery can be set to come with every sent message or in specific cases only.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia messages: setting can be automatic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 can fit up to 300 KB in a single MMS. As this size is unusually big, please bear in mind that your mobile operator may not be capable of transmitting it. This happened to me even with a MMS of 250 KB - it just did not make it from T-Mobile to Eurotel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editor is otherwise non-sophisticated. Besides texts, multimedia messages can also contain pictures, videos and sound clips; MMS are even possible to divide into pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Common MMS editor </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the option Create presentation is selected, Nokia warns you, that this type of multimedia message is not always correctly accepted by all phones. If you take the risk, the phone offers you a number of patterns and an option for colors and effects modifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Work with patterns </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 manages multimedia messages as well as other data functions thanks to the SettingWizard application. The latter locates your operator and automatically set up all necessary characteristics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 works with emails and attachments in both directions. It supports the POP3 and IMAP4 protocols. The SMTP protocol helps you to send messages. The setup to access a mailbox is simple. It works in the same way like in a computer. If you need help, use the SettingWizard application. To gain access to most international mailboxes you only need to enter a name and a password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Message preview </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The setup menu provides you with various possibilities: you can choose whether to download entire emails together with attachments, or their headers only. A trade-off is also possible - you set the phone to only download the first X KB of each message. N70 checks for new emails regularly, if set to do so. Within this option you can chose, whether to use it in operator's home network only or when in roaming too. In addition, you can select check days, hours (from-to) and a check break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is able to manage nearly everything: it reads messages with diacritics, works with HTML emails, shows and saves attachments. As it supports office formats, you can even open an attachment with a table in Microsoft Excel. Nokia N70 sends emails without problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am not going to pay detailed attention to Chat - the application for instant messaging. It works only if the relevant operator supports it. Besides, Nokia is supposed to support Push to talk, but my efforts to test this application were in vain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: Good calendar ? Functional synchronizing Cons: Non-repeated alarm clock ? Calendar synchronization excludes notes ? Font is unnecessary big ? Significant limits in the voice recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is constantly developing new applications for its smartphones, but it rarely improves the old applications. Perhaps this is the reason why N70 has the same alarm clock as Nokia's first Symbian phone - Nokia 7650. It is too simple and does not have a repeat function. Even Nokia 1100, which costs less than 70 euros, has a better alarm clock than Nokia's best-equipped smartphones. It is a shame, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; An alarm clock from grandma's childhood &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers a month, week and a day view. It is possible to set one of them as a default view. Days with events in the month view are marked with a tiny nook. In the week view they are displayed as different long stripes in a time axis. Beside everything else, the day view provides you with the name and the place of the event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Month, week and day view at the calendar </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add a new item, you can choose among three possible types: a meeting, a note and an anniversary. You need to enter an object, place, time of the event and alert time. The items saved into the calendar can repeat: daily, weekly, every two weeks, every month or every year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar synchronizes with Microsoft Outlook too. The time of the event, the task, the repetition interval and even the place of the event (which is however added in brackets next to the object) are easily sent. What the synchronizing software cannot do is transfer notes. At the same time notes usually contain quite important details each user will surely be glad to have saved in their phone. I would have also appreciated a smaller font option in the calendar, because the available standard font size allows only relatively short text to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager is very simple. You only have to enter a task, time of completion and priority. Once the task has been completed, you can mark it off. Notes are organized on the same principle. Unfortunately, here the monstrously big font and needless graphic elements are even more annoying than in the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Notes preview ? note detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My remarks about the alarm clock hold also true for the voice recorder application. What strikes me is that individual records can be no more than 1 minute long, even if Nokia N70 has 30 MB of internal memory and an additional memory card.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Pros: Support for Microsoft Office and PDF formats Cons: These are viewers, not editors ? Too much wasted space on the display ? Documents cannot be displayed horizontally</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among pre-installed programs there are three icons with the prefix Quick. These are browsers for formats of the Microsoft Office package. Quickword opens Word text documents, Quicksheet - Excel tables and Quickpoint - Powerpoint presentations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original versions of these programs are full-featured. This means that they not only read documents, but can also edit them or create new ones. The applications delivered with Nokia N70, however, are only able to read. It is not that bad, of course, but if you want to be able to do something more than read an email, you will have to pay extra. The entire Quickoffice Premier package costs 50 dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Work with documents in Microsoft Word causes certain delays before the documents are fully displayed. Even though the program opened the first page, when I tried to go to the second one, it started to behave somewhat unpredictably. The important thing however is that no matter what size or type of Word file I would select, the phone managed them all. Yet I regret that the documents are not shown across the entire display, which is occupied by the needless titles and status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia press release in Quickword </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The spreadsheet viewer shows information across the entire display and offers therefore more details. It is also quicker. Bigger files are viewed almost immediately. But as with Quickword, the information is in read only. Quickpoint is the third application that opens presentations, but it features lower compatibility compared to the first two programs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> This article's table displayed in Quicksheet </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can expect, the PDF viewer is the slowest. Even though it does take time before a whole page gets displayed, the effort is worth making, for the result is identical to the image you will get in Adobe Reader on the PC. Files are opened across the entire display. The browser offers various zoom options too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> PDF viewer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one thing all the mentioned programs lack - the horizontal view option. To blame for this inconvenience is the Symbian Series 60 OS, whose current version does not support horizontal rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among offered office functions you will also run across various applications for work with Bluetooth printers. As I do not have such a printer, I did not try the InfoPrint program, nor did I print pictures. As for the calculator, it is as simple as usual - it manages basic operations; but does not work with precedence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;3 + 4 × 5 = 35 - is that right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: Built-in MP3 player and radio - Stereo everywhere ? New MP3 application called Music Cons: No jack for common earphones ? MP3 files do not continue from the moment of the interruption ? No RDS for the radio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 uses the new Music application as a MP3 player, instead of the old RealPlayer. I won't go in details about the new music player, I would only mention one unpleasant feature of Music: once you have accepted a phone call, the playing file does not continue from the moment it was interrupted. In general, however, Music is better than the older application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Music application </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is delivered with white plug-in earphones. To be honest, this is not my favourite type of earphones, mainly because of their inflexible cable, which seems as if it is going to keep the curves it got when bent in the factory forever, but also because of cable's denticulation - if a man is not shaved, it scratches their beard so loudly that they can hear the result in their ears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the earphones is good and meets all expectations. Even though the common "plugs" do not transfer the bass elements properly and they accentuate all other frequencies, I am able to stand them in my ears. For a better sound you will need to buy an adapter, which conducts a slot for the jack (where standard earphones can then be plugged) from the Pop-port. The earphones can be used as a handsfree set too. On the pip that hangs from the cable there is a microphone and a button for accepting phone calls. If you press and hold this button, the voice dialling gets activated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, Nokia has installed a radio in this smartphone. Earlier, the only Series 60 phones that could offer a radio were the first N-Gage model, the cheap 3230 and the 6260 clamshell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N70's radio is of the "Visual" type. It is prepared for simultaneous parallel data broadcasting and common radio broadcasting, but this service is currently only available in Finland. Anyway, the radio in Nokia N70 allows for listening to common FM broadcasting. The signal quality varies from station to station and is generally worse than the quality of the MP3 player sound. As usual, the cable of the earphones substitutes the antenna, so it is possible that a single move of your body can affect the radio signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Radio is playing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: EDGE and 3G support ? Preinstalled Opera browser ? Data profiles are easy to set up ? Free PC Suite Cons: It does not signal the presence of EDGE in the net ? No infrared</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get connected to internet, you will find out that Nokia N70 is probably the best equipped mobile phone ever. It works with GPRS Class 10 and EDGE Class 10. In addition, it supports third-generation networks in the WCDMA standard. Unfortunately, I did not try out data transferring via 3G. I do not have exact proofs about EDGE either. The problem is that Nokia does not alert you, when EDGE is available. As a result, the user has no idea, whether he is connected through GPRS or through the faster EDGE. The situation changes when 3G come into the play, for its symbol gets clearly displayed.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In the phone alone you can make use of data for the email browser, to send MMS, send instant messages in the Chat application and for surfing the net. What's more, the menu does not offer one, but two browsers: the standard Nokia browser and the superb Opera. I think my words are more than clear about which one of the two browsers is better. Opera is a very good browser for any Symbian phone, especially when you do not have to pay for it. It offers extensive setup options and supports fullscreen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Nokia browser and three times Opera </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to MMS and emails, a data profile for internet or WAP connection can be set in the SettingWizard application.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connecting to the net from a PC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is connected to a computer through a USB cable (delivered with the phone) or through Bluetooth. The absence of infrared port has already become a matter of course. Yet it is a pity, for the infrared connection has proven to be the most reliable and has always been the last rescue solution when other types of connection fail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Bluetooth setup</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I measured the Bluetooth transfer speed between N70 and a computer: 1 MB is transferred in 24 seconds. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connection setup through Bluetooth is easy to establish in all Series 60 smartphones. The connection I got was stable. During the downloading process I measured an average of 82 kb/s, which I believe was EDGE, even if a bit slow. The most important thing is that data connection gave good results, which was the point of the whole test. I am really curious about 3G.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Computer interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All present Nokia phones use the one and the same software package for communication with the computer - PC Suite. It is available on the CD, which is to be found in the N70 delivery box. I recommend you, however, to download its latest version from the official Nokia web site. Besides PC Suit, the CD also contains the Nokia Multimedia Factory application, which helps you create MMS in the computer. Let me now list the options PC Suite has to offer:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia PC Suite is free. No matter how reserved we could be about certain options of this software, it is still one of the best programs mobile phones have ever been supplied with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now, I am only browsing Nokia N70's menu to see if I will find a function I have left out by mistake, which is significant and worth mentioning. So here's what I found:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Director: A program for instant creation of video clips from video records. It adds music and has simple editing options. The result can then be sent in a MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The director creates an impressive video clip in no time </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Go to: an old and well-known function, which is a bit useless in modern Symbian phones. Now there are plenty of setup options, which allow a certain key to start a selected application, so the shortcuts in the Go to application seem unnecessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Games: Card Deck is a collection of the best solitaire versions. The aim of the game is to get rid of all cards. Snakes is the famous snake in 3D. In Snowboarding, which is also a 3D game, you will have the chance to ride downhill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Cards and snake </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lifeblog: a mobile diary for the blog fans. I am not completely sure, but I think this time we have been given a real working program, not just a demo version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symantec Mobile Security: antivirus program.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is a brilliant phone. We knew it right after we entered its specs in the mobiles catalogue, where N70 occupied the first place among more than 200 evaluated mobile phones. Practical tests only came to confirm its strengths. Similar to other smartphones of the Series 60, Nokia N70 is not a completely new phone, but a natural step forward in a logical developing process. So what are the advantages of N70 in comparison with the forerunner Nokia 6681?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 is great for both work and fun. It is a nice and very well equipped phone, whose initial price is approximately 500 euros. N70 hits the market at a bit lower price than Nokia 6681. What are then its main disadvantages? I mind the way the red button behaves when applications are minimized. Beside that, Nokia can be considered a slow device - just like the other smartphones. I have to also draw your attention to a number of uncorrected glitches and unsuccessful features - for example the alarm clock or the voice recorder. All mentioned weak points are however typical for each smartphone with Symbian Series 60.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If I owned Nokia 6681 or 6630 I would probably hesitate, whether to replace them with N70. The innovations offered by the new Nokia are not that many to give reason for such a change, unless one feels like having a new nice toy. As for older phones, replacement definitely makes sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So which one is it better to buy today - Nokia N70 or Nokia 6681? The first model costs ?500, the second one - ?450. I am sure the decision will be difficult, but to me the innovations coming with N70 are worth the higher price.</paragraph>
