			<paragraph>Nokia has prepared an excellent new phone, which is not only attractive, but also well equipped with modern capabilities. At a pretty competitive price you get a black-silver clamshell with two top-class color displays, automatic opening system, a megapixel camera, radio, a MP3 player, a memory card slot, Bluetooth, EDGE, and a detailed menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It was with Nokia 6101 when Nokia stopped to experiment with clamshell phones, having stuck to the path of the proven success ever since, that is, less extravagance, good equipment, and reasonable price. The new Nokia 6131 is another step within the trend described above. Its features, however, are a class higher than usual. The phone features a brilliant display, original and purely elegant design, detailed functions, and intuitive control. Nokia 6131's qualities are so extensive that they can easily make any Nokia 6230 owner consider a possible replacement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp; Nokia 6131</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black Nokia 6131 will probably become popular among men, while ladies are expected to be fond of the white version of the phone. Design is universal and non-obtrusive. Many users will surely like it, no matter how boring it may seem to "cool" teenagers, for example. Nokia 6131 features great capabilities at a very reasonable price, which is a combination guaranteeing sure market success.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design: it only seems flat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have been delivered a black version of the new Nokia 6131. It is made of matt and soft plastics. It is pleasant to touch. Fingerprints remain invisible. Phone's only decoration is the glossy area surrounded by an expressed silver frame on the front, encompassing the external display, the camera and the manufacturer logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Front cover is decorated with a pronounced glossy frame </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top half of the phone gets thinner from the joint towards the edge, which is an interesting design solution as it makes the whole device look thinner too. Hardly anyone would ever say that the joint level of Nokia 6131 is 20 mm thick. At first sight the phone looks like yet another razor thin phone, no pun intended. Its length and width are average, 92 and 48 mm. Weight is a bit higher than usual (112 g), but in no case can it be considered a downside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   The top part's edge does not reach the bottom part's one... </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of Nokia 6131 is shorter than bottom one, creating an interesting optical effect when the phone is closed. The visible part of the bottom part is chromium-plated and thus goes well with the front cover decorative frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  ...so the chromium-plated edge of the keypad is visible from the front </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear side of the phone is purely black. The removable back cover is elaborated of rough plastic material and resembles leather. It is softer than usual, does not catch fingerprints, and provides for a great grip. What's more, it does not creak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Feels perfectly into one's palm ? comparison to a CD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Somewhat unusually, the Pop-port connector is located on the top edge of the device. It is protected by a plastic cap caught to the phone. Next to the Pop-port connector you will see the connector slot for the new charger, which is smaller than the one used in previous Nokia models. The strip eye-let is mounted in the left top corner of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rear cover surface resembles leather ? Pop-port and the memory card slot are located under the rear cover ? Pop-port hidden under the protecting cap and the charger connector right next to it ? Strip eye-let</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Construction: push the button<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone there is a pair of volume control buttons, while on the right side you will find the On/Off button and the camera activation key. Lateral elements are quite small and thus somewhat difficult to recognize by touch, which is particularly inconvenient when earphones volume levels need to be adjusted. Getting used to it takes some time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Nokia 6131's lateral sides </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera activation key is rather sensitive. It reacts to every slight press instead of a long press. I often run into it when I open or close the phone starting at the same time the camera application by mistake. If I get mistaken when the device is closed I have no other choice but to open it and close the camera application. The On/Off button, which also modifies profiles, is useless in such cases as it doesn;t have any function when the camera is on. The external display can be used for taking self-portraits. If you prefer to avoid the difficulties mentioned above, you could optionally lock the keypad, which however leads to the loss of one of the advantages of clamshell construction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 opens in a standard way, that is, by inserting a thumb between both halves. However, on the right side of the phone joint you will see a tiny special opening key, which stands out above the surrounding surface. When you press it on (which requires a certain amount of force), you will hear a click sound and the top part flies out open until it reaches its stop position. To close the phone, simply clap together both halves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Opening key on the right</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has managed to design and manufacture a solid phone with good technical qualities. The joint shows an insignificant gap, but is generally solid enough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: a little actor playing great theatre<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with two brilliant displays. The main one features a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels on a surface of 34 x 44 m and a color scale including 16 millions color nuances. As you can suppose, it is an active TFT display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external display is even more interesting because, unlike other manufacturers, here Nokia has not been thrifty at all. The external display is also a TFT active one. It offers a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels on a surface of 21 x 27 mm, which is a combination that guarantees an incomparable detailed visualization. The external display shows 262K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Both displays are brilliant</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia deserves a compliment for having made a full use of the external display. In many other clamshell phones the external display is usually looked upon as a rather decorative element, with practical application being more or less a marginal feature. In Nokia 6131 its potential has been put to good use. The external display is comfortably legible even when not illuminated, which means that no missed call or received message remains unnoticed. When in stand-by mode, the display shows time, carrier name, profile name, a bar with state icons and signal &amp; battery indicators. When music is being played, the display shows the name of the current song. When the phone is ringing, caller's picture (of course, if such has been assigned to the respective contact) appears in full-screen mode as well as their name and number. Feel free to place a favorite picture as background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  External display on stand-by ? Unsuitable wallpaper may make reading difficult ? ringing profile is selected on the smaller display using the On/Off button&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Minimized MP3 player ? setting volume levels ? Jitulka was calling... ? ... but I did not pick up</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only element I see in need of further improvement is the screensaver mode, which gets activated after a minute or so of display inactivity. It shows a digital clock and/or icons of missed events. I would have appreciated a larger font and bigger icons here. Even though the display turns black &amp; white in energy-saving mode, it is perfectly legible, even when non-illuminated. The drawback is that you need to look at it from a close distance as the small font is difficult to read.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad and battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Clamshell constructions are one of Nokia's strengths. The 6131 model is no exception to the rule. The top part features a large display, while the bottom one is occupied by a spacious keypad with big keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys distribution is standard. The four-way navigation key with its confirming central area is surrounded by four functional keys: two context ones, and the classical green and red receivers. The navigation key has been elaborated very well. Its chromium-plated frame stands out above the surrounding surface making touch orientation smooth and easy. The oval middle area of the control key is no harder to control either. Functional keys are not physically separated, but they are large enough not to complicate finger control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp; Keys are large; typing is comfortable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric part of the keypad constitutes of large keys with slight plastic projection. They have a soft, sure, all in all excellent reaction. Keys legends are illuminated in white; backlight intensity is optimal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Backlighting is even and intensive enough </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let me now pass from compliments to critics, the latter being directed mainly at the battery durability. If the device is not switched off at night, the battery needs charging every second day. In my case I would spend daily about 15 minutes in talking, I write a few messages, connect to Internet, listen to music for about half an hour, activate Bluetooth and synchronize twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Battery is rather weak </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interface and control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131's interface is identical to the interface applied in the slider Nokia 6280, which has a similar display and also features a last-generation Series 40 platform. That is why I am going to use several paragraphs from the original review of Nokia 6280.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be organized in four different ways, of which the most interesting is the one including the active stand-by mode, where all favorite applications' icons, music functions, upcoming events from the calendar, and notes appear on the display. Press the vertical ways of the navigation key to roll into visualized items and access fast your favorite functions, the MP3 player, the radio or the calendar (both ways could be assigned a different configuration too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon bar with legend is fully user-configurable. Preferred functions could also be grouped into a standard "Go to" menu or assigned to the four ways of the navigation key and the context keys beneath the display. Additionally, Nokia 6131 is equipped with a voice recognition system and thus allows for assigning voice orders to particular functions without having to provide preliminary records of function names. To activate the voice system press down the button located in the bottom of the left phone side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to" user menu ? active stand-by mode ? once you enter it, it becomes grey ? modification of font color&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's now get back to the main display. The active stand-by mode is practical, but has one crucial drawback: the font has a white contour in order to be visible regardless to background, but at the same time this makes it difficult to read. To my opinion, framing is not that necessary since font color is user-configurable. I eventually managed to get used to Nokia 6131's visualization, so I left the active stand-by function on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do not like it, stick to the standard display, which shows a clock, the operator name, the active profile, and the icon bar. In its very bottom you will see the names of the functions assigned to context keys. You may also want to place a cross with the icons of the functions assigned to the fours ways of the navigation key in the middle of the display. Customizng the menu with graphic themes is of course available. Nokia 6131 offers 7 graphic themes. Additional ones can be downloaded from the Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> You can place a cross with the functions assigned to the navigation button's ways ? or a simple wallpaper</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Font size is subject of configuration. Inside the phonebook there are two font options, while in the message application and the Internet browser you can choose out of three. The largest font is truly large; on the other hand the smallest one permits you to see an entire SMS en bloc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Various graphic themes applied in the menu </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, Nokia 6131 is perfectly user-configurable including the structure of the main menu, which can be organized in four ways: as a list, as a table, as a table with legends, and as horizontal tabs. The second option, a plain table without legends, permits the visualization of 12 icons en bloc, and is probably the most space-saving one. Icons can be additionally modified, just like in any other of the other three options. The icons in the main menu are elaborated well, but loose details and sharpness when they are about to get animated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; &nbsp;Four views of the main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 is an exceptionally fast device. Reactions are instant. What's more, you can switch it on without having to insert a SIM card. If you do so, you will be able to use all functions not requiring the presence of a SIM card, like the MP3 player, for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calls: a few practical details<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 works in 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz. Contrary to the slider Nokia 6280, the new clamshell does not support 3G networks. Data transfers are left to the two most popular technologies: GPRS Class 10 and EDGE Class 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Typing a phone number ? dialing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Incoming calls are accepted by opening the device or by a press on the green receiver after the phone has been opened. To deny or silence a call use the lateral volume keys. In other words, when opened Nokia 6131 does not expect a second order but directly connects you to the callers. This system can be found in a number of older Nokia clamshell models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Log items ? dialed numbers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is brilliant and loud enough, no matter if it comes from the earphones or the loud speaker. Bass elements are clearly recognizable; distortion is present at highest volume levels only. Calls are terminated either by a press on the red receiver, or by closing the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 offers 64-voice polyphony for playing MIDI files. Ringtones in the form of MP3, AAC or other "real" files are far more attractive though. The phone also offers video ringing. Yet here sound comes from a video record, so it does not permit attachments of independent sounds. Sound is good and loud enough. A strong but still rather quiet and discrete vibration is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of missed calls appears in a window on the main display. From here you can get to the corresponding log, where calls from the same number are grouped in one item accompanied by the date and the time of the last executed call. The same principle is applied for dialed and received calls as well. Each folder can fit in up to 20 items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that is not everything. Nokia 6131 also offers an entire Calls Log, in which all call types, including multiple tries are organized in chronological order. In the phone you will also find an item called Message recipients, in which names or numbers, to which messages have been sent, are stored. A message reader for sent and received SMS or MMS is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> List of contacts I have sent emails to ? but how many were they?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: more than enough space<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280's phonebook was a true disappointment for many Nokia fans in terms of capacity. Nokia 6131 does not repeat this drawback. Instead of the original 500 contact positions, it offers a whole thousand of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is accessed by a press on the down way of the navigation key (if not configured otherwise). It can be organized in three different views: as a standard list, as a list of names with numbers, or as a list of names with pictures. Search is initiated by typing the first letters of the respective name. Th? phonebook can be ordered and searched either by first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Medium font size ? large font ? a view at a particular number in the phonebook ? a contact with an attached picture</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact name in the phonebook can be assigned a total of 15 fields. Here are some of them: five phone numbers, addresses, text details, a picture, a ringtone, video ringing etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer not to customize each individual contact, you could first organize contacts into groups, which you can then specify by a ringtone and a picture. Individual contact setup is recommendable though. Groups come in handy in the application of ringing profiles, where you can select which groups will be able to reach you and which ones should remain silent. Ringtone properties like type, melody, volume, and vibration, sounds serving Push to talk, messages, and the keypad sounds are configured in the ringing profiles too. Nokia 6131 also offers the so called temporary profiles, in which deactivation time can be setup at the moment of activation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up ringing profile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 is designed to dial numbers under voice orders. It needs no pre-teaching. You only have to long press the corresponding button on the side of the device and pronounce the respective name. The device recognizes it immediately, repeats it with a machine voice and starts to dial. If the required contact has more than one number, Nokia 6131 says out the default one (mobile number, ground line, office number...). If you like to dial another one, you have to select it using the navigation key, after which Nokia 6131 will repeat it. This last option could appear rather inconvenient if the number is selected through the Bluetooth headset, that is, when you prefer not to touch the phone at all. It is quite a pity that number type cannot be selected with an additional voice order. Generally, voice dialing shows excellent recognition skills, errors are committed rarely if ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys from 2 to 9 can be assigned shortcuts. Key number one is reserved for the voice mail, while zero starts the Internet browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages: perfect as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 works with SMS, MMS, emails, and Push-to-talk. In addition, it offers two special types: sound MMS and instant SMS, which appear directly on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Main menu of the message application ? Selecting a new message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison to Nokia 6280, Nokia 6131 features a minor innovation in the SMS editor. In the slider Nokia 6280 messages in the new graphic themes were first typed on a single line, which would get extended to the whole display, if the message was longer. In the clamshell Nokia 6131 the message field is confined within the screen (word wrap) from the very beginning, which looks much better. If you apply the smallest available font size, the display visualizes up to 11 text lines en bloc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Writing a SMS - the beginning ? The heading starts to move in order to let more space for text characters ? The small font permits the display of 11 text lines en bloc</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When asked to type the recipient, you may type their phone number straight away, select it from the phonebook, browse groups, or look it up into the list of people, whom you have recently sent a SMS. The last option is particularly useful as people tend to write messages frequently to a limited group of contacts, which is in this case directly accessible. The editor counts down written characters and informs about the number messages that will be sent. SMS are said to share memory, but we did not manage to prove this information. A limit of 150 pieces is possible as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Received messages ? Delivery reports list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T9 dictionary offers an extensive vocabulary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications about SMS delivery can be activated both individually and generally. They appear on the display for a while and then get saved into the phone memory. The list of delivered messages located in an independent folder called Delivery reports can be deleted at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 features a new version of MMS editor, which shows you the exact content of the message the recipient, is going to receive. So, previews like those applied in older Nokia models of Series 40 are no more necessary. MMS can contain text, a picture, a sound clip, a video record, a business card, and a note from the calendar. Multiple-page MMS are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  MMS editor ? after a picture has been attached ? sound messages are MMS too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in Nokia 6131 is a java application and thus takes longer to start running; it is generally slower and it is not perfectly compatible with the rest of the applications in the phone. The email client copies email addresses from the phonebook and works with attachments. At the same time messages cannot be sent from the email field in the phonebook. This option is available for SMS and MMS only. Automatic download of email message is not available either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Email client's main menu ? received emails ? reading a message </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the email client cannot be considered bad. It connects to POP3 and IMAP4 servers, downloads messages, views them; it saves attachments and views supported formats after the email client has been exited. Plain text is sent seamlessly as java applications co-work with the phonebook well and typing email addresses becomes unnecessary. Things get complicated when attachments enter the game as these are limited to 100 KB. In other words, a photo in full resolution is impossible to send.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Time organizer and office applications: long live large displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alarm clock is repeated. Alarm days as well as the repeated alarm interval are user-configurable. Nokia 6131 will wake you up with a standard peep sound, with any sound from the phone memory, or with radio signal, provided earphones are plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the alarm clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar application has benefited significantly from the display enlargement and its higher resolution. Its month and day views can now be viewed simultaneously, including details like month, week, week days... The week view has similar characteristics: in the top part of the display you will see bars with individual days and times, while in the bottom area is located the correspondent day view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Month view of the calendar ? week view ? day view ? event detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers 5 types of events: meeting, call, birth date, note, and reminder. The last one, the reminder, is used for fast inserting something that has to be reminded of soon. In other mobiles you often need to use the "meeting" option as a reminder one, which unnecessarily complicates things. Reminder in Nokia 6131 includes the following details: subject, place, starting date and time, end date and time, reminder date and time, reminder type, repetition (never, daily, weekly, every two weeks, monthly, and annually). Note alias synchronization is missing, which is a pity as it may create difficulties with meetings already planned in Outlook. Meeting place is downloaded into the phone during synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Modifying events </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Task list is simple. Here you can only add a subject, a priority, a term, and a reminder type. Accomplished tasks can be marked off. List items can be ordered in alphabetic order or by deadline. Tasks are very easy to transfer into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are quite handy, because they get synchronized with PC, which allows for longer texts to be downloaded into the phone. Font size is not configurable. Yet, in my opinion it is the text notes where three font size options would have been really helpful (just like in the SMS application). I have the same mark regarding font size in the task list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 is equipped with a voice recorder, which makes records with a 5-minute maximum duration. This limit is quite surprising as in Nokia 6280 voice record duration depended on the available free memory only. Whether data will be stored into the internal memory or onto the memory card is up to your will. Nokia 6131 uses AMR format, a one-minute record occupies approximately 100 KB of memory. Here Nokia engineers could have designed the upper button on the left side of the phone to start the voice record. Instead it has been assigned to the Push to talk function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu also has a countdown option, a stopwatch for lap and meantime measuring. In the java applications there is a unit &amp; rate converter, a world time clock, and a calculator. The latter is quite detailed, offering not only standard mathematic operations, but also work with powers, square roots, reciprocals, functions, the number pi, and memory functions. Yet, the calculator ignores common operator priority. The last application worth mentioning is the so called Sensor, which serves for communication through Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Unit converter ? World time ? Smart and at the same time stupid calculator </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple music application and multimedia functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though music files can be directly played either from the memory, or from the memory card (respective folder is selected in the music player application), it is more convenient to transfer music into the phone using Nokia Audio Manager, which is a part of PC Suite. Here you can create playlists and transfer music straight into the mobile device through a USB cable. However, if you possess larger music library, of more than thousand songs, for example, work with Nokia Audio Manager will probably turn into a never-ending suffering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MP3 or AAC(+) player integrated in Nokia 6131 is rather simple. All options are controlled through the use of three keys: start/stop, fast forward and next track. If you minimize the player, the name of the currently running track appears on the active stand-by display. From here you can also move straight to the next song and even fast forward. Repeating and shuffle options are available too. When music is played with the device closed, the name of the current song and the artist appear on the external display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Music player ? detailed playlist </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones delivered with the Nokia 6131 are a standard pair of plugs of average quality, which go into the Pop-port. I recommend music fans to get themselves an adapter in order to be able to plug in their own set of earphones. I myself tested Nokia 6131 with a pair of Sennheiser HD212 Pro and I remained quite satisfied. The phone is also equipped with an equalizer to help balance sound properties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Earphones delivered with Nokia 6131</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones have a microphone, a key for call accept/skip a song, and a couple of smaller volume control keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: in case that you decide to get yourself an earphone adapter, you may run into a problem with Nokia Music Pack as this comes together with a memory card of the MMC type, while Nokia 6131 uses microSD. That is why you may need to buy an adapter separately. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video in Nokia 6131 is played within an application called Media Player, which also supports streaming. I tried to convert a movie into MPEG4.3GP format and it worked out well. Nokia 6131 played it across the entire display, with the legends Back and Pause being the only disturbing visible elements. The Media Player is not capable of fast forwarding videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your multimedia data is not limited to the internal 10 MB memory. It can be extended with the help of microSD memory cards, which can be hot-swapped meaning that you can change them without turning off the device. Just remove the rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   First remove the rear cover, and then insert the memory card </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Memory manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the music player, switch on the FM radio. Here you can save up to 20 broadcasting stations. In general, however, it does not offer any special functions, not to mention RDS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: colors can hardly improve quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 is equipped with a megapixel camera. The maximum offered resolution is 1280 x 1024 pixels. Lower resolution as well as three types of compression quality is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Camera viewfinder ? setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone displays images vertically. Common pictures are taken horizontally, using the corresponding lateral button, which is not a bad solution at all. The difficulty lies in the menu as it does correspond with the horizontal shooting mode. In result, pictures in the phone gallery are viewed vertically anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 offers a double digital zoom, a night mode, a self-release timer, and color effects. White balance is automatic only, which sometimes results into photos of various color nuances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos in full resolution: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results are rather satisfying in good weather</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; White is always different</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Detail scanning is a time-wasting activity</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The less the light, the more the noise</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Significant lack of light results into unbearable noise levels (night mode)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture quality is average, which is standard for a megapixel photo mobile. Image colors are surprisingly deep, a characteristic that may make pictures look more attractive or, just the opposite, quite unnatural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Pictures in the gallery ? Visualization across the entire display ? printing options &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video records are available, of course. The highest available resolution is QCIF, that is, 176 x 144 pixels. The quality of Nokia 6131 video is average.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fun and Internet: Sudoku in a flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 supports Java 2.0. The phone features 2 pre-installed games: 3D Snake and 3D football. Both feature interesting graphics, but disappoint when it comes to amusement. The phone also hides a third game, which demonstrates the strengths of the Flash format. Yes, that's right: Nokia 6131 plays flash animations in SWF format. The phone also offers a flash video guide as well as the so popular Sudoku in three levels of difficulty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Games list ? Sudoku ? 3D football&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another source of entertainment is Internet. You can browse both WAP and simple Internet pages. The phone browser is simple, with three font size options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Internet browser of Nokia 6131 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6131 can also serve as a modem for establishing Internet connection from PC. The phone gets connected to a PC through Bluetooth, via the Infrared port, or by USB cable (which is not included in the delivery package). Connection parameters can be configured manually, but you will save time if you use the Internet connection program from PC Suite, where you only have to select a modem (for example Nokia 6131 USB, which gets created automatically), choose the preferred operator and press on the corresponding button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you already have PC Suite on your computer, you don't need to install anything else. Nokia uses same program in all its current models.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>One of the best clamshells ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the very beginning I was pretty reserved towards Nokia 6131. I did not like its look. What's worse, I considered it to be another standard clamshell. During the tests, however, when I was using Nokia 6131 as my only personal mobile, the phone convinced me of its exceptionality. It turned out however that it offers a huge amount of features, like elegant looks, two displays of exceptional quality, and a whole lot of "user-friendliness" at a very moderate price. The menu is organized logically; functions are detailed, offering high control comfort and brilliant work efficiency. In this aspect, Motorola engineers should take some notes as their new Motorola V3i is far behind Nokia 6131 (both phones are similar in terms of features, specifications and price).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, Nokia 6131 suffers certain drawbacks too. First of all, it is its weak battery; then it is the low camera picture quality, the simplicity of the multimedia player, the unsuitable font used in the active stand-by mode, and the oversensitive camera key.</paragraph>
