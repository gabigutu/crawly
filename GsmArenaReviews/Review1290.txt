			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Today, we have the AT&amp;T Samsung Galaxy S II at the start line. Out of the U.S. trio of power- droids, it comes closest to the original, having kept its slim line and measurements, while changing its face in a subtle fashion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since its launch a few months back, the Samsung Galaxy S II has become the performance benchmark for an Android smartphone. The I9100 achieved this by trouncing every competitor in terms of specs, performance, and style, and prompted us to call it the ?brightest star? in our review back in May. The title we gave it has been well justified since then, as the phone recently reached 10 million units sold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs of the AT&amp;T Galaxy S II are identical to the I9100, promising us the same mind-blowing performance. The Super AMOLED Plus screen is yet to be bettered by the competition, and so is the Exynos chipset of the droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the bar set so high already, it is time to see if the AT&amp;T Galaxy S II will live up to the high expectations set by its I9100 DNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can probably notice in this section, with the AT&amp;T Galaxy S II, Samsung has stuck with the philosophy that things should not be changed, unless they can be made better. In the case of the hardware, there has been no necessity to do so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don?t be surprised if this review sounds somewhat familiar to you. Like we mentioned above, the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T is almost an identical copy of the I9100, save for the button arrangement at the front of the device. Following now, is the hardware inspection of the droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The retail package has a notable omission<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II comes in the standard orange-colored AT&amp;T box, which is quite compact. Inside, along with the phone, you will find a wall charger, a USB cable, and AT&amp;T booklets. An MHL adapter is also to be found in the package. Oddly enough however, headphones and microSD card are notably missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While a lot of people these days are opting for aftermarket headphones to go with their smartphones, we believe that, for a premium smartphone and its retail package, they are a must have. Same goes for the microSD card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of measures, the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T mirrors the I9100 with 126 x 66 x 8.9mm. Compared to the I9100, the U.S version has put on 5 grams of weight. At 122 grams however, it would still qualify as light, given the set of features which it offers you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to its sibling for Sprint Wireless ? the Epic 4G Touch, the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T is a lot more pocket friendly. You should keep in mind though, that the CDMA Galaxy S II has a bigger 4.5? screen, along with a battery, rocking the impressive 1800 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plastic is the dominant material in the construction of the droid, but this is not a bad thing. Similarly sized, metal clad droids tend to be much heavier, so we are willing to compromise in this department. Besides, there is just enough metal in the device to give it a premium look along with its entire front being adorned by Corning Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3? Super AMOLED Plus of the smartphone is nothing short than a thing of beauty. Since its launch in the I9100, the unit has become the one to beat in the industry. Interestingly enough however, we are yet to see a better one on the market. You can find more about its performance here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, much like with all the U.S. bound Samsung droids, you will find four touch-sensitive buttons. Gone is the hardware button of the original Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the 2MP front-facing camera unit are located in the area above the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II features the volume rocker. The volume keys double as zoom lever in camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, all there is on the right is the power key. A dedicated camera key would have been a welcome addition. We find virtual shutter keys to be less than ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is located on the top of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port at the bottom is used for both data connections and charging. Not only does it support USB host but it also comes with MHL enabling HDTV-out connectivity with the proper adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MHL is a way of using both microUSB and HDMI through the same port. It makes sense, especially provided an HDMI port could?ve been near impossible to put in a phone this slim. The downside is you need an adapter to use a regular HDMI cable with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece completes the bottom of the droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the AT&amp;T Galaxy S II is where the 8 megapixel Full HD-capable camera lens is located. Right next to it is the LED flash, which will probably see more use a flashlight and video-light than a still-camera assist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grille is also on the back of the device. It is located on the slightly elevated chin at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the paper thin battery cover reveals the SIM compartment, the 1650 mAh battery and the microSD card slot. The card slot can take microSD cards of up to 32GB, which can give you a maximum total storage of 48GB. The bad news is the memory card isn?t hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1650 mAh battery made it easily through a day of heavy usage. In case you are not a smartphone junkie, you might be able to squeeze out an extra day out of your Galaxy S II. Such performance is in line with the current offerings on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T is a pleasure. The textured plastic prevents accidental drops, while the slim body allows you single-handed use despite the relatively large size of the body.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Gingerbread and the latest TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T runs Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread, wrapped in Samsung?s own TouchWiz UI. The latest version of the launcher, like we?ve told you before, is nothing short of impressive. We have prepared a video of it in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes in TouchWiz 4.0, compared to its previous versions, begin at the very lock screen, which you can now remove by swiping in any direction, rather than just sideways. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is still here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has become evident, that the AT&amp;T version of the Samsung Galaxy S II suffers a lockscreen security glitch. More about it, along with the remedy, can be found right here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen got plenty of tweaks too. You get rectangular design for the widgets and a lot of functionality. The process of adding widgets is visually enhanced too with attractive transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual ? you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregate view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the proprietary Samsung widgets allow you to edit them directly on the homescreen. We find this feature to be particularly neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is improved as well. You can now create folders inside it (though given that folders are enabled on the homescreen we don?t see much use for that here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is pretty easy stuff ? in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, but there aren?t any major changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager, which Samsung has preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. Now, with 1GB or RAM and with the new Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn?t hurt having it. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications straight on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Exynos chipset doing its magic inside, the overall user experience is pretty smooth on the Galaxy S II. For more on this, join us on the next page, where we?ll take a closer look at the dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU and the Mali-400MP GPU and their performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>CPU performance: still better than everything except?another Galaxy S II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Exynos 4210 chipset is where the Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T gets its special powers from ? just like the I9100. With a couple of Cortex-A9 cores, clocked at 1.2 GHz, and a Mali-400MP GPU to go with a healthy gig of RAM, this phone is nothing short of a benchmark monster. We?ve run a few benchmarks and the results are unsurprisingly good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are no different in with the browser benchmarks as you will see below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Exynos chipset is still faster than anything else on the market. With higher clock speed versions of it in the Samsung pipeline, we suspect that its dominance will continue.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook does it all as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have moved a few things around but the phonebook is pretty much the same as it was in the original Galaxy S. It has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One odd thing we noticed is that the Samsung Galaxy S II cannot display SIM contacts ? there?s simply no setting for that. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can?t display them alongside the phone memory entries. We?ve seen that on other high-end phones as well (cough, iPhone 4, cough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you?ve created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too ? swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too. If you don?t need that, you can still opt for the phonebook to augment your existing contacts info with stuff downloaded from the social network cloud .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard ? one displays the person?s contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff ? status updates and the contact?s online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony, voice commands really work too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T had great in-call quality and the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn?t suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would naturally break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also available ? a double tap on the Home key activates voice commands. All you need to say is ?Hi Galaxy? and speak your command (e.g. ?text Dexter?). Or ?play? and off it goes. It takes a second to launch voice commands but the coolness factor makes it well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s worth noting that this is a third-party app and not the standard Google service ? it?s actually better than what regular Android has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fully covered as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger ? as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of text entry, the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T offers you a whopping three options out of the box. First, you have the standard Samsung QWERTY keyboard, which offers very big and comfortable keys. In landscape mode, the keyboard takes up most of the display and the even bigger keys make it one of the most comfortable virtual mobile keyboards around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the above choice, you have the stock Android keyboard at your disposal, as well as Swype. All in all, you have a keyboard for every mood and occasion. Plus you can download more off the Android Market ? there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser are there for you<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two-finger tilt zoom works much like the name suggests. You touch the screen with two fingers and s sson as you start tilting it, it will zoom in or out according to the tilting motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image and video editors are at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You also get an image editor and a video editor preinstalled. The image editor handles the basics like image rotation, cropping (no resize though) and adjusting brightness/saturation/contrast. You can also make selections (using a smart tool similar to the Quick selection tool in Photoshop). It?s not nearly as accurate as the Photoshop tool though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can apply effects too but the one feature that caught our eye was Context fill ? similar to Photoshop?s Context-aware fill tool but, again, not nearly as accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video editor lets you arrange multiple clips (or photos) and music on a timeline and create a new movie to share. There are several presets, which change the look and feel of the final cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty basic but you can trim videos, split them, change the transition between scenes, apply effects and a few other tricks, to turn you into a pocket Spielberg.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz-ed music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has a lot to give<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (adjust them back or forth a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it ? starting with WMV through AVI (DivX and XviD) and MP4 to MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn?t a problem either ? the Samsung Galaxy S II played Full HD files just fine. Large files of over 2GB worked as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 8MP camera doesn?t disappoint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash but nothing in the way of lens protection or physical shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls by default but the good news is that you can pick four shortcuts to put there ? commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Samsung Galaxy S II offers pretty much everything ? touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, digital image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. There are other features too; we?re only listing the most interesting ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images captured with the 8MP camera of the Galaxy S II are very good ? low noise, plenty of fine detail and the color and contrast are good too. Colors are a smidge oversaturated but that?s how we like them. Keep in mind that the camera has a wide-angle lens ? our measurements suggest a focal length of about 30mm in 35mm equivalent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For comparison photos between the Galaxy S II, Sony Ericsson Arc and LG Optimus 2X you can check out our recent Head-to-head article.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video camera is up to all tasks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The video camera can record video using the front facing camera too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Full HD videos are top-notch, full of detail, low in noise and generally, nice and smooth. There?s plenty of information (bitrate is over 17Mbps) and the only drawback you might consider is the mono audio recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One annoying thing we noticed about the video camera is that it starts to focus only after it has started recording ? that means the first second of every clip is out of focus. We really hope that would be fixed in a future software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peculiarity is that when shooting Full HD videos you have a narrower field of view than that of the still camera. Perhaps Samsung are using the same trick as Apple in the iPhone 4: the camcorder uses only the center of the 8MP sensor instead of shooting with the whole surface and having to scale it down to 1080p putting extra strain on the CPU. In 720p video capture mode however Samsung are making use of the whole sensor and as a result you have the same wide field of view as the still camera (about 30mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means for the occasional videographer is 720p videos might turn out the better option in low light as the process of pixel binning used for downsizing the information captured from the 8 megapixel sensor down to 720p actually benefits the suppression of digital noise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The longer focal range in 1080p mode also makes for a shakier video so you might want to look for a support for your hand while recording to get the best out of the Samsung Galaxy S FullHD camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder features continuous autofocus, which is smooth though a bit slow at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than those peculiarities, the video quality is very good at 1080p ? the .MP4 files come with 17Mbps bitrate and have a lot of detail. The framerate is quite consistent ? there are no dropped or duplicated frames. Keep in mind that Full HD videos gobble up a lot of storage ? a minute of video will easily top 100MB of file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are nice and smooth too, but obviously short of the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few videos Samsung Galaxy S II for you to enjoy. The last one was shot in 720p resolution, while the first one is in 1080p (don?t forget to select 1080p mode when playing it and certainly open it full screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity will overwhelm you with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T starts off with the basics ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G (T-Mobile?s AWS band is missing though). There?s HSPA+ with 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which some carriers brand as ?4G? even though it?s technically not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there?s Bluetooth 3.0 with High Speed, which promises transfer speeds up to 21Mbps. Wi-Fi Direct is a similar technology, which offers simple pairing of two devices but blazing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also NFC support too. We have the strange suspicion that the NFC chip might be integrated into the battery as it carries the NFC sign.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There one is included in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy S II screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T propel it to great heights of user experience. The large, sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum ? that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful dual-core CPU (and probably some GPU acceleration) enables the Galaxy S II browser to play 1080p Flash video embedded on webpages. That was truly impressive stuff ? a lot of netbooks would choke on something like that. You can play touch-optimized Flash games without a hitch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung offers you a couple of Hubs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hubs are not just for Windows Phone 7 ? Samsung, at least, seems to think so. They?ve added two Hubs to their Android super phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we?ve seen before ? it combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Hub lets you buy or rent movies or TV shows. Its interface is neat and intuitive, while its setup will take you no time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is an office editor for the overly productive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes with Quickoffice preinstalled. It?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a YouTube app although it?s really irrelevant here. It cannot match the resolution the in-browser flash player can give you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Don?t go anywhere without Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and powerful new graphics, the Galaxy S II can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.4 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After its recent major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go not only for apps and media, but also books, movies, etc. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Kies Air turns your phone into a web server<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer?s web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone ? from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who?s connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: You?ll need a reasonably modern browser with Java and some video plug-in (QuickTime worked for us).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the original Samsung Galaxy S II entered the scene five months ago, it blew its entire Android competition out of the water. The race wasn?t even close ? the droid was not in a mood to take any prisoners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, we are still to encounter a faster Android smartphone, made by a company other than Samsung, despite the significant number high-end dual-core offerings released by the competition since then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T is priced at $199.99 with a two-year contract. This is in line with all the current high-end offerings on the U.S. market. Let?s see now, what are the other possible options for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two days from today, the iPhone 5 will finally be officially released. In case you are not stuck with the Android ecosystem, it is an option worth considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of $99 can get you a 3D experience in the face of LG Thrill 4G. The droid is the U.S. version of the Optimus 3D. Its spec sheet is packed with features, but its OS is still Android 2.2 Froyo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Thrill 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Verizon Wireless has just launched the Motorola Bionic. The droid?s spec sheet is quite impressive, including the presence of LTE connectivity on board. We can?t say the same for its design and size. The Bionic is currently being offered at $299.99 with a contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Bionic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sprint Wireless can offer you Motorola Photon, HTC EVO 3D and?Samsung Epic 4G Touch. All three droids are priced at $199.99, have WiMax present, and have feature-packed spec sheets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You probably already know that the Epic 4G Touch is the Galaxy S II version for Sprint. It has a bigger, 4.5? screen and a battery, packing the stunning 1800mAh. All this functionality is packed in a body slightly bigger than the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T has. If CDMA is your thing, look no further, we are sure Samsung won?t mind it if you pick it over the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola Photon ? Samsung Epic 4G Touch ? HTC EVO 3D</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T-Mobile has its own version of the Samsung Galaxy S II coming soon. It will offer you a bigger 4.5? screen, and a dual-core Snapdragon CPU, clocked at 1.5MHz. The droid will be able to reach network speeds of up to 42Mbps. The T-Mobile Galaxy S II will cost 229.99 when launched. This one is worth keeping an eye on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> T-Mobile Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G will offer you similar spec sheet for a slightly higher price (we still can?t explain why). It will be launched simultaneously with the T-Mobile Galaxy S II for $269.99.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Amaze 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally we have the HTC Sensation 4G and T-Mobile G2X as well. Keep an eye on the latter as it already received the Gingerbread update, and transformed itself into a serious droid. The U.S. version of the LG Optimus 2 costs $149.99 with a contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> T-Mobile G2X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation 4G on the other hand, will likely have its price dropped from the current $199.99, once the Amaze 4G is out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the above options will not disappoint you. They won?t however offer you the Galaxy S II experience, save for, well, the other two Galaxy S II models, which we listed above. It?s been five months already since the first Galaxy S II came to the market and, we can attest, its AT&amp;T sibling is a winner just like the original.</paragraph>
