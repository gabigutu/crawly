			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5 is gone for good, abandoned and replaced by the fresh iPhone 5c. Initial rumors erroneously suggested that the lowercase letter stands for cheap, but it turned out that the Cupertino-based giant had color on its mind instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the first time ever Apple broke pattern and released not one, but two new iPhones this year. The successor we all knew was coming - the iPhone 5s - is joined by the "unapologetically plastic" iPhone 5c, meaning that we no longer get last year's flagship as the second best iPhone on tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, the Apple iPhone 5c stands as basically an iPhone 5 in a shiny new outfit that comes in a number of bright colors. And, if you think about it, that's the most logical thing to do - the colorful iPod lineup has been getting lots of praise on account of looks so it was about time Apple's smartphones got the same treatment. The iPhone 5c is so keen on showing how young and fresh it is, that the traditional black is not among its five paint jobs (white, blue, yellow, green and pink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a catch though. The Apple 5c comes with a glossy plastic body instead of the sleek-looking aluminum chassis of the iPhone 5. The reasons for the switch will probably never be officially revealed, but it could be anything from supply issues to budget, to simply aiming to deliver a fresh new look to match the redesigned iOS 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finding the truth is hardly the point here, though. What we are more interested in is whether the company that repeatedly bashed competitors about cheap plastic phones over the past few years has created a plastic phone that you can be proud to be seen in public with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue, here's the Apple iPhone 5c review cheat sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7th iOS iteration brought a long overdue UI overhaul to the iPhone lineup, with Apple keen to demonstrate that the innovation well hasn't dried up. Flat, colorful and with a ton of new features, iOS 7 certainly puts the iPhone 5c in a better position in the smartphone race. Apple is also sweetening the pot even further by giving you the complete iWorks office package, the iMovie video editor and the powerful iPhoto app for free - content that otherwise costs more than $40.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pricing remains the elephant in the room regarding the iPhone 5c, as it slides in just $100/?100 below the iPhone 5s. That's as much as the iPhone 5 would've cost had it not been discontinued and we have yet to see if this is a change for the better or worse. On one hand you are getting a fresh new design instead of one that's been around for almost a year, but on the other, you are losing the premium metal body while still paying the same price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high asking price also sends the iPhone 5c right in the way of the current Android and Windows Phone top-dogs, pushing its (now one-year-old) internals to the limit to keep up. It's certainly a curious starting point and we are excited to see how the iPhone 5c race develops. The unboxing and hardware tour is right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the iPhone 5c<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5c ships in plastic box with a transparent top - the same style as the packages the iPod Touch players come in. The iPhone 5c lays in a plastic holder which needs to be detached before you can use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the smartphone are the usual set of accessories - the new Apple EarPods headset, a Lightning USB cable for charging and connectivity purposes, plus a wall charger. The paperwork includes two Apple stickers plus a SIM ejection tool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5c 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5c has pretty much the same footprint as the iPhone 5 and 5s, but is 1.4mm thicker and 20 g heavier because of its new plastic casing. The phone definitely feels heavier than its 5-series siblings, though you'll probably won't notice the thicker profile because of its tapered edges.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Plastic is back at Apple. It's been gone since 2010 and the iPhone 4's all-glass shell, but it seems there is once again a place for plastic phones in Apple's lineup. The iPhone 5c back is made entirely of glossy plastic and is available in five different flavors - white, green, yellow, blue and pink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is identical to the discontinued iPhone 5 and very similar to one on the iPhone 5s, with the exception of the Home key. Once again there is no official information on the screen's protective glass, but we believe Apple is still using Gorilla Glass as was the case with the previous generation of iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5c looks a lot like the fifth generation iPod Touch players, though it is thicker and made of plastic instead of metal. Unfortunately Apple has opted for glossy plastic and it is quite prone to fingerprints, smudges and scratches. On the bright side, thanks to the bright colors those prints won't be as noticeable as they used to be on the black iPhone 3G and 3GS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5c provides a really awful grip due to its sloping edges, as well as the slippery glossy plastic the entire shell is made of. When you lay the 5c down flat, there is a very good chance it slips through your fingers once you try to lift it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while the glossy materials make for a very slippery shell, the build quality is where Apple would never compromise. The iPhone 5c has an excellent and great construction, with no creeks or squeaks whatsoever. The added weight also contributes to the solid feel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the different chassis compared to its predecessor, the controls are exactly where they were on the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front has the Home key below the display, while the earpiece and the FaceTime camera are above the Retina screen. The proximity and ambient light sensors are hidden near the FaceTime camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, a double tap on the Home key launches the task manager, while a press and hold will start Siri.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the usual three buttons: volume up, volume down and a Mute toggle. All three are made of plastic as well and the mute switch is still rather stiff, so accidental presses are highly unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right you find the tray, which pops open to reveal the nanoSIM slot. You can find the slightly different ejection tool (compared to the iPhone 5/5s one) within the paperwork in your iPhone 5c retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the iPhone 5c hosts the lonely plastic power/lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the iPhone 5c is really crowded. Here we find the 3.5mm audio jack, the microphone pinhole right next to it, the Lightning port for charging and connectivity, plus the loudspeaker grille which consists of four pinholes. The only two screws holding the plastic battery cover are on both sides of the Lightning port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera lens, the secondary microphone for noise cancelation, and the single-LED flash are at the back. The camera is the same used on the iPhone 5, while the new and improved sensor with true-tone dual-LED flash are reserved for the flagship 5s model.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Underneath the back panel lies a non-user-accessible 1,510 mAh Li-Po battery, which is 70mAh more than the iPhone 5 had. This is basically the only department where the iPhone 5c got a minor upgrade. Apple says the battery should last for up to 10 hours of calls or 250 hours of stand-by, quite a bump up from the iPhone 5's promised 8 hours of talk time and 225 hours of standby. We're guessing the iOS 7 update has something to do with that as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional battery test and the iPhone 5c achieved a pretty good score of 52h, which means you'll only need to charge it once every 52 hours if you use it for an hour of talking, web browsing and video playback per day. Of course, your mileage will vary depending on use (calls and video are particularly taxing, whereas browsing endurance is great).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The score is just an hour better than the iPhone 5 results. The 3G talk time and stand-by endurances have been slightly improved, the web browser battery drainage is almost the same, while the video playback has strangely dropped by over 2 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its important to note that the iPhone 5c test unit (along with a couple of iPhone 5 units we have) had major issues with their stand-by. On three different occasions its dully charged battery got drained completely overnight. Here's hoping that Apple finds a fix for this as soon as possible as it's rather irritating to have to deal with this.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 5c fits perfectly in most hands and is very easy to operate, while also being pocket friendly thanks to its compact size. The one thing that bothers us is the poor grip of the smartphone. As we mentioned earlier, you can easily drop the iPhone 5c because of its slippery plastic and not quite ergonomic edges. In the event you opt for this colorful smartphone you should be very careful when you picking it up from flat surfaces, or even as you're taking it out of your pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5c comes with the same 4" IPS LCD screen that premiered with the iPhone 5. It has a resolution of 640 x 1136 pixels, which adds up to a pixel density of 326ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the display offers excellent colors, contrast and viewing angles. Because the front glass reduces reflectivity, sunlight legibility is great too. Just as we expected, the iPhone 5c display turned out to be as good as last year's iPhone 5 screen in our tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And here's how the Apple iPhone 5 display matrix compares to that of its predecessor. You can clearly see both are pretty much the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 5c screen under a microscope vs. the iPhone 5 screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPhone displays have always had impressive image quality, but Apple is starting to fall behind by yet again delaying the release of an iPhone with a bigger display than 4". The company no longer holds the record for highest ppi on a mobile screen, and has even fallen behind in the pixel density race, where 1080p screens rule. Of course the difference between the Retina screen sharpness and that of the best on the market is only evident when you look from way closer than feels natural or comfortable, so we won't be taking any points away for the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size is a bigger issue though and hopefully, next year's release of the iPhone 6 will see an increase in screen diagonal. Otherwise the Cupertino company runs the risk of seeing its market share continue to slip.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5c runs on iOS 7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 brings a major overhaul to the user interface - it has brand-new flat look, transparent menus and keyboard, new system icons and apps, new control center and much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue here is a quick video demonstration of the new iOS 7 running on the iPhone 5c.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 looks a lot different to its predecessor, but its logic of operation is mostly the same. All of your apps are on the homescreen, folders are available and there is the familiar dock that can take up to four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All system icons are different though, the clock now has an animated icon showing the current time, the system fonts have been altered, there are lots of semi-transparent elements and new gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start from the beginning - the lockscreen. It's totally different and yet it works in a very similar way. The slide to unlock bar is now gone and you can swipe anywhere on the screen to unlock your iPhone 5c. The text is somewhat illogically placed right above the tiny arrow for the control center which points up, but you actually still need to slide to the right to access the homescreen. The swipe could've worked both ways, left too, but that's not the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen also has the camera shortcut at the bottom, you can swipe up from there for quick access to the camera app. A double press of the Home key will bring the multimedia controls as usual. Lockscreen notifications are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can notice two transparent arrows at the top and the bottom of the lockscreen. Swiping from the top will display Notifications, while swiping from the bottom will bring up the new Control Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen out of the way reveals the revamped homescreen. The Spotlight pane is now gone - but not lost. It's just triggered by a new pull-down gesture anywhere on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are available as usual, but there is no limit any more on how many apps you can put inside them. Pages are available in the folders, each page can pack up to nine apps and there is no limit on the page count. And you can finally put the Newsstand app away in a folder! Hallelujah!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening and closing of folders is now accompanied by a cool animation. Those do take a bit too long, though, and might become irritating once you are past their wow phase. A cool bit is the folder icons and the folders themselves are semi-transparent and their backgrounds adapt to the background's prevailing color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should have already noticed the semi-transparent dock, folders, keyboard and Control Center in the screenshots. The Notification and Control Center colors are also adaptive, just like the folders, and they'll change depending on the background. So they might be blue-ish on the homescreen, but light gray in the web browser, or dark gray in the settings, or green in the gallery, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is less transparent and has only two themes - very light gray and very dark gray. Of course, they also change depending on whether your keyboard has popped up on top of a light or a dark background. Beside the new theme and font, the iOS keyboard is unchanged, which is not a bad thing as it's certainly one of the most comfortable around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dictation is also available courtesy of Siri. Just hit the dictation button on the left of the space bar and fire away. Keep in mind that the performance may suffer in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes don't end with those transparent and adaptive visuals. Opening an app involves a zoom in animation over the app icon, which is pretty cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is observable throughout iOS 7. Apple designed the new iOS on independent layers - background, homescreen icons, icon badges, app pop-ups. The iPhone then uses its accelerometer and gyroscope to move layers independently and create an illusion of depth. The movement is very subtle. In fact, you might not even notice it if you are not looking for it, but it's there and it looks awesome once you start moving your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is not only available on the homescreen. You can see it in folders and in the pop ups that ask you for passwords or display notifications. Those pop ups by the way are also translucent and adapt their background color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't like the parallax effect you can turn it off from the Accessibility entry in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iOS 7 brings live wallpapers. You can find them in the relevant section of the Wallpaper Settings. Currently there are seven live wallpapers and unfortunately there is no wallpaper section available in the App Store. It seems we'll have to rely on Apple for adding more of those with further iOS updates, which is less than ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might have noticed in all those shots that Apple has ditched the cellular coverage bars and replaced them with five dots. The battery also got a new icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple decided not to follow the competition and put the connectivity toggles in the notification area. They're in a brand new Control Center instead, that's pulled up with a swipe from the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has five non-customizable rows for various shortcuts. The top row has five toggles - Airplane, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DND mode and Rotation Lock. The second row has the brightness slider. Next come the media player controls including a volume bar. The fourth row has AirDrop and AirPlay shortcuts. Finally, at the bottom of the Control Center there are four shortcuts - one that turns on/off the LED flash to serve as a flashlight and three app shortcuts - Clock, Calculator and Camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume slider is perhaps a bit redundant but nothing in the Control Center is customizable. It's a great, and well overdue, addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center has been redesigned as well. It now has three tabs - Today, All and Missed. The Today tab has the date, a summary of all events for the day, calendar day view, reminders, stocks and tomorrow's summary. As usual, you can choose which apps you want to show up in the pull-down Notifications and in what order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Today's tab is customizable, you can disable its elements one by one - everything but the date displayed at the top can be removed so it doesn't get in the way. You can even disable the Today tab altogether in the Notification Center for the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The All tab is basically the notification center of iOS 6 but sans the weather, stocks and calendar events. The first two are now part of the Today tab, while the weather is gone for good. You can disable the All tab for the lockscreen as well (just turn off Notifications View). If both Notifications (All) and Today tabs are disabled, the entire Notification Center won't be available on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Missed tab displays new emails, messages and missed calls, while your iPhone 5c was locked. Those notifications are still available in the All tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handling of notifications hasn't changed a bit. You can opt to disable a notification, set it to be a banner, which will shortly pop up over the status bar or an alert showing up at the center of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to disable badges on app icons or disable lockscreen notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can interact with notifications straight on the lockscreen. If a notification has just arrived, sliding to unlock will open up the relevant app - upon a missed call, you'll go straight to the phone app. You can also swipe a notification to perform a task - swipe to call back or text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The banner notification is very subtle. If you receive a text in the middle of something, it will briefly pop up over the status bar and disappear in a couple of seconds, and not distract from what you're doing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Do Not Disturb is, as expected, still an integral part of the iOS 7. It gives users further control on notifications, or rather their suppression. If turned on, it will mute incoming calls or alerts. You can allow calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval in which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND feature and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Apple, iOS 7 offers multi-tasking for all apps. Previously the true multi-tasking was reserved only for navigation or music streaming apps, the rest had to go in suspend mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this multi-tasking for all apps will surely drain the battery faster than Apple would have liked, so there is a catch. Yes, all apps will work in the background, but the iOS will learn which one of them you use most often and when.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's say you open the Facebook app every morning and don't use it for the rest of the day. The iOS will soon learn that and will optimize the app to work according to your schedule until you change it. This means most of the day and night the app will still be in suspend mode (push notifications will work of course), but the iOS will run Facebook shortly before your alarm goes on and load all the content. That way when you open it, your news feed will be already updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed that apps also update in the background when push notifications come in. This is a part of what Apple calls opportunistic updates - the iPhone waits until a data connection is available and starts the updates then, so it doesn't need to activate the connection on another occasion and waste your battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We haven't spent enough time with iOS to give a proper judgment on how well the new multitasking works, but once we do we'll duly update this article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All apps that use Cellular/Wi-Fi connection and can work in the background are listed under Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Background App refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task-switcher interface is invoked with a double tap on the Home key. It looks a lot like the webOS cards of old and, more recently, the HTC Sense Task switcher - all apps are presented with cards that you can swipe up to close. Each card has the respective app icon so you can easily recognize what's what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multitasking UI works in both portrait and landscape mode, but you cannot see more than three cards at a time. It's one of the limitations of the card interface and we suspect this is why HTC went for a different task switcher on the One, but here's hoping that Apple will at least fix the landscape mode down the line. By the way, you can close all three visible apps on the multi-tasking screen by swiping over all of them simultaneously with three of your fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 Settings menu has the same layout as in previous versions but updated with the new flat and borderless look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the Background App Refresh, the iOS 7 offers even better control over the apps that use mobile data. The Cellular tab offers detailed cellular data breakdown by apps and services, allowing you to properly manage your resources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing worth mentioning is the Vimeo and Flickr integration in addition to Twitter and Facebook. Once you enter your account details in the settings you can upload your photos straight to your Flickr gallery, while your videos will go to your Vimeo. You just need to hit the share key on a picture or a video and use the dedicated Flickr/Vimeo icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last major change about the user interface is the Back gesture available in all iOS 7 default apps (maybe developers will be able to extend the support to third-party apps after launch). Whether you are in settings, App Store, Messages, Notes, Reminders, Safari, etc. a swipe from the left side of the screen will take you one step back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Apple iPhone 5c is running on the last year's Apple A6 chipset. It is a still very snappy smartphone and the iOS 7 runs buttery smooth, as usual. The A6 features a custom-developed dual-core CPU (which shares many of its features with ARM Cortex-A15 CPUs), clocked at 1.3GHz. It matches the scores of most of the quad-core smartphones out there running on the Snapdragon S4 Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, we ran the new Geekbech 3 test to see how the CPU and memory is doing. The iPhone 5c scored the same as the iPhone 5 and exactly half the iPhone 5s scores. As you can see Apple A6 is a good match for the quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro chipsets, but falls behind the Snapdragon 600 and 800 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran the iOS version of Linpack. The iPhone 5c is on par with the iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5s, just as Apple promises, does twice better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After that we did the multi-platform GFX Benchmark. The iPhone 5c has identical results with the iPhone 5 and is on par with the Adreno 320 GPU inside the quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro chipsets powering the last year's droid flagships on the Egypt test, but falls behind them on the T-Rex benchmark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we put the iPhone 5c through the SunSpider and BrowerMark benchmarks to test the Safari's Java Script and overall browsing performance. The iPhone 5, 5c and 5s trio running on the iOS 7 occupied the first spots in our charts, showing that Apple has done a great job of optimizing its browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmark scores are one thing, but what matters more is that iOS 7 runs buttery smooth on the iPhone 5c with no lags or delays. Loading times might be longer than we would have liked with some apps, but the overall experience is very solid.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has been updated with the new iOS borderless look and simple color scheme. The logic behind the phonebook app is completely the same though, there is just one new feature - Blacklist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either add contacts to the blacklist from the Settings menu, or you can simply go to a contact and hit Block this Caller key at the bottom. Once blocked you will no longer receive calls, FaceTime and messages (SMS, MMS, iMessages, emails) from this contact. You can of course unblock them at any time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the phonebook offers Facebook and Twitter integration. After you set up your accounts the phonebook will automatically ask you to link your existing contacts with their social ones (if available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can search via the dedicated Search field at the top of the list of contacts or you can use the alphabetical scroll at the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is intuitive and gives you the option to include lots of additional fields, like several addresses, related people, web, email, birthdays, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set different ringtones, message tones and vibration to your favorite contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since iOS 6 your iMessage and FaceTime ID is joined and the phonebook will automatically detect if either service is available with each contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5c has very good reception and doesn't suffer from any issues with the embedded antennas as some of iPhones of old. The in-call quality is great as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The incoming call and in-call screens have gone flat too. The dialpad itself looks different, though it brings no new usability features. Smart dial is sadly, still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can reject calls via SMS since the last iOS update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the iPhone 5c to remind you to call back a person at a location or when you're leaving the current one, which is a nifty trick. Keep in mind that doing so will invoke constant use of GPS, which could in turn lead to a significantly reduced battery life but the phone would probably still last a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime comes as a system app in iOS 7 and looks just like the Phone app. It works both over a cellular data or Wi-Fi. The service now offers voice calls too, in addition to video conference. With FaceTime audio calls and iMessages, iOS users won't need Viber as much to connect with other iOS users free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we've tested the loudspeaker performance of the new iPhone 5c. Unfortunately, the speaker is no better than the iPhone 5, which gives it a Below Average mark. We suggest keeping the vibration on the whole time otherwise you may miss a call or notification or two in noisier environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New looks for the messaging department<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messages app also gets the new iOS skin. It adds a new option in the conversation view - Contact. If you tap on this key, you'll get options to Call and FaceTime that user, or go to their phonebook profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5 or later running iGadgets over Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages. The iMessage conversations are color-coded to differ from the standard SMS/MMS - their bubbles are blue instead of green. A cool thing about them is that each conversation is synced with the iCloud so you'll have it right there and available on all your iDevices, including your Mac (although synchroniszation is not flawless and the time stamps would get messed up at times).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. Adding multimedia is done either by hitting the small picture icon next to the text field or through the sharing menu in the gallery or supported apps (Voice Memos, Notes, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Mail client has the new looks but the functionality is unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VIP lists are available - emails from people on the list will be delivered to a dedicated VIP mailbox and will appear highlighted in the regular inbox. You can also set a different notification regime for VIP emails - so they appear on the lockscreen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also flag important emails. After you flag your first message, a new Flagged mailbox will appear gathering all of your flagged emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching pictures and videos while composing an email is possible since the iOS 6 - just tap and hold on an empty space and use the popup menu. Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are available in the text editing options, as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold and select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the quote symbols before the text you're quoting. Finally there is a built-in dictionary. It's very rich in content and conveniently works offline.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Completely redesigned Photos app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has been redesigned more thoroughly. To begin with, the Photos tab looks better organized. Prior to iOS 7 we used to get a grid of all of photos there, sorted by date. Images are now organized by date and location, for those that have been geo-tagged. This view is called Moments, with a description always at the top, with time, place and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moments view offers multiple photos selection - you can select an entire folder with just a single tap. Mass Delete, Share (including AirDrop) and Add To Album options are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go a step back, to Collections view where you can better view your sorted photos into groups with labels and much smaller thumbs. Those thumbs are still clickable, you can even scroll them to find the one you're looking for (small thumbs are hard to navigate through though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a city label in Moments or Collections will take you to the old Places view, where you get a map with pins showing where exactly your photos were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Year view. It squeezes your collection into tight grids for each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Shared photos - it has all your Photo streams. Photo Stream, which acts like a social sub-network, works really well and is very simple to set up. You choose what pictures to share and which people to share with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments. You can invite users you want to share your Photo Streams with via email or get invited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the third tab is albums. You get three default album types - camera roll, my photo stream and panoramas. Albums can be added, edited and deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are displayed in full size and you can delete, share or edit them. From the sharing menu you also get advanced options such as copy, assign to contact, slideshow, print, use as wallpaper and AirPlay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can AirDrop multiple pictures from this interface as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo editor is the same as before with a new option to add filters. It supports rotation, cropping, filters and red-eye removal. There's also an Enhance option too. In Edit mode five keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every iPhone 5c and 5s offers you the iPhoto and iMovie apps for free. The iPhoto allows you also to organize your photos by albums and events, you can even create journals - a collage of photos you can share via iCould and make it visible to anyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhoto app has richer editing options than the standard gallery, but its UI needs to be updated to match the iOS 7 looks. Not it just looks a bit retro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the powerful iMovie editor is available for free as well, you just need to download it once you sign in on the AppStore. You can make your own movies and trailers by adding, cutting, merging, etc. videos, songs and pictures. The app is powerful and does an excellent job.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many things have changed in iOS 7 but the video player is definitely not one of them. You can upload only supported formats via iTunes or purchase videos from the iTunes store. This is an extremely disappointing showing by a platform that is supposed to excel at multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of extra functionality is bad enough, but having to use just an extremely limited number of media format or resorting to converting files, which is both slow and inconvenient is a real deal-breaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and iTunes Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 music player is exactly the same as the one in iOS 6, its appearance is in line with the new iOS design. You can create playlists, delete songs right from within the player and reorder tabs whichever way you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cover Flow is gone for good replaced by the new Album view - you access it by flipping the device landscape. It lists all the covers to the albums you have in your library. Tapping on an album thumb lists all the tracks in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen hasn't changed in functionality neither is the settings. Even in its seventh major iteration iOS still fails to offer configurable equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are logged in with a US Apple ID (the service will roll out in more countries soon), your iOS 7 music player will get an additional iTunes Radio tab. It's a music streaming service with the entire iTunes content available for streaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stations are divided by genres, but once you add a station, you can choose to remove artists or add more songs from an artist/group. You can preview a station before adding it to your list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you like a particular song, you can buy it with just one tap. History is available and you can always return to buy songs later. A Wish List is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Radio is ad-free if you are using iTunes Match. Otherwise, every 7 to 10 songs are broken by about 15sec of commercials.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output loud and clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just as expected the Apple iPhone 5c audio output was mostly identical to that of the iPhone 5. The Apple lineup was dethroned as the best in this regard over the past year by some of the Android flagships (most notably the HTC recent top dogs), but the iPhone 5c still performs admirably and will please every audiophile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first trial (connected to an active external amplifier), the iPhone 5c did close to perfectly. The frequency response lacks the deviations at the high end of the spectrum that we saw on the iPhone 5 so the only average stereo crosstalk levels are the only thing that's not brilliant about the smartphone's scores. Volume levels are pretty high too, although not quite as good as on the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second part of our test told a similar story - the iPhone 5c is a great performer with high volume levels and clean output. The stereo crosstalk again isn't the best we have seen, but the rest of the readings are all impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 8MP cam with filters and square photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5c sports the same 8MP camera sensor and LED flash as the iPhone 5. It can take photos with up to 3264x2448 pixel resolution, HDR shots, plus square pictures and high-res panoramas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app has been completely rewritten. There are four modes available - Video, Photo, Square and Pano. There is no dedicated switch for those, you need to swipe to get to the desired camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no image settings besides the flash and HDR toggles, but there are 8 filters with live preview available for the Photo and Square modes - Mono, Tonal, Noir, Fade, Chrome, Process, Transfer and Instant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use filters and take square photos with the front camera as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera supports AF/AE lock as usual with tap and hold on the viewfinder. There are no resolution settings though, nor are there video resolution options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the iPhone 5c delivers shots of similar quality to those produced by the iPhone 5. Those were some of the finest shots from last year with lots of fine detail and great color reproduction. Noise levels are decent, too, though we've seen smartphones do better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two macro shots as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've taken a few shots with an iOS 7-running iPhone 5 for comparison. Those prove the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5 share the same sensor and their output is as close as it gets. You can further explore the quality in our dedicated Picture Compare Tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly the iPhone 5c Panorama mode works greatly and offers seamless stitching and quick processing. Images come out with a maximum resolution of 28 megapixels and are saved in regular JPEG format. The second panorama was shot with an iPhone 5 for you to compare.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder user interface is almost identical to the still camera one. There is a shutter button, a shortcut to the gallery, which transforms into a still capture shutter once you start recording, and there is also a switch for the LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos taken during video recording are 2MP and pretty much useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of actual video capture the iPhone 5c does a great job, as expected. The videos run smoothly, there's a great amount of detail and focusing is fast and accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have a bitrate of around 17Mbps, the framerate hovers around the 29 fps mark, while the mono audio bitrate is 63Kbps. What we find really frustrating is that Apple still doesn't utilize the full potential of the iPhone's microphones and the videos recorded with the iPhone 5c come with mono sound, which is particularly bad considering it has three mics on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a direct download link to a 1080p video sample taken straight off the iPhone 5c. And this is a 1080p video shot with the iPhone 5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Powerful connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5c supports quad-band GSM, penta-band 3G plus lots of LTE bands. CDMA version is available as well. If you want to know more about the different bands and model versions, click here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5c supports dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n. Tethering is supported, too, although it's up to your carrier if you'll be able to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5c offers A-GPS and GLONASS support, just like its predecessor. The smartphone is impressively quick in getting satellite lock, taking just a few seconds on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP support is also onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one new feature in the iOS 7 connectivity department - AirDrop. It's a system-wide file sharing service between supported iDevices. AirDrop needs to have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is available in every share menu throughout the iOS 7. You can send pictures, videos, App Store and iTunes links, Notes, Maps links, all kind of files from file managing apps (i.e. Filer, Flash Drive, Air Disk, etc.), Office docs, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there are people with AirDrop service around you, they will automatically appear in the dedicated AirDrop field. You just mark your files, select people and hit the send key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop won't work with other phones and PCs, but will work on Macs running on OS X Mavericks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regular USB mass storage isn't available but there's a workaround using the iTunes computer software. You can transfer whatever files you want, but those are only made available to the app that you've dropped them onto. Good things is you are not restricted to files compatible with said app and you can simply drag&amp;drop files that you would download on another computer later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can still access your photos with Windows Explorer or Mac's Finder, but there is no access to the file system beyond your camera folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, hardware storage expansion is still out of Apple's policy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple is continually improving its Find My iPhone service. The latest iOS 7 updates it with the so-called Activation Lock. This will not only protect your personal data but also make your iDevice inoperable once wiped unless you enter your Apple ID. This means the stolen or lost iGadgets will be of no use to thieves or finders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud was an integral part of iOS 5 and is present here in iOS 7. It syncs all of your important data between all of your devices running iOS 5 or above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get 5 GB of free storage but you can buy more if you want. Selecting which apps to sync is pretty easy. iCloud even remembers each device you've backed up so you can restore them separately if you wish. You can naturally delete older backups to free up space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has records on exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you've deleted for some reason. Apple keeps tabs on this for each of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did). Here is an example:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say, you have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone. It has a save data of 1.5MB. Apple will sync only this file. If you delete the game and later install it again (free, from the Purchased list), your iPhone will download the original IPA from the App Store and will get back this 1.5MB file too - a lot more natural process to sync an app rather than keeping the whole image. If you use an app as USB storage (Filer or even CineXPlayer), then, by default, the whole content will be backed up too, eating your backup quote quite fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing with the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available and if you have enabled this feature from the AppStore settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has announced a new connectivity mode that will be supported in a wide range of vehicles, starting in 2014 - iOS in the car. You will be able to see your iPhone screen on your compatible car display. And you will be able to control it via your car controls or just tell Siri via your car audio system what it is you want it to do for you on your iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will be able to use navigation, dictate messages, make calls, play music or iTunes radio, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the confirmed car manufacturers to integrate the new service are Honda, Mercedes, Nissan, Ferrari, Chevrolet, Infiniti, Kia, Hyundai, Volvo, Opel, Jaguar and Acura.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New Safari with unified search field<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has finally updated the Safari browser. Yes, it got flat looks and 3D tab switching, but that's just the beginning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll notice is the unified search/address field. It was about time, really. The next long-awaited features are the full-screen view and auto-hide. Open in background handy options premieres as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari finally supports more than 8 simultaneously opened web tabs. We quit trying to reach the new limit (if there is one) at around 22. The tab switching interface is a 3D arc where you swipe a tab left or right to close it. You can rearrange the tabs, you can add new ones or switch to private browsing. It's certainly looks good but it's a departure from the flat design language seen elsewhere on iOS7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch to private browsing, you'll need to either close all current tabs or migrate them to Private as well. It's not possible to have private and non-private tabs open simultaneously like in Google Chrome. When you are browsing in Private mode, Safari switches to a dark gray color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open your History you'll find a new tab called Shared Links. Here you'll find all links from your Twitter timeline, with authors and comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari in iOS 7 supports the iCloud keychain where you can store all of your passwords and credit card info (sans the security code). There is also a password generator available, in case you are out of ideas. What's good about this setup is that all your save content from the computer version of Safari is now available straight on your phone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In much the same way, iCloud syncs your opened tabs, along with offline reading. Safari also allows you access to your multimedia content without exiting the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like before, if a page is compatible with the integrated Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get a Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. The Reader strips the webpage of ads and makes the layout and font size more suited to a smaller phone screen. And best of all, if you are reading a multi-page article (such as our reviews) getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you scroll to the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the font size via two controls at the top, and also there's a built-in dictionary to look up unknown words.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With every newly activated iPhone 5c you also get the complete iWorks suite including Pages, Numbers, and Keynote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages allows you to import, create or edit documents (doc, docx are supported). It isn't as powerful as some of its Android competitors, but it covers all the basics and will do for most of the users. It also needs to be updated with the iOS 7 skin, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers supports Excel files and also covers all major functionalities you'll probably need. You can easily import files via iTunes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Keynote opens and edits (PowerPoint) presentations. It has all the tools you'll need to create a decent presentation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app has been revamped and has a very useful new feature. You can now drag and drop events if you want to move them to different days. Just tap and hold on an event and you can move it to a different day and hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar benefits greatly from the Facebook integration. Birthdays and events from Facebook are immediately synced with your calendar but you still get the option to omit them from the Calendars tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view by list (iOS's agenda variant), day and month. There's also a toggle to get back to today if you've strayed too far back or forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting your device to landscape orientation automatically opens up the weekly view, which lists all of your events in a side-scrollable fashion. Events are color-coded so you can recognize what's what with a quick glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an event is done the same way as before. You can choose which calendar you want the event to be synced with, add a location, additional notes and set up an alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the Calendars tab. You can customize the iCloud personal and job-related event colors to your liking. You can also create additional calendar entries, for example if you have two jobs (or projects), etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders interface has been changed as well. It comes with three default lists - Scheduled, Calendar and Reminders, but you can create your own lists as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a reminder is easy. The available options are time, place, repeat, priority and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator has a stylish flat new look but no new functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the refreshed Note app. You can share, copy and print notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app has got the new skin as well. It has world clock, alarms, stopwatch and timer. You can set any of the songs in your music library as an alarm sound. You can also choose from your custom ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app has had a major update. It now offers live weather animations, a lot more weather information plus the time of sunrise and sunset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom out and get to the cities view, which would show the weather in all the locations you have stored at the same time. Live animations are also available in the city preview. Night-time specific animations are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compass app, besides the new interface, got some new functionality too. If you swipe to left you'll get an inclinometer. Unfortunately, the inclinometer only measure one of the angles of inclination, rather than both, so it's probably too early to retire your dedicated app. The Stocks app has new color scheme and UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Memos are available as well. You can capture practically unlimited voice memos and send them to others via a message or mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks offers various font and color settings, but on a screen this size, it's just not the best e-reading experience. Pages are side-scrollable only and on a mobile phone that doesn't quite make sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks app is also a PDF viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose different fonts, reduce and increase the text size, change the background and play around with brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PassBook is an e-ticket app that handles all kinds of electronic tickets and reservations (including boarding passes), loyalty cards, coupons, etc. It's Apple's answer to apps like Google Wallet but without the additional NFC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location-aware app makes the right coupon available in the right place and at the right time. The PassBook will report the balance on coupons and cards, let you check your ticket seats and can even show you relevant notifications (e.g. gate or terminal change for a flight).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Updated Siri with new voices<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new iOS version just can't afford to pay no attention to Siri. After more than two years in development the assistant has finally graduated from beta.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as the rest of the iOS 7, Siri now looks different. It always launches in full-screen and has a real-time voice graph. Another UI novelty is the option to edit your voice request with the keyboard in case Siri didn't hear you right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri supports English (American, Canadian, Australian, British), French (France, Canada, Switzerland), German (Germany, Switzerland), Japanese, Italian (Italy, Switzerland), Spanish (Mexico, Spain, US), Mandarin (China, Taiwan), Korean, and Cantonese (Hong Kong) languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important Siri upgrades, of course, are under the hood. Siri now has Wikipedia integration and it offers new voices, there is both female and male English US for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can also carry out commands affecting the iOS - it can turn Bluetooth or Wi-Fi on/off, increase brightness, play voicemails, check other people's social network status, play iTunes Radio stations, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri is a really powerful voice assistant capable of POI search. Assistance with restaurant booking is part of Siri's set of skills. It will find you exactly the restaurant you are looking for and filter the results based on user reviews. You can run impressively detailed searches based on food type, location, outdoor, pool, price range, ratings, etc. This feature is not available in every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri also answer slots of questions and isn't limited to game scores. History, stats, player bios, player comparison, teams, records, etc. Siri should be able to return most of the info right onto its own screen, without switching over to the browser. The same applies to movies. You will get all of your movie-related answers right inside the Siri window - anything about actors, directors, awards, movie stats, premieres and tickets, reviews, trailers, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has replaced Google with TomTom as map provider for the iOS native Maps application. It also offers voice-guided navigation courtesy of Siri. The navigation will work even on the lockscreen or in the background. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also crowdsourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road. Sadly, there isn't an option to pre-cache maps for offline use, which can be a problem if you need guidance abroad or when you don't have signal. Still, if you set up a route when you have internet access, Maps will cache the maps needed to guide you along the way so you can finish your trip even without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of iOS 7, the navigation service also includes turn-by-turn walking directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Flyover mode is a great bonus for your viewing pleasure. When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is quite limited, but more and more areas are joining Flyover in time. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Maps launched with iOS 6 it was quite a disappointment because of its poor map data, but Apple managed to deal with most of the problems and lack of data and accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you prefer the good ol' Google Maps, it is available for free in the App Store and is on par with its Android version. You get voice navigation where available, offline map caching, Street View, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An even better AppStore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS App Store offers Featured pages with scrollable rows as well as the usual Charts (Top Paid, Free and Grossing apps), Search and Updates. There is on new tab that replaces Genius - Near Me, which we'll cover below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brings one more feature that users have been asking for - automatic app updates. Once you turn it on in the App Store settings, your apps will update automatically (via Wi-Fi only) and you'll get notifications for the completed updates in the notification center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to use the automatic app updates, the Updates tab in the AppStore will display a list of all recent updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store offers another new feature - Nearby apps. Here you'll find the most popular apps people have downloaded in your current location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store has a new hidden extra that will be appreciated by those using iTunes gift cards. You can now scan the card codes with you camera right in the App Store interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you can view all the apps you've bought on your current iDevice or previous ones through the Purchased menu in the Update tab. iCloud plays a key part here - all of your purchased apps from each device show up and are ready for download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes store is where you get music, videos, TV shows, movies, podcasts and ringtones. It has a similar tabbed interface like the AppStore divided into Music, Movies, Search, Tones and More.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Apple is also offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased at the iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection on the computer and check for matches with songs in the Apple's iTunes Store. If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, Apple will upload this song on their servers and then sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So iTunes scans yours songs and pushes them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your tracks are of lower bitrate than 256Kbps, the iTunes Store will replace them with higher quality (256Kbps). The iTunes Match service costs $25(US) or &#x20ac;25(EU) a year.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Game Center looks better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Honestly, the Game Center has always looked awful, but in iOS 7 Apple finally did something about it. We are rather fond of the new look of the app, which is in line with the rest of the operating system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as functionality is concerned the Game Center has remained pretty much unchanged - it has your games, your friends and your challenges.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5c is a very solid smartphone - we know it well because we've spent a year with its previous alter ego, the iPhone 5. Try as we might though, we didn't find any difference between the iPhone 5c and the iPhone 5 that goes beyond the exterior. Sure the battery has grown by 70 mAh, but that's not the kind of difference you can feel in real-life usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The worst part is that not only are the changes skin-deep, but they're also in the wrong direction. When offered the choice between the iPhone 5c and the iPhone 5, not a single member of our team would pick the new smartphone, which actually feels like a downgrade. Despite the solid build quality, this is the first Apple smartphone since the iPhone 4 not to have that premium in-hand feel that the brand has been highly praised for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, the comparison between the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5c is only relevant if you're switching from one to the other which, as you already know, clearly isn't the idea. So the more pressing question here is whether the Apple iPhone 5c is worth your hard-earned cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the colorful little fella is certainly a capable smartphone that offers a solid iOS experience. The latest version of the Apple platform is a big step forward and, even if it's still some way behind Android in terms of functionality, it still provides more features than the majority of users will ever even know about, let alone use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So had the iPhone 5c become the midrange smartphone that rumors tipped it to be, it would have been a real winner. However, its pricing puts it on par or well above than just about every smartphone on the market - barring its own 5s sibling - so things look a bit different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last years' internals and bezels are way too thick for a premium offering in 2013, along with a camera that hasn't been improved upon in two years. The marvelously slim waistline is gone too and the shiny plastic, while fresh and upbeat, is not an advantage around these parts of the market. Just look at the sort of rivals the iPhone 5c will face, and you'll see our point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today you can have either of the three top Android phones - the HTC One (32GB version), LG's G2 (16GB), or the Samsung Galaxy S4 (16GB and a 64GB microSD card) for about ?100 less than Apple wants for the iPhone 5c. Heck, even the fresh-on-the-shelves Sony Xperia Z1 costs less than the plastic iPhone. Those flagships offer amazing performance, excellent large screens and a choice of plastic and metallic bodies to go with the more functional - albeit not as consistent - Android platform.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In case you aren't into big screens, you can have the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini or the HTC One mini for nearly half the price of an iPhone 5c. Both run on dual-core processors, pack 4.3" displays and offer very solid smartphone experience. They are not quite as impressively fluid or productive as the iPhone 5c, but come close enough and save you a few hundred dollars to spend on apps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>But those outside threats aren't even the biggest problem of the iPhone 5c. Those who are into iOS have a much better option in the iPhone 5s. We really can't stress enough how much better bang for your buck you'll be getting by spending the extra $100 on a proper flagship, flaunting a TouchID button and a new camera to wow you, not to mention the more premium body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 5s</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps, this was Apple's plan all along. A support act that wouldn't eclipse the headliner, but help draw attention towards Apple in the hope that once you are in the Apple Store, you will have no trouble finding the right one for you. It's certain that the iPhone 5s was always meant to be the one in charge, with the iPhone 5c sitting on the sidelines as an alternative for those looking for an extra bit of color. No pressure or anything.</paragraph>
