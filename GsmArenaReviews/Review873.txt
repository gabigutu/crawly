			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Large displays are all the rage these days and a phablet with the right price is strategically set to win big. Nokia certainly sees the Lumia 1320 this way, aware of the need of a capable midranger to stand next to the premium 1520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1520 was the latecomer that went on to steal the show, but not all Nokia had to say in phablets in 2013. The door was left open and the Lumia 1320, which is probably more important to Nokia in the long run, didn't need a second invite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 is toned down version of the Lumia 1520 and is tailored to fit both the needs and budget of its potential customers. We are more than used to seeing Lumia smartphones do well enough on far from stellar hardware, and Nokia's choice of the trusty Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset and a 5MP camera, seems to make sense on a device like the Lumia 1320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the Nokia Lumia 1320 is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 is a Déj? Vu of sorts - both on the inside and out. We've seen this particular hardware configuration in a handful of Lumia family members, and the similarities on the outside are hard not to notice either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if it ain't broke, why fix it, right? The Lumia 1320 is nothing out of the ordinary in terms of build and finish - but one can turn that around and say it's actually quite pleasant and friendly. A bright-colored polycarbonate back cover folds around the inner body, which holds a 6" 720p display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that we're talking a massive phone here, so there's quite a lot of room for a battery and Nokia made good use of it. 3,400mAh is a lot and it's a promise this Lumia will run as a happy puppy for extended periods of time, while the dual-core Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset should ensure smooth sailing for Windows Phone 8 OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the pieces of the puzzle tie nicely together when looking at the Nokia Lumia 1320 from afar, but a closer look may reveal the compromises that had to be made to reach this price point. We're all here for the close-up, aren't we? Let's start our journey with a thorough inspection of the Nokia Lumia 1320's exterior.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package covers the basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 ships in a standard retail box, which holds the usual set of accessories that Nokia phones come with. Inside the large, blue box there's a charger with a detachable microUSB cable, a single piece headset and some printed manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Lumia 625, there's no extra back cover in the box of the Lumia 1320.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1320 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 is, inevitably, a large slab, just like the Lumia 1520. The 6" screen alone isn't going to easily fit in a pocket, if at all. At 164.2x 85.9 x 9.8mm, it's actually reasonably sized for a phablet, but a tad larger and thicker than the premium Lumia 1520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its weight however is something to consider. The Lumia 1320 weighs a good 220g, which is nearly 40g heavier than its main rival, the Galaxy Mega 5.8, which weighs in at just 182 grams (but it has a smaller, 2,600mAh, battery).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You won't mistake the Nokia Lumia 1320 for any other make of phone on the market - the design of the Lumia line-up, which has been pretty much set in stone, is instantly recognizable. In fact, the Lumia 1320 is actually very similar to the Lumia 625. Almost too similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that we're complaining - the Lumia 625 is a good looking phone, albeit a little too simple and understated. Both have replaceable back panels in a variety of bright paint jobs, which don't just cover the back, but wrap around the sides as well. This works as a subtle accent, forming a slim frame around the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the only benefit of a removable back panel is missing - the 3400mAh battery is non-user-replaceable. Still, the matte finish is quite resistant to fingerprints, but still has enough texture so as to provide grip and not feel poorly made. In fact, it feels more premium than a large portion of the other plastic phones we've come across.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Lumia 1320 comes with a white back panel, but Nokia offers black, yellow and red, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond that, the design of the 1320 is largely the same as what you'll find on most other Lumias: rectangular frame with tapered edges, for a subtly curved back. A notable difference lies in the display on the front, which unlike the 625 doesn't sport the gently tapered edges. Other than that, the rectangular look and beveled sides have been an unmistakable trait of the Lumia line since its inception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Lumia 1320 is solidly built and quite pleasant to handle with one annoying exception - although the rear cover seems to fit quite tightly, the inner body would move up and down within the case if you press the screen down and slide. It's just a slight wobble, but one you can really feel it. It could be just our review unit though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three capacitive keys - Back, Home and Search. At the edge where glass meets frame is the microphone pinhole, while above the screen is the VGA front-facing camera, the ambient light and proximity sensors, and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is where all of the hardware buttons are. From top to bottom they include the volume rocker, Power/Lock key, and the two-step camera shutter key. Like we mentioned, all the buttons come as part of the back panel, so they'll keep a uniform color should you choose to replace it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device features no controls and ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key can be used to wake up the screen, but another way to unlock the Nokia Lumia 625 is to long press the shutter key. There's an option to either start the stock WP camera or Nokia's Camera app (which we'll cover later on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the phone hold the 3.5mm audio jack and USB port, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, you'll find the 5MP camera lens alongside an LED flash, and there's a speakerphone grille towards the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've covered the removable back panel in detail, so let's get into what's underneath. The 3400mAh battery is sealed within the inner body and therefore non-user-replaceable, which is a bit of a downer considering the non-unibody design. To the right of the camera lens you'll find the microSIM and microSD card slots stacked on top of each another.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no going away from the fact that the Lumia 1320 is a large device. It'll be near impossible to operate with one hand. The Lumia design may feel a bit played up, but its minimalism works on a phablet quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Realistically, the majority of the potential Lumia 1320 users will be using both of their hands to handle it. The matte plastic provides very good grip, on top of being fingerprint-resistant.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 has a 6" IPS LCD screen of 720p resolution for a pixel density of 245ppi. The LCD incorporates Nokia's ClearBlack tech - a set of polarizing filters, which minimize glare. Plus, there's Gorilla Glass 3 on top - the strange thing is the Lumia 1520 has only the second gen screen protection and not this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive display has the super sensitive touch technology allowing it to detect user input even through gloves. Just make sure you enable it in the settings menu if you need it, as it's disabled by default to conserve battery power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option that the Lumia 1320 has is the Lumia Color Profile. It gives you two sliders to play with in the settings - one for color temperature (which spans the cool, neutral and warm range) and color saturation (natural to vivid).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Glance screen keeps the clock and notification icons visible on the lockscreen. This could be set to only display for a little while after lock, intermittently on and off and always on. There's a separate always on setting for when the device is charging. A Night mode allows you to pick a different color for the Glance screen info - Red, Green or Blue - if the default White setting is too bright for your sleepy eyes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Glance Screen settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One new option in GDR3 is the screen rotation lock. That's an important feature for a phablet, but unfortunately it's only accessible in the Settings menu, which means you have to leave the app you are using to change it, there are no quickly accessible toggles here (this is a common problem for any setting in Windows Phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1320 screen isn't the sharpest we've seen on a phablet. The 720p resolution stretches a bit thin on the 6" diagonal, but it's not too bad really. You can fairly comfortably read books on the Lumia 1320 and view websites. Granted, it's not as crisp to look at as is the Note 3 or the Lumia 1520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great news is that the viewing angles and contrast are good and colors look great. Outdoor visibility is another key area where the 6" IPS LCD excels - you won't be having any problems showing your friends any content even in bright sunlight.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a sufficiently large battery inside, Nokia quotes the Lumia 1320 at a maximum 3G talk time of 21 hours and 9 hours of video payback time. Our own test was concluded with an endurance rating of 75 hours. That's how long the smartphone's battery would last you if you use it for an hour of web browsing, an hour of video playback and an hour of talking each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not bad, but if you want even better battery performance in the Windows Phone segment, the Lumia 1520 is definitely the one to check, as it crossed the 100 hour battery rating barrier late last year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: GDR3 + Lumia Black<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 comes with Windows Phone 8 GDR3 (the Lumia Black edition) out of the box. The Microsoft-issued GDR3 release and the Nokia-made Black enhancements add a handful of new features, which we'll go through now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the user interface still feels very familiar if you are coming from another Windows Phone device. Yes, you can fit more Live Tiles per row on the homescreen (6 of the smallest ones, up from 4), but that turned out to be a function of the screen size rather than a Lumia Black specific feature. There are a couple of other changes, we'll get to those in a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button or a double tap on the screen reveals the lockscreen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device or you can just press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone and jump straight into the camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a reasonable level of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to display notifications and images. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps to show a less detailed quick status. There are already apps in the Store that display the battery percentage on the lockscreen via those kind of notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - you can let the music player replace the lockscreen image with the album art of the currently playing track, or let one of the installed apps choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live Tiles, which can be reordered any way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more. Unfortunately, the app launcher is still just an alphabetical list of all apps, no folders, no icon grid. We don't think it works too well on a 6" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 lets you resize the live tiles. Upon a tap and hold, you'll get an extra resize button, next to the unpin one. You can opt between a quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking, though not with the level of user control that Android allows. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). If an app needs to run in the background (sat-nav clients, messengers, etc.) it can. Microsoft is expected to bring an even better multi-tasking with the Windows Phone 8.1 update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new feature in GDR3 is that you can "close" apps by hitting the X button. It's not as comfortable as swiping apps away, but at least now you have control over the recent apps list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the Settings submenu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes. There's a new Screen rotation lock feature, but it requires you to exit the app, find it in the settings, enable it and then get back to the app. The same goes for all the other settings, it's just too many steps for such a common task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live Tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has confirmed it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android, for example, has a widget that shows you a list of emails complete with the subject and a line of the message body. You can scroll through that list and hit a specific message to read it. There are more examples of how widgets are more interactive than Live Tiles and while the difference is relatively minor on the small 4" screen of the Lumia 520, the setup feels limiting on the large, 720p screen of the Lumia 1320. Let's not even mention the split-screen multitasking and mini apps that are popular on 5+ inch devices and are certainly not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1320 comes with the Data Sense app, which shows you the amount of data you've used. Both cellular and Wi-Fi traffic is accounted for. There are different data limit types: one-time, monthly and unlimited. The first two accept custom bandwidth limit values, while the latter is applicable if you have an unlimited data plan, but would still like to track your usage. With GDR3 there's an option to prevent data usage when roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Data Sense can also restrict the background data usage for all apps, provided you're near a preset data limit. This will prevent some apps from functioning properly, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Driving Mode can be enabled automatically when the phablet connects to a specific Bluetooth device (i.e. your car's stereo). This mode mutes all notifications except calls and texts, but you can mute those too. If you do, you can set an automatic reply text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info relevant to their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a WP8 handset, the Nokia Lumia 1320 also supports voice commands - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Unfortunately, the Windows assistant is still far behind the competition as far as recognition speed and accuracy are concerned. Microsoft is said to be working on a new virtual assistant dubbed Cortana, which should premiere with WP8.1 in US English in early 2014 and before the end of 2014 for the rest of the world (in 44 additional languages).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an Add Contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to build the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" options. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many contacts and too many notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions: "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab has the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc.), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 offered loud and clear in-call sound. Signal reception was problem-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The Phone live tile will show the number of missed calls, as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 1320 scored a Below average mark. Be careful to turn up the volume and vibration when in even mildly noisy environments, as you'll have a hard time hearing it ring if you don't.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very capable messenger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (only the whole message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails as read/unread, flag and unflag, etc. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with busy inboxes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text does take some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up with the available actions and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos with SkyDrive integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include Bluetooth file transfer, messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music, Videos, FM radio share one app, Noka Music still on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of Albums, Songs, Playlists, Genres and Artists. Videos feature All, Television, Music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with your PC. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like. Sadly, there's no equalizer to be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since the GDR2 update. Now it supports XviD, DivX, MOV and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on board the Lumia 1320, thanks to the Lumia Amber firmware. You can use the loudspeaker for the FM radio, though you still need the headset connected as it doubles as an antenna. To enable the loudspeaker playback, just tap and hold on the station and select the appropriate option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 makes for an adequate portable music player, offering decently clean audio output. Its volume levels could do with a little boost, but that's only going to be an issue for a small portion of the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mid-range Nokia phablet did very well in the first part of our test, posting excellent scores for everything but intermodulation distortion. And that distortion level is hardly detectable outside of our lab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's next to no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. Outside of the usual stereo crosstalk increase (which isn't as bad as with some other phones), the readings are barely affected. The volume levels are somewhat uninspiring in both testing scenarios though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera is alright<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 boasts a 5 MP camera, which is capable of taking pictures of up to 2592x1936 pixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and a couple of controls on the right. Those are the still/video camera toggle and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera UI</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding the shutter key will wake the phone up with and launch the camera app. The Lumia 1320 is not the fastest shooter around and it takes it a couple of seconds before a photo is taken. This is a longer delay than what we're used to from current smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses are an interesting take at feature add-ons, enhancing the camera functionality without making a mess of third party apps each with its own UI. Lenses are accessible directly from the native camera app (they show up in the list of installed apps too if you want to pin a Lens to the start screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenses</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Glam Me lens used for beautifying shots, plus the Panorama and Cinemagraph lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph creates photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given its modest specs, the Nokia Lumia 1320 fares as well as you could expect in terms of image quality. The level of detail is among the best for the 5 MP league and even if that's not the most prestigious league to be competing in, the Lumia 1320 will do for more casual shots. Contrast is good too, although white balance is a hit and miss affair with colors getting a somewhat unpleasant bluish tint on many occasions. Noise is kept well under control.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder captures 1080p@30fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance and turn the continuous auto-focus on or off. You can use the LED flash as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camcorder interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 captures 1080p videos, which are quite smooth and pack lots of detail. The continuous auto-focus sometimes is too sensitive though, but it's nice there is an option to turn it off. Unfortunately, there is no touch focus option, you have to rely on the auto-focus for the video, and it sometimes fails when shooting close objects such as our Ferris Wheel for the video comparison tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are accurate and contrast is good too, but the dynamic range isn't as spot on as we'd hoped for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bitrate is reasonable at 20 Mpbs and the framerate is steady at 30 fps. The 1320 captures only mono sound at 96 Kbps bitrate and 44 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p video sample we've uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, quad-band 3G with HSPA and penta-band 4G LTE connectivity (there are three versions of the phone with a different set of 3G and LTE bands).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in range of an LTE network, the 1320 will do up to 150Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If not, HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager (although a third party app is now in its beta testing stages) and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone and your microSD storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast Internet Explorer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on the Lumia 1320 is the classic Windows Phone 8 deal, which has hardly changed with the minor update of the OS. The Lumia 1320 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing although it's not quite as great as the Lumia 1520's 1080p unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer browser on the Nokia Lumia 1320 had the same great SunSpider and BrowserMark performance as its Lumia 1020 predecessor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 1320 brings you to the new Bing search app. At first glance, it's the same app overall - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Local Scout now integrated into the places section of Nokia Maps, there are now two search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is the camera scanner, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone Store reaches 200k apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of available apps has recently passed the 200,000 milestone and while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that 46 out of the top 50 apps on the other platforms are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 don't work on the older versions but all of the older apps are compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop till you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have an Xbox Music pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected, limited 10 downloads per month). The service costs $10 / ?8.99 a month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, or the windowsphone.com website, from where you can push apps to your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Games tile, previously known as Xbox Live, is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HERE Maps and Drive get a makeover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a high-end Lumia smartphone, the 1320 gets the Drive navigation suite for free out of the box. Unlike Drive+ available on higher-end Lumias, Drive has only local coverage, meaning it can only be used in one country. Since its map data is available offline, you don't have to worry about roaming data charges, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Drive offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for your country, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Drive does voice-guided navigation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers and even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most recent update to the HERE suite adds an overview of traffic conditions in your area, including your drive to and from work with the My Commute app. My Commute shows you an at-a-glance look at your specified commute with a special Live Tile on your homescreen. You can setup up multiple commutes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Maps has a ton of info</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Maps can be used for basic navigation too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest release, the former Local Scout and City Lens features have been integrated into the Places section of HERE Maps, and gives you a quick view of restaurants, shops, galleries and other POIs around you, including an augmented reality view via the camera called LiveSight. Tapping the virtual signs in the camera interface pops up more info about the place, as well as directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The places interface lets you view POIs on the map as well as through the camera </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent Office skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view like basically any other calculator on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lumia exclusive apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's Zinio, which isn't made by Nokia but is exclusive to Lumia devices on Windows Phone. Zinio creates a reading list based on your interests and you can set it to download them for offline reading (only over Wi-Fi). Zinio is also a shop for digital magazines - you can buy single issues or subscribe for 12 issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Zinio reader</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has pre-installed its cool Creative Studio that is really powerful and offers some awesome features. After you choose a photo you must select an effect you want to apply (it's optional, of course). Then you can use focus+blur mode to focus on an object and blur the rest of the picture. You can also select a color to keep and make the rest of the image black and white. Collage maker is also included. Naturally, various image editing options such as color balance, brightness, crop, rotation, auto fix, radial+tilt shift, etc. are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is this new app called Nokia Storyteller. It's quite similar to Samsung's Story Album. After a shooting session you are able to group all the new photos into an album. Albums can be created based on location, the people in the photo and when the shot was taken. Storyteller is much better looking than Samsung's Story Album, more intuitive and easy to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is obviously hoping the Lumia 1320 will hit the ground running and that hope isn't unfounded, considering the loud bang the 1520 produced and the solid record of the Lumia 520 and Lumia 620. Providing all the necessities at a reasonable price is a Nokia staple in the Windows Phone midrange. It's been a winning formula for the Finns in smartphones, so no obvious reason why it won't work in phablets as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, maybe there're some after all? The 1320 is very late to the phablet scene to begin with, which means Androids have had plenty of time to feel right at home. The devices in question aren't just powerful in hardware, but some have hot glass bodies and even tricks such as a swiveling camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 is proven to behave on less than premium hardware, but it's not the platform of choice for most game makers out there. As a result, the Lumia 1320 squanders some of the potential of that large screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If not for gaming though, the Lumia 1320 has a knack for some serious work. With Windows Phone 8 you get probably the best document editing software on a phone and it will play nicely on the 6" screen. Then, there's the excellent SkyDrive integration to keep the files in sync and safe from harm's way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not least, the free offline voice-guided navigation is certainly a nice perk too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Lumia 1320 will need every bit of those against rivals that match it on price and outbid its specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 is arguably the most dangerous rival for the Lumia 1320, matching its chipset and screen resolution. The Mega has a larger, 6.3" display, but isn't much bigger than the 1320 and is far lighter despite having the same 3,200 mAh battery. The strongest weapon of the Smasung is its Android 4.2.2 platform, but it also has the Lumia beat in the camera department with its better 8MP snapper. Its price is on par with that of the 1320, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 I9200 ? Huawei Ascend Mate</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate is next. Its 6.1" display packs 720p resolution, with a quad-core chipset ticking inside along 2GB of RAM. It's also lighter than the 1320 and packs a significantly larger 4,050mAh battery. Not to mention, it's cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM functionality would've probably fitted the 1320 better, but the Lumia line-up doesn't go there. If a dual-SIM phablet is something you want, then the Acer Liquid S1 is a viable option. It too has a quad-core chip, runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and packs a 720p screen. It's also cheaper than the 1320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Acer Liquid S1 ? Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nothing wrong with the good-ol' Samsung Galaxy Note II either. Sure, it's not the latest and greatest Android phablets can offer, but it too is less expensive than the 1320. Not to mention you get the pretty cool S Pen functionality that's good for both fun and work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ASUS FonePad Note 6 looks tempting too with a 6" 1080p display. It's rocking a dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Atom CPU, 1GB of RAM and an 8MP camera. It's not only slightly cheaper than the Lumia 1320, but also weighs less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Asus Fonepad Note FHD6 ? Oppo N1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fairly recent Oppo N1 is a clearly more expensive option but not by much, considering we're talking a serious cameraphone with a 5.9" 1080p display, Snapdragon 600 and a few unique features: a swivel 13MP camera, rear touchpad the O-Click remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 will certainly find its place under the phablet sun but it seems at this point a number of droids can offer more for less. What we shouldn't underestimate is the outstanding Lumia 1520, which may as well be able to pull its sibling along. Plus, the success of the Lumia 520 probably means there's a core of happy Windows Phone users who may be ready for something bigger, but not too pricy.</paragraph>
