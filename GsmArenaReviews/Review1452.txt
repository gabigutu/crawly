			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This week we step away from our usual line of work to do some time travel. We?re looking back at the ten years that we?ve been following the mobile phone industry. It doesn?t start nor end with us, but we just couldn?t resist the temptation to pause and slowly rewind the evolution of mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a live show and tomorrow we?ll all be back to covering the whole thing as it unfolds. But today it?s the flashback episode, where we find out how it went from Motorola StarTac through Moto RAZR to the iPhone and a bunch of phones with the HD moniker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People tend to romanticize the past but mobile phones seem to have no respect for their ancestors. Technology has advanced at breakneck speed and our humble database is nothing short of a time machine. Hop on for a journey in the history of mobile phones. And by the way, it?s history you ? our readers ? wrote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We dug deep inside our server logs ten years back. We traced certain trends to present day and we have some interesting charts to show you. It?s all there: how form factor preferences have mutated through the years and how touchscreen has changed the game today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will also learn how slimness, weight and screen size went up and down over the years. As you see, we?ve got a long story to tell. But first, let?s explain how we sourced the raw data for this unusual research.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stats are based on all the GSM phone models we have been adding and updating since 2000. We?ve put billions of page hits in the equation to make sure it?s accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems nobody has done similar research so far so we didn?t have a way to cross-check our findings, but everything seems to tie in nicely with our personal observations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two limitations we need to point out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, back in the old days we used to put down only the phones? announcement date in the database and not the actual launch date. So you may notice a certain time shift in the charts. For instance, a large number of 2003 models were popular in 2004, because it was when they were actually available. That shouldn?t be a problem though, the info is still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Secondly, we?ve broken down the raw data into two types of averages. With the absolute averages every model has the same statistical importance (same weight). The second type, the weighted average, accounts for the fact that models have different importance (varied weight) depending on their popularity (measured by user hits).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put it simply ? touchscreen phones have a simple average of 20% of all phones in 2008, but a weighted average of 35%. The absolute average tells us that of all phones one in five was a touch phone, which is a generally unimpressive share. But this same year touch phones generated one third of all the hits on our phone database. They were the most popular (and potentially most high-end) models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind though, that the weighted average is a wee bit skewed towards the more expensive phones, since those generate a disproportionately higher amount of traffic. You know people are not fascinated by run-of-the-mill handsets. They don?t look them up online, they don?t research them ? they simply use them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Clamshells<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Clamshells used to be a huge hit ? they look all but a dying breed today. The form factor specifics make them unfit for the current market and we can hardly see this trend reversing anytime soon. Screen size is limited to a maximum of half the phone?s height and they are just too thick. And as we?ll see in a while, big screens and slim profiles are what modern phones are all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all that in mind, we cannot help but feel that clamshells will have the same fate as flip down phones and will eventually become extinct.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip down phones have been around since the dawn of mobile phone days and for quite a few years even hanged near the top of the food chain. From Ericsson T10s in 1999 to the dual-keyboard-and-touchscreen Sony Ericsson P990 (it?s no coincidence that the manufacturer is the same ? the Swedes were certainly good at those) flip-down phones were ruling the lands, before a rather sharp and unfortunate turn of events saw them rapidly disappear during an Ice Age. Their own creator was giving them the cold shoulder ? and a rather chilly shoulder at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Ericsson T10s ? Sony Ericsson P990</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First it was the T-series candy bars, the T-rexes of the flock. Then Sony Ericsson went with the bar form-factor for the P1 and that was the last nail in their coffin. The flip-down had a brief cameo appearance later on with the Sony Ericsson W350 but that didn?t exactly set the world alight, and ended with a puff rather than a bang.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson P1 ? Sony Ericsson W350</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the regular clamshells, there was a time, when they accounted for almost half of all phones (and even more than half in 2004). However, once the Motorola StarTAC days were over they were never able to regain their high-end status as the graph clearly shows. Weighted averages are always less than absolute averages, which indicates that there were always more relatively unpopular clamshells (entry-level, mid-range) than there were popular ones (high-end).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the revolutionary Motorola RAZR V3 and the host of sequels released helped the clamshells claim back quite a lot of ground. With some help from other legendary devices like the Panasonic VS3 and VS6, the Moto RAZR did make 2005 the year of the fold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola RAZR V3 ? Panasonic VS3 ? Panasonic VS6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunate for clamshell fans and twice as unfortunate for Motorola - who at one point thought they can live forever by just releasing the next RAZR update every few months ? it was all downhill from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G400 Soul was the last memorable addition to the clamshell ranks. But even its premium finish and great features could not change the fact that clamshells had forever turned into mid-range phones (usually with distinctly female appeal).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> SamsungG400 Soul</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sliders<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sliders at one point seemed the answer to the problems that clamshells tried to deal with. Big screen and keypad can fit in a body of a relative small surface, plus you get the keys protected against accidental presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But unfortunately, just like clamshells, sliders add a few millimeters around the waistline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliders were off to a very slow start, the form factor only gaining some popularity around 2004. However they took the world by storm after that and some of the most interesting devices ever released on the market fall in the slider category. That?s easily confirmed by a quick glance at the graph ? the weighted average has an advantage over the absolute average in all years prior to 2010.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a matter of fact, 4 of the 6 most popular handsets of all time in our database are sliders. The legendary N95 got near-iconic status for being the first true all-in-one smartphone. The others are the N96, Nokia?s first touch-driven flagship N97 and the XPERIA X1 ? Sony Ericsson?s first PocketPC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N95 ? Nokia N96 ? Nokia N97 ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing with both clamshell and sliders is that once the thickness fell to an all-time low at under 10 mm, they started to put back weight thus losing their edge against competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike clamshells though, sliders are here to stay, or at least they have the potential to last quite a while longer. The reason for this is their evolution to side-sliding QWERTY messengers. Those too had a hard time taking off (the dark times of HTC TyTNs), but are now among the most compelling models in our database ? especially with the all-you-can-eat messaging plans, always online social networking and push email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC TyTN ? HTC TyTN II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all users need a hardware QWERTY keyboard, so while this twist of events kept the sliders in the game, they were confined to a niche of their own. Their relative popularity might remain high, but in terms of sheer numbers they have no chance of reaching the 20+ market share they had in 2007-2008.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the chart, some of you might think that 2010 has also dealt a major blow on their popularity as their weighted average stands at the modest 13.4 percent. However we are only at the midway point of a year that hasn?t seen many major slider announcements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rumored arrival of devices such as Nokia N9 and E7, and the QWERTY-enabled Samsung Galaxy S may as well fix things up for the sliders and solidify them as the third largest (in terms of number of the devices released) and second most-popular form factor. . Not to mention we?re expecting Windows Phone 7 smartphones later this year and as things look, they might use a QWERTY sibling on their side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a lot to be said about QWERTY equipped handset as a whole, so we?ve prepared a dedicated chart for them too. We?ll present it further down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Candy bars<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bar-shaped phones are the oldest and most popular species in our database, accounting for almost half of the total. More than half of all announcements in the 2000-2003 period were candy bar phones. They were briefly outpaced by the clamshells in their golden time and then returned on top in 2006 for three consecutive years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular candy bar handsets were basking in popularity in that period, their weighted averages exceeding the absolute averages in every year save for 2005.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately for the classic and retro fans, the bar-shaped phones, much like the clamshells and sliders, were swept away by the touchscreen revolution and they lost much of their influence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen is all the rage now and it seems nothing can stop them take over the market eventually. Even the almighty Nokia Eseries are about to go touch so there is little hope really for non-touch candy bars staying anywhere near the high end. If that?s the way things are going we are not going to complain ? technology is evolving and that?s the beauty of our job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia E61 ? Nokia E50 ? Nokia E71</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to mention here that despite the falling interest indicated on our chart, the number of non-touch bar phones sold worldwide is still huge and it will remain so until touchscreen devices get cheap enough for even developing markets to accommodate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until then, we?ll continue to enjoy the sight of phones like the Nokia 6500 classic and 6700 classic. There are still quite a lot of those near the top of our site?s all time popularity ladder: Nokia N73, E71, N70 and 6300 all sit comfortably in the top ten. But things are changing and a look at the current popularity standings is telling: the best placed non-touch bar is the Nokia E72 (10th all-around). The days of this form factor?s reign are numbered and they?ll be soon pushed down by something with less buttons and more screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 6300 ? Nokia 6500 classic ? Nokia 6700 classic ? Nokia N73</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Touchscreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A picture is worth a thousand words and this particular graph really tells the whole story here. Touchscreen devices have been around for ages but only managed to gain some significant market share after 2007 (perhaps even 2008).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Their first claim to fame in 2004 was largely unsuccessful ? the world and the industry were not ready to take the jump. That period still gave us some decent devices like the Sony Ericsson P-series and Motorola A1000, but those power gadgets were exceptions rather than the standard deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson P800 ? Sony Ericsson P900 ? Motorola A1000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that the touchscreen phone was invented in 2004. The first touch input devices saw daylight more than ten years ago, the first touch-driven addition to our database being the Alcatel OT COM. However it wasn?t before the Sony Ericsson P800 was announced that their presence was really felt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alcatel OT COM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second go though was a huge success. Touchscreen phones currently account for more than half of all announcements with their popularity (among GSMArena readers) reaching the amazing 80 percent. Never before has a class of devices held such a firm grip on the market and we are only going to be seeing more of the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two important factors contributed to the boom of touchscreen. The first was the massive improvement of hardware that allowed better, more-sensitive screens capable of higher resolution to take care of the increasing display size. The processing power also got a major boost and touch input is processed quickly and accurately for a fluid UI and great touch experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other major landmark on the mobile market as we know it today, is a certain mobile phone by Apple, which set the standards of touchscreen usability back in 2007. Favoring looks and ease of use over functionality, it made a revolution ? a splash that still produces ripples even today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course credit should be given to all competitors. And if revolution sounds like an overstatement ? just go ahead and ask Motorola. It?s amazing what touchscreen (and Android) have done for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola DEXT MB220 ? Motorola MILESTONE ? Motorola BACKFLIP</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia on the other hand, have found it hard to adapt to the new world order. Undoubtedly still the market leader, the Finns are struggling to catch up with the touchscreen standard-setters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the touchscreen development, touch phones are beginning to take on the low-to-midrange market segments as well. Cookies and Corbys are all set to cater for most users? needs. Unfortunately, most of them miss on the high-level of UI usability and performance that has made Touch UI so popular in the first place. But we do expect improvement with each next generation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Swivel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are many other small-time form factors that didn?t make it but brought novelty back in their day. Judging by their small numbers, they?ve always remained marginal but some of them were quite sensible and practical. For instance, take Nokia N93 style of shooting the camcorder way or Nokia E70 inconspicuous folding QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first things first. Swivels were probably the most popular among the marginal form factors ? Nokia and Sony Ericsson were bold enough to take the form factor to the high-end segment. However the low reliability and high manufacturing costs eventually took their toll and sent these devices into oblivion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still there was a time when cameraphone lovers would kill for a Sony Ericsson S700. The S600 and its W600 music-centered brother attracted quite a lot of attention too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson S700 ? Sony Ericsson S600 ? Sony Ericsson W600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia decided that fashion-savvy would best appreciate the form factor and so the 7370 and 7373 were born.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola too had several goes at fashionable swivel devices ? the V70 is where it all started, while the ultra-expensive Aura is certainly among the last representatives of a dying breed. The American company recently showed that it hasn?t forgotten about this unusual class of devices by announcing the FlipOut Android smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is the last company earning a mention here with the four swivel handsets that they manufactured. The South Koreans obviously thought the form factor was not good enough for high-end handsets so the trio F200, F210 and X830 was all they did with it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top swivels made for a nice alternative<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other Korean electronics giant, LG, had another interesting take at swiveling mobile phones. The rotating screens of the U960, KU950 and V9000 made it easy to toggle between portrait and landscape modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG U960 ? KU950 ? LG V9000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A little while later though, accelerometer sensors kicked in and made the whole display rotation thingy a whole lot easier and more natural and in turn made these top-swivels obsolete.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pivoting clamshells<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The pivoting clamshells were where clamshells and swivels met. Attractive as that combination might have seemed when Nokia introduced N90 and later N93 and N93i, it actually takes more from the disadvantages of the two form factors than from their respective advantages so understandably it didn?t last very long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>the Nokia 6260 was marketed as a fashionable device back in its day and had quite some fans , but those three Nseries smartphones were too bulky for everyday use. The form factor felt quite natural for photo/video purposes though and is still used on popular camcorders such as the Sanyo Xacti line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 6260 ? Nokia N90 ? Nokia N93 ? Nokia N93i</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG, and later Samsung, also put some effort into the pivoting clamshell with the G7100, G7120, G7200 and P900, before giving up on it eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG G7100 ? LG G7120 ? LG G7200 ? Samsung P900</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bottom pivots<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another alternative to the first swivels was introduced by Nokia with its musically-gifted couple 5700 and 3250. The bottom parts of those first members of the XpressMusic family pivoted around their center axis. Thus their bottom halves accommodated a two-face design that gave user access to both a traditional multi-tap keypad and a pad with dedicated music keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 3250 ? Nokia 5700</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-display, dual keypad communicators<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huge phone on the outside and tiny laptops on the inside, the communicators have always been a Nokia-only territory. Their high prices and huge bodies meant that their user base will always remain limited, but they sure as hell were pretty great devices. Amazingly functional for their time, the communicators were unable to adapt to the mobile's world new way of thinking (slimmer is better) and that's what eventually killed them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E90 ? Nokia 9210i Communicator ? Nokia 9110i Communicator ? Nokia 9000 Communicator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also had a brief spell as a communicator manufacturer. The KT610 wasn't too bad of a device but the company wasn't too keen to promote it and for such an eccentric device no advertisement spells certain death.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KT610</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY folder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back in 2003, Nokia came up with an intriguing design, allowing a full QWERTY and a regular multi-tap keyboard to co-exist on a device with relatively compact dimensions. Starting with the 6800, the folding QWERTY keyboard was reserved for high-end smartphones too. Finns later went on to introduce a bunch of follow-up models (6810, 6820 and 6822).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 6810 ? Nokia 6820 ? Nokia 6822 ? Nokia E70</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The swan song of this form-factor was the E70 smartphone, after which the inherently larger size of this form factor brought its doom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dead-end experiments<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>They wanted to make a difference - they were famous for being famous. Today they are relegated to the less than glorious category of dead-ends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every once in a while, designers were let off the leash to give us gadgets out of this world. The honorable mention goes to all those rebels without a cause that - from the distance of time - look more like rebels without a clue. Almost every company has a few of those and none of them managed to sustain any kind of long-term success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With little popularity and near non-existent fan base to provide cushion against temporary crisis, those extravagant solutions were immediately forgotten as soon as less inventive and more practical models appeared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens probably deserve credit for contributing to the ranks of one-hit-wonders with their Xelibri line. Still in or near their prime, the company wanted to make a difference and obviously didn't mind taking the risk of bringing something new and very different to the market. It all backfired spectacularly and probably contributed to the Siemens downfall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Siemens Xelibri 1 ? Siemens Xelibri 4 ? Siemens Xelibri 5 ? Siemens Xelibri 6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another couple of popular weird form-factor devices are the Samsung's Serene and Serenata. The Serenata even had the Bang &amp; Olufsen seal of approval but that came with a price tag that doomed the concept from the very start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Serene ? Samsung Serenata (Bang&amp;Olufsen)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a company that cemented their market leading spot with neat candy bars, Nokia are known for sudden - sometimes dramatic - creative outbursts. We wonder if anyone remembers their first N-gage devices. Or the pen-shaped 7280 and 7380? How about the square-ish 7600? OK, they were too much we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N-gage ? Nokia 7600 ? Nokia 7280 ? Nokia 7380</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today Motorola seem to have a thing for extravagant designs. The BACKFLIP and the FlipOut are perhaps the modern equivalents of the Aura or the RIZR Z8. Oh, and beware - the Motocubo and the Charm (they didn't have to state the obvious) seduce without warning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola BACKFLIP ? Motorola FLIPOUT</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end though, people like simple and functional designs and makers know that. Experiments are more of a publicity stunt, than actual attempts at earning millions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unusual devices will probably always appear a few times a year and fuel hot debates before quietly fading into oblivion, when users realize a simple bar does the job just as well, if not better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wristwatch phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All those spy movies have certainly placed the wristwatch phones at a pedestal in the geek's heart. Doing the James Bond thing, talking to your wrist has been a dream to many generations, so understandably when such a device is announced it's greeted with quite a lot of excitement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when there's a large company involved there's always great hope that it will be done right and won't just be all about compromises. Alas, even the ridiculously-priced LG GD910 and the temptingly slim Samsung S9110 weren't good enough to replace a watch (or a phone) properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung WatchPhone ? Samsung S9110 ? LG GD910</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual face bar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There were those two Samsung handsets that were trying to do the two-in-one-slim-body thing. You get the regular keypad with a tiny display on one side and a larger screen with a bunch of music controls on the other. Surely the convenience of a few millimeters shoved off each side didn't fully compensate the fact that you couldn't use the normal keypad and the large screen at the same time so they understandably failed to make an impact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung F300 ? Samsung F500</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Others<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This one, we really don't know what to say about. The Toshiba G450 was such an extravagant device that we cannot even figure out what it was trying to do. Was it trying to prove a concept or was it going for the big sales, hoping to get some extra publicity with its peculiar design? Either way, there wasn't a second device like it so we will consider the experiment unsuccessful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Toshiba G450</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well that's about all the noteworthy form factors that we could think of. We are now about to check out some of the other aspects of the phone evolution where we noticed some interesting trends shaping up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Did you know how much the average phone in 2000 weighed? Or how thick it was? When were matchbox-sized handsets most popular? Well if you don't but want to learn all the nitty-gritty details, stay with us after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Weight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here is a pretty consistent graph for a change. The average weight of the mobile phones has hardly budged an inch over the past decade but if you think that there is no story to be told here you are mistaken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today's mobile market is all about squeezing the best performance out of components that are ever decreasing in size. A phone with the same feature set as high-end models from 5 years ago could easily be twice as compact and just as light nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not what the general public really wants. Except for a brief spell in the first half of the decade when a few super minis were all the rage, the best phones have always been the ones with the most features. Siemens did pretty good with their SL55 tiny slider, Ericsson made a serious impact with their T66, but it was Panasonic who took the idea furthest by releasing a bunch of phones not much bigger than a matchbox. GD55, G50 and G51 are the first names that spring to mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Siemens SL55 ? Ericsson T66 ? Panasonic GD55 ? Panasonic G50</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, people used to be fascinated with all-in-one handsets - today they simply need them. Using the available space to incorporate more radios, more powerful hardware and larger screens is what people want and the manufacturers would be foolish not to listen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The finish matters too and the use of exclusive materials on the phones takes its toll. Metal weighs more than plastic and everyone loves a bit of steel or tempered glass on their high-end smartphone, don't they?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So why not just put all available features together in a giant phone, some might ask. Well that's not working all that well either. The Nokia Communicators have always enjoyed a certain degree of success but it's only when the mid-sized E71 stepped in that they were able to truly sell millions of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia E71</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if there is one area where you shouldn't expect major changes in the future it would be the weight. At a bit over 110 grams, devices have found the golden mean between solid feel, pocket-friendliness and functionality and all future performance boosts will perhaps be driven by the further miniaturization of the components. MicroSIM anyone?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slim is always sexy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The thickness chart is completely different from the weight - it shows a clear trend. The original Motorola RAZR was the first model to put the emphasis on slimness. In the years to follow, we observe a steady decrease in handsets' thickness. The similar average and weighted average values show that this trend matters regardless of class and price. It holds in both popular and not so popular phones, both high-end and low-end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola RAZR V3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are also noticing an ever-expanding gap between high-end devices and the average phones. You might be thinking that this is just wrong, considering what we said in the previous chapter but there is actually more to this story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is high-end phones are the ones with larger displays (more on that in a second) and in turn larger surface. So there seems to be enough room to place all those chips without making the device inch thick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However we suspect that the tendency to make phones slimmer by the day will end soon. The average values will probably drop by another millimeter or two but we just can't see them going further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A phone thin enough to fit a credit card slot in your wallet just cannot be durable enough. Surely those RAZRs and the Samsung Ultra lineup were impressive, but only because they were so much slimmer than their chubby contemporaries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today, the omnipresent iPhone 4 is less than 10mm thick and so is the Samsung Galaxy S. Nine users out of ten will tell you that they don't really need any slimmer. So perhaps high-end smartphone thickness will find its golden mean just like weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Apple iPhone 4 ? Samsung Galaxy S</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display size<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bigger is always better when it gets to touchscreen and high-end models. Let's be honest here - did you really expect anything different? We certainly didn't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was a point in the development of mobile phones when the low screen resolution made size increase pointless. That was soon overcome and now we are enjoying 4-inch units with enough pixel density to make them look as sharp as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Steve Jobs will tell you that the iPhone 4 retina display is a whole lot better with its highest-ever pixel count squeezed on a 3.5" unit and, for a change, he will be right. But the difference is not visible in most regular use scenarios, so the iPhone 4's display would've been just as impressive (perhaps even better) was it a bit bigger. But that would've raised other ergonomic issues so there is no telling whether it would have benefited the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone screens keep growing and with touchscreen still having some unconquered corners of the mobile world it would continue to do so for a while longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not sure however if there is a point in going any further than the current level. The HTC HD2 is already stretching it and even though 5" tablet-phone crossovers are already available we wouldn't be as bold as to predict that this will become the norm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dell Streak 5-inch tablet/phone</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY keyboards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Full QWERTY keyboards have also been around for a while now but only recently the share of devices sporting them rose to a significant level. As the smartphones become better and better at many activities, which require loads of text input (email, social-networking, web browsing), faster and more capable typing devices will be needed.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Of course it's not like everyone does so much typing on their mobile phone so their popularity will hardly grow much more. With the improvement of virtual keyboards' layout and the touchscreens' sensitivity (not to mention the ever expanding display sizes) many people are doing just fine without any hard buttons whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But for the ones, who are always on the go and always writing mails and stuff from their mobiles nothing can replace good old tactile feedback keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Introduced back in 2000, the Motorola V.box was probably the first GSM handset to pack a full QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>This article was only meant to explore forms and sizes, not individual features. But just out of curiosity, we decided we'd take a look at the way cameras on mobile phones have developed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever since the Nokia 7650 was introduced in 2002 and proved that mobile phones can also take photos, the camera is one of the first thing the geeks check when looking at a handset's specs sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 7650</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One year later cameraphones already accounted for more than half the hits in our database, while on the third year of their existence they completely dominated the market. With a weighted average of over 80 percent, one can easily see that even 6 years ago everyone wanted a snapper of some kind on the back of their phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choice wasn't too great back then. 1.3 megapixel sensors were considered the pinnacle of evolution and handsets such as the Nokia 6630 sporting it were all the rage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6630</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hardly a surprise then that the camera has been one of the elements that have improved the most over the past years. Resolution has gone up, noise levels have fallen, image-processing has matured greatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dedicated camera keys have taken cameraphones another step closer to dedicated digicams, while lens-protective covers have been invented to guard the precious optics of your handsets. Flashes have stepped in, allowing low-light photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wide-angle lenses seem like the next big thing with some of the camera flagships already coming with those. The Nokia N86 8MP and the upcoming Nokia N8 have a viewing angle of 28mm, while the Samsung camera monster, Pixon12 lenses cover 30mm in 35mm equivalent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N86 8MP ? Nokia N8 ? Samsung Pixon12</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much to the regret of people working in areas where cameras and cameraphones are forbidden the percentage of phones sporting a camera has surpassed 87 percent over the past two years. And the weighted percentage is over 98 so the ones who don't have a camera are merely ultra low-end handsets, which generate little to no interest.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Instead of conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So a full-touch device with a XL screen and just under 10mm thick might as well be the mobile phone of the future - a good chunk of the near future at least. Oh, but we already have quite a few of those. So will it mostly be about improving software, adding applications and upping the processing power or will there be another unexpected twist?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the way the industry has gone in the last decade - we'd rather expect the unexpected. At the time when we were starting off back in the day, mobile phones were just shedding off their external antennae. This may look small today, but back then it was no less a revolution than color screens and polyphonic ringtones. Boy, it's bigger than video-calling will ever be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>10 years is not a long time. So you probably remember monochrome screens were measured by the number of lines of text they fit. And some of you may as well be reading this on a high-res touchscreen. So, what are we to expect in another ten years? We have no idea. And that's the best part of it. So stay around. We sure will.</paragraph>
