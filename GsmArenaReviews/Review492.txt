			<paragraph>Siemens C65 is a middle class mobile phone with an integrated CIF camera. It offers triband functionality, 65K color display, MMS and infrared port at a competitive price. Some of its functions really surprised me. To know more, read the following article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Siemens C65 mobile phone was excelled on the CeBit exhibition earlier this year near S65 and M65 - two of the higher class models. Both business phones attracted the attention of the clients and the small cheap phone remained relatively unnoticed in the show window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Click on the thumbnails for full resolution pictures.  The phone has exchangeable cover shells, therefore the blue color is not the only one available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the model was not a mistake. Siemens C65 will be one of the most important products from the company's summer collection. It is cheap enough to sell well, has an integrated camera, which nowadays is a term, and most of all - it is one of the phones with the biggest variety of functions and protections in this class. This is the perfect mobile phone for the consumers, who are not willing to make great investments in mobile communications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Compare the size of the phone with a credit card ? The back side of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens C65 is a very carefully finished phone. Having some experience with the older Siemens C series phones, I can tell that C65 looks definitely better.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What kind of a phone is this?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I expected Siemens C65 to be just the next member of the C series, something like a slightly improved version of the Siemens C60. I thought that functions would be the same and design - a bit smartened, but I was wrong. Siemens C65 is a mobile phone from the class of CX65 and M65. Well, almost. Siemens C65 is a small and light phone with attractive dimensions and exchangeable shells. There are some differences, which classify it like a phone from a new class.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keyboard and Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The buttons of the keyboard are nicely and conveniently placed. The only inconvenience is that the soft keys and the "red" and "green" call control buttons are too close and too small - you have to be careful to press the right button. The 5-way joystick is used for navigation and for confirmation when pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The keyboard is very convenient for writing and the joystick is passable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When I was at the CeBit fair, I could not get any idea, what the exact function of the button under the joystick is. Undoubtedly mobile operators would describe it as an option for a faster WAP access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The joystick</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is CSTN with 65K colors and 130x130 pixels resolution; it is relatively small, but for me it's one of the best in the class. The back part of the display is reflective, so you could see everything without any problems, even when the display is exposed to direct sun light. The display is bright and clear and there are no visible black lines between the pixels. Certainly, you can put attractive wallpaper on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no hand painted icons in the main menu, which would not provoke positive reactions in people using high-class phones. While I can find the different icons very easy, when using other models, here they are situated in a different way, which makes finding them difficult. The menu navigation is quite fast, but don't expect speed records.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated camera is a necessary feature for the current mobile phones. Siemens C65 takes pictures in 352x288 pixel resolution only. The camera has digital zoom, brightness and white balance controls and a self timer. The images look good on the phone display, but miss some details when viewed on the computer screen. With this MMS capable mobile, you can easily capture your life's most memorable moments thanks to the integrated CIF camera and send them to friends using MMS messaging or the infrared port. There is no way to record video clips with Siemens C65.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There are no functional buttons on the side of the phone. On its left side you can see the infra port and a place for a carrying neck strip. On the backside you will find the lense of the integrated camera and a connector for external antenna.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Most of all I was surprised by the Siemens C65's phonebook. It is capable of saving 1000 entries and has a very well developed memory structure. This makes it similar to phonebooks of higher-class models like CX65 and M65. To each number entry in the phonebook, you can add an address, an e-mail, an ICQ number, date of birth etc. You can arrange the entries in groups and set a different ringtone for each group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  A look under the back cover ? the SIM-card holder ? exchangeable cover shells and button block</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you compare this model with the higher-class phones of Siemens, you will surely notice the lack of capability for reading emails. When you write, you could relay on the T9 predictable text input. The phone features also MMS support. Changing time and date settings is as difficult, as by all other Siemens models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The connection socket ? the loudspeaker</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer and extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Because of the small display dimensions, the calendar has simplified graphics, compared to the higher-class models. It has a monthly, weekly and a daily planning option, as well as variety of alerts reminding you of different happenings on dates. All the saved appointments, meetings and notes can be seen separately - one after the another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens C 65 offers you a unit converter, a stopwatch, a countdown timer and a capability for saving short text notes. There is also a sound recorder available, which is capable of recording for up to 2 hours! The phone has a WAP 2.0 browser as well, but I haven't tried how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Siemens C65</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet I have not written anything about the phone's memory. I think it will be enough just to mention that it is 10.3 MB - a respectable amount, considering the class of the phone. You can save a lot of ringtones, images, Java applications, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pros and cons<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>+ Very good price/performance ratio + Excellent phonebook + 10 MB of memory  - Unattractive menu design - Low resolution camera, no video</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The alternatives<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For about the same price you can also consider these phones.</paragraph>
