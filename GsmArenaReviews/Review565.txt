			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer kicked IFA 2015 off with a wide-reaching press conference. In between the plethora of Chrome OS based products and Windows laptops and PCs, the company also announced a trio of Android smartphones and its first Windows 10 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has a clear vision in its mind that the mid-range is the space it wants to occupy. As such, the Android trifecta consists of lower and upper midrangers, which strive to give best value for money. For those seeking an alternative to Android, the Windows 10 rocking Acer Liquid M330 offers just that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, all four devices sport a familiar design, which Acer debuted at last year?s IFA. There are some very minor changes here and there, but nothing groundbreaking. It certainly looks decent and has allowed Acer to keep price tags as low as it could.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had the opportunity to quickly check out all of the four new phones, so let?s jump right in.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The largest member of the new Liquid Z family is the 630 and its slightly modified brother the 630S. Their only difference lies in the amount of RAM and internal storage, which for the Liquid Z630S is 3GB and 32GB, respectively. The Liquid Z630 makes do with 1GB/2GB (depending on the market) and 16GB of space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wrapping the front of the phone is a 5.5? IPS display of 720p resolution. The screen itself is a bit washed out and lacks in contrast. However, it?s rather bright and sports surprisingly wide viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In spite of the similarities in the design for this year?s crop of Acer midranges, the Z630 stands out from the crowd with a nice combination of a slim waistline and large screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood of the Liquid Z630 hums a 1.3GHz quad-core CPU in the MediaTek 6735 chipset. The 4,000mAh Li-Ion battery is replaceable and promises to run Android 5.1 Lollipop for more than a day. Despite the large battery, the phone weighs just 165 grams, but on the plus side this does make it feel more solid in hand.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Liquid Z530 and Liquid Z530S are slightly smaller with a 5" IPS display of 720p resolution. The more powerful Liquid Z530S sports an octa-core 1.3GHz CPU on the MediaTEk 6753 platform with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage. The regular version is equipped with a quad-core 1.3GHz CPU, 1 or 2GB of RAM (market dependent) and 16GB of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone keeps the slim waistline of just 8.9mm like the biggest Liquid Z630, as well as the dual 8MP camera setup. The battery is down to 2420mAh and so is the weight, which is 145 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Liquid Z530?s design is similar to that of the Z630 and sports a rear-mounted DTS enhanced speaker. We must say it looks better than the one found on the phone?s predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the issues with the screen are similar, too. It?s a bit on the washed out side, but it?s still very bright. From our initial impressions, Android 5.1 Lollipop was quite brisk.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Z330 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last of the Android smartphones is the Liquid M330 and it?s less powerful Liquid Z320 alternative. The latter sports a 1.1GHz quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM on the Qualcomm MSM8209 chipset, while the Liquid Z330 runs on the Qualcom MSM 8909 platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both sport a 4.5? IPS display with a 854 x 480 pixel display and you shouldn?t expect much of it, really. Colors are fairly washed out and the contrast isn?t quite on par with the larger models of the family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Storage is limited, too at 8GB, but we weren?t able to find out if there?s a microSD card slot available. The phone feels very nice in hand and while the plastic isn?t particularly premium, it?s not that bad either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer M330 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Liquid M330 is an exact copy of the Liquid Z330, but runs Windows 10. The unit on display at IFA is kind of a pre-produciton one and as such Windows 10 didn?t run all that well. There were some issues with the screen sensitivity, too. Since the latest iteration of Windows relies heavily on Internet connection, we couldn?t test it all that well either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, here?s a video hands-on of the Liquid M330 in action.</paragraph>
