			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever since Apple's release of the first iPad, Samsung has been churning out tablets to battle them on so many fronts it's starting to look like overkill. With so many larger Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Note varieties out there, it makes sense that Samsung would try to compete against Apple's latest offering too, the iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 caters to a crowd that wants in on the whole tablet game, but wouldn't go all-in with a full-size device. Samsung is able to deliver on this, building on the market experience of its phablets, the S-pen-enabled Galaxy Note and Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the similarities between the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and Note II go even further than the S-pen, as both devices feature the same chipset and processor speed, Android build, and very similar display resolutions. Here's a quick look at what's going on under the hood of the Galaxy Note 8.0:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has done well to offer a device that can compete with the iPad mini across the board. The Note 8.0 gives you a higher resolution WXGA screen, as well as a more robust chipset, and, of course, the S-pen. Samsung even managed to trim down the waistline compared to other Note devices, bringing the 8-inch screen in just 8mm of thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately, can the Note 8.0 be considered a Note II on steroids, or simply a device made to entice users away from the ubiquitous iPad mini? Perhaps even a little of both? Let's take a look at what makes the Note 8.0 tick, starting on the next page with our hardware inspection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is without headphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's latest retail packaging is made entirely of recycled paper and printed with soy-ink. It's also 100% recyclable and eco-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 comes with the standard set of accessories you'd expect in a smartphone's retail box, with the notable absence of headphones. Otherwise, the A/C adapter that you need to use is here, alongside the supplied microUSB cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 N5110 measures 210.8 x 135.9 x 8mm, which makes is slightly thicker, but almost the same width and height as the iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight-wise, the Note 8.0 comes in about 338 g, or about 25 grams heavier than the mini. Whether or not the extra heft is worth it depends on your need for an S Pen and the Wacom digitizer that comes with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design ethos takes after what was first introduced by the Samsung Galaxy S III. Although you won't be confusing the two anytime soon, it's easy to see that the two devices are signed by the same manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must say the hyperglaze finish somehow manages to look better on a bigger scale. The front panel of the Note 8.0 has several interesting elements other than the screen. Above it is the 1.9MP front-facing camera and proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the ambient light sensor, we have to note that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 got the same RGB sensor as the Note II, the one that's capable of detecting the full spectrum of the ambient light, rather than just its green channel. This leads to improved performance under some types of artificial lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As in other recent devices, Samsung has a way of controlling brightness without disabling automatic mode. You define an offset, so your Galaxy Note 8.0 screen will always be slightly brighter or dimmer than the automatically selected level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the classic arrangement of physical hardware Home key flanked by the capacitive Menu and Back keys. This layout has been in use since the early days of the Galaxy line and Samsung decided not to put the Android keys on-screen (as Google dictates) even on a screen this big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This, by the way, makes the Note 8.0 one of the very few Android-powered tablets with a hardware Home key, which puts it in the same bracket with no other than the Apple iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Note 8.0 hold no surprises either, a microSD card slot on the left and a Power/Lock key, volume rocker, and IR-port on the right. The 3G/LTE enabled N5100 version of the tablet has a SIM compartment of course on the left as well. We're testing the Wi-Fi only N5110 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 features only the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a pair of speakers at the bottom, on either side of the microUSB port. The microUSB port handles charging and data connections with a computer, and is MHL-enabled, so you can output HD video via an HDMI adapter or enable USB Host via another adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having the stereo speakers at the bottom isn't the best possible decision. The front-facing landscape oriented speakers on the Note 10.1 are by far superior for both gaming and multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stylus slot is at the bottom too, with the top of the S Pen curved to fit the shape of the Note 8.0. The stylus itself isn't perfectly round like the original stylus, so it doesn't rotate in the slot, making it easier to put back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's little of note at the back of the tablet. The 5MP camera lens is centrally placed at the top, slightly protruding so the Note 8.0 rests on it when placed on a level surface, but its hardened glass is not too easy to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, holding the device in one hand across the back is possible - but it wouldn't be a lot more comfortable than the iPad mini. With a 4:3 screen, the Apple tablet is anything but narrow - and the Note 8.0 is even slightly wider, mostly on account of bigger screen bezel. Other than that, the device looks reasonably good in white and can be comfortably used with two hands in landscape mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A pretty good display for the class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Note 8.0 has a standard LCD - Samsung has given up AMOLED in tablets for the time being with the Galaxy Tab 7.7 remaining its only attempt so far. And this is said not without regret. AMOLED screens are now reserved for the Note phablets, while tablets get LCDs. The one in the Note 8.0 gets the job done. It has 1280 x 800 pixel resolution, which results in 189ppi and a 16:10 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the display quality is understandably far from what you'd see on a new 1080p flagship smartphone, for example, it's fairly crisp to the naked eye, and offers a sharper image than many of Samsung's other tablet offerings, such as the Tab 2 7.0. It also beats out Apple's iPad mini in terms of ppi. Here's a closer look at the display matrices of each device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and Apple iPad mini screens up close</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is good, if not the best around and colors are nice, resulting in image quality that's generally superior than the Apple offering. Still legibility in direct sun is pretty bad and viewing angles aren't the best around, particularly if you are coming from a high end smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest tablet from Samsung runs TouchWiz-skinned Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, the same combo you'll see on the Note II, complete with additional S-Pen support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see our usual user interface video here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have been repeatedly impressed by what S-pen-enabled devices from Samsung can do and the Note 8.0 is no exception. Custom features and options literally spring from every nook and cranny, so you better get comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that because this is the WiFi-only version, options and settings related to calling will understandably be absent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock" deal and there're ripples accompanied by water-drop sound as you drag your finger. Five customizable shortcuts are available at the bottom of the screen - drag one up to launch the app without going through the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several options for the unlock screen. You can enable a news ticker at the bottom of the lockscreen, which is a great way to stay up to date on current events. The ticker can be expanded to view all news items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are alternative unlock routines as well - Face unlock, Face and voice unlock, unlock by touching the screen and tilting the phone and starting the camera from the lockscreen by touching the screen and rotating the phone horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are voice-based wakeup commands that can just start S Voice or launch a preselected app. You can also enable a second clock on the lockscreen, which shows up when you're roaming. Most of these features can be switched off too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you make it past the lockscreen, you'll notice that the dock at the bottom of the screen now fits six shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one opens the app drawer as usual, but you can change the other five to any shortcut you like or even folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area looks familiar, but there are a few new things that make good use of the big screen. On top is a clock with the date and a Settings shortcut. Below that are the usual toggles - Wi-Fi, GPS, Reading mode, Vibrate and Screen rotation. There are five more toggles just off screen - Bluetooth, Power saving, Blocking mode (we'll get to that later), Sync and Multi window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down we get the Brightness slider with an Auto checkbox. It allows you to adjust the brightness even in auto mode - the backlight strength is still adjusted according to ambient lighting conditions, but you can tweak it to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications are one of the big changes in Jelly Bean. Notifications can now take more than a single row to display more information and they can also have more advanced controls on them (e.g. a reply button). The top notification is expanded by default and you can expand/collapse notifications with a two finger swipe up or down (not all notifications can be expanded though, only those that support it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, at the very bottom of the screen you get a line for connected WiFi network, which turns into "No internet connection" when there isn't a network available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following convention from stock Android, the app drawer has a tab that lets you easily pull out widgets to the homescreen. Unlike the stock app drawer, you cannot move between tabs by swiping through the pages - you have to explicitly hit the tab. There's a download shortcut on the right, which brings you to a screen with only the downloaded apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has two view modes - Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons) and Alphabetical grid (if you think you can find apps quicker if they're alphabetized).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has a zoomed-out overview that lets you rearrange pages, but you can't create blanks. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling 'tap to uninstall' mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. Swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the task manager, the Note 8.0 comes with Multi-window, which you can access using the small tab on the left side of the interface. This lets you run two apps side by side on the screen. You can adjust the division line giving one app more space than the other. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few Samsung-made tweaks here - a button at the bottom of the list to bring out the home-brewed task manager, a button to end all apps at once and a shortcut to Google Now. By the way, you can also bring up Google Now by pressing and holding the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go back to the homescreen and widgets. Jelly Bean comes with plenty of them and Samsung has added more still. With Android 4.1, the widgets will move out of the way if you try and put something over them, which makes reorganizing the homescreen so much easier. Some widgets are resizable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and easily manage homescreen panes - add, delete (but you can't have more than seven) or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use full-screen widgets. One of these panes is marked "default" and that will be the one you're taken to when you press the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the regular homescreen panes, there are also dedicated panes, which Samsung calls Page Buddy - for the S Pen, for earphones, for a dock etc. You can enable and disable these pages individually and each page gets launched automatically triggered by its corresponding accessory (e.g. pulling out the S Pen or plugging in a headset).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regular homescreen panes are indicated by dots but the dedicated pages get a special pictogram (e.g. a pen for the S Pen, headphones for the Earphone page and so on). You can put whatever widgets you like here (and they are resizable as usual). For example, the S Pen page has the S Note widget by default, while the Earphone page has music and video player control widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not all either. While one of these pages is active (e.g. the S Pen is out) you get a row of recommended shortcuts in the notification area and the dock at the bottom of the screen mirrors those shortcuts (our only complaint here is that the shortcuts cannot be customized).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live wallpapers are a great way to decorate your homescreen, but also make it useful too. The News wall creates an attractive slideshow of headlines, while Stock wall does the same for quotes. Photo wall creates a collage of photos from your Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a setting called Mode change - basically, it gives you two separate homescreen setups, Standard and Easy. Samsung's idea is to give you big, easy to use widgets that cover most of the functionality with Easy mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing stopping you from adding back the regular widgets in Easy mode, so you can use Mode change to toggle between personal and work widget setups. You can't rename the modes or have more than two, but it's a potentially useful feature if your precious few homescreens are usually cluttered with widgets you use for work and so on, and you want personal widgets instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S pen features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S pen truly is pivotal to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 experience. First introduced with the Galaxy Note, it has a vast array of special features that are a great improvement over what can be done with just your fingertips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already covered the contextual page, which comes up automatically when you pull out the S Pen. It's only visible when the stylus is out and its icon is a little pencil, while regular homescreens are still indicated by dots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there's another way to launch apps - with gestures. You press the S Pen button and swipe up to access Quick command. Here you can draw a "@" sign to launch email, "?" to do a quick search, "!" to launch Maps, among others. Besides the symbol you can add a keyword - what to search for with the "?" or define search range for the "@": recipient, message body or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add new commands too - just pick a function (e.g. enable Bluetooth, there's a long list to choose from) and write on the symbol you want to associate with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also hover the S Pen over various things to get a better look at - expand S Planner events, preview emails and text, preview videos and even a point on the video timeline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen also lets you quickly snap a portion of the screen and use it in an app - email, S Note, etc. Speaking of S Note, you can launch it by double tapping with the S Pen while holding down its button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung came out with S Voice as an answer to Apple's Siri before Google came out with its own solution in Google Now. S Voice is the culmination of Samsung's ongoing effort at integrating voice commands, which began with Vlingo back in the day - you may remember the voice activation (saying "Hi Galaxy" to trigger S Voice).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice can do the usual - search the web, make calls, send texts (which Android natively supports and so does Vlingo), but you can also use it instead of notification area toggles, to answer or reject incoming calls, start the camera and take a photo, and control the music player and stop or snooze alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also a tool for quickly looking up facts - it's powered by Wolfram Alpha (which handles some of Siri's answers too). It has an enormous database covering topics ranging from Culture and Media to Physics. S Voice can also be used as a calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has decided to keep S Voice alongside Google's solution as the two do differ in functionality. Jelly Bean has the unspoken Google Now info cards, but it also features Google's Knowledge Graph, which can answer factual questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Voice Actions can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. It can't, however, toggle Wi-Fi or control the camera, among other things that S Voice can do. At least not yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is powered by a Samsung-made Exynos 4412 Quad-core chipset with four Cortex-A9 cores clocked at 1.6GHz, 2GB of RAM and a Mali-400 GPU. We've put it head to head with some of the best quad-cores around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It features the same internals as the Samsung Galaxy Note II, and while that may have been enough to top the charts back when the Note II was released, the pack has moved on since.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Benchmark Pi the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 scores about the same as the Galaxy Note II, but is largely bested by most of the recently announced flagships out there.

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging sans 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online and messages are displayed as usual, or you can switch to a Gmail-like conversation view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 8.0 also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a synch schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. There's also Samsung's own ChatOn service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - keyboard, S Pen or else<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 comes with several text input options. Yes, there is handwriting recognition using the S Pen, but even the standard on-screen QWERTY has several different layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big screen makes for comfortable portrait typing, and we appreciate the extra row just for the numbers. Two finger typing is comfortable on the Note 8.0 in portrait mode, but becomes a pain in landscape. Samsung was thoughtful enough to include a nifty split keyboard which made typing in these situations easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right on the keyboard to position the cursor. Okay, this isn't new but this is - you can hover over a text field with the S Pen and a cursor appears. You have to tap to position it there. The keyboard can also be made into a type of floating widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype). This is available on the Galaxy S III too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to handwriting recognition, it's very accurate (even with our awful penmanship) and the thicker, longer S Pen helps quite a bit to improve the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 has very advanced text prediction features to minimize typos. If you let it, it will scan through your emails, Facebook posts and Twitter posts and learn how you write (which words you use more often and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and since the Galaxy Note 8.0 is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this will work even if the tablet is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Galaxy Note 8.0 is smart about picking which text input method to show you. If you tap a field with you finger, it will bring up the QWERTY keyboard. If you tap a field with the S Pen instead, it will launch the handwriting recognition.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery loaded with features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 comes with a brand new, visually-appealing Gallery app. It opens up in Albums view, but photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces), Group and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also switch between three view modes - rectangular grid, a grid that's spread out in 3D space and a 3D spiral (which is the least useful of all). In each of the three view modes, you can pinch zoom to make the thumbnails bigger. Unlike Sony's gallery, you only get two zoom levels here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open an album, the app switches to split screen mode. The left side shows the folders, while the right displays all the photos in a rectangular grid. You can also use Air View to take a peek at what's inside a folder without opening it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find Star, Share and Delete buttons above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also found that unlike other droids, the Galaxy Note 8.0 lets you select several different folders for batch operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of features goes on. There are a couple of photo editing options (downloadable from the Samsung Apps Store) and a crop tool. You can add an image note by scribbling over it with the S Pen (or your finger) and this is not ruining the image. Contextual tags display labels with the location, as well as id the people in the photo and show the date (if there's a GPS tag and you've taught the Note 8.0 about what your friends look like). Then there's the print option, so you can print out photos without going through a computer first (but you'll need a Samsung printer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces in it, the Galaxy Note 8.0 will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize who is who automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you thought that Samsung didn't include the kitchen sink, the option to add weather tags to a photo (a feature courtesy of AccuWeather) should change your mind. We still can't figure out what the use for that may be.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player goes after Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 uses an updated version of the TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted into various categories, but the most interesting one is called Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection - and therefore your mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to move between songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 8.0 player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have put what is easily the best default video player on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. It offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is a true quad-core tour de force - the visible video thumbnails (all eight of them) are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome preview and it shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature that showcases the power of the Exynos chipset is the chapter preview - it detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn't a problem either - the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 played FullHD files. Large files worked seamlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 also made a good impression when it offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Note 8.0 has a feature called Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nicely clean audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 matches the audio output of its Note 10.1 bigger brother, delivering excellent scores all over the field when connected to an active external amplifier. Unfortunately it also fails to address the average volume levles issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the output is still impressively clean. The stereo crosstalk does go up, but the rest of the readings are barely affected, adding up to a very solid overall performance. Sadly, volume levels remain about the same, robbing the Note 8.0 of the best audio output in business title.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera does decently<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Note 8.0's main camera can capture stills of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels and 720p videos, while the one on the front takes 1.3MP pictures and VGA video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is typical for a Samsung droid - a right column with the essential controls (virtual shutter key surrounded by a still/video mode toggle and a gallery shortcut) and a left column with six customizable shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app offers a bounty of features including geotagging, touch focus, Panorama, Smile shot, face and smile detection with Best faces, low-light mode, scenes, effects and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual image quality is pretty good for a 5 megapixel camera. There's lots of fine detail and the noise levels are kept under control. Colors are decent too if slightly on the cold side. That being said the Note 8.0 is by far not the most comfortable device to take out and about and shoot a lot of photos with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera user interface is identical to that of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus during recording is available, with an AF button to switch back to regular continuous autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are recorded in MP4 files with bitrate of 12Mbps. The framerate is a solid 30fps and the audio is captured in stereo at 48kHz sampling rate and a bitrate of 128Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are since long nothing impressive for a premium gadget and the Galaxy Note 8.0 samples aren't all that impressive either. Clips lacks resolved detail and the colors look bland even in well-lit environments.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Limited connectivity features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 has the basic connectivity features, but not as many as you'll see on the likes of, say, the Note II. Since we have the WiFi-only version, there's no GSM connectivity to speak of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility and Wi-Fi Direct. The tablet also has Bluetooth 4.0 support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AllShare Play can be used for transferring and sharing data and multimedia files to your notebook or PC via WiFi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group Play, introduced recently from Samsung, allows you to cast pictures, documents, or music to other devices with the app which are on the same WiFi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One advantage the Note 8.0 has over most of the competition is its infrared port. The port is used via the Peel app, which allows the Note to act as a controller for television sets of numerous brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. Sadly, there isn't one included in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy Note 8.0 screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Awesome web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new Android version always comes with an improved web browser and the Jelly Bean browser running on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is no exception. Samsung has put its own spin to it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is almost non-existent - just a row at the top of the screen for the back and forward buttons, the URL bar with a refresh button, the tab switching key and the bookmarks key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as find on page, save for offline viewing, request desktop site and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can expect, the S Pen also comes into play when using the browser. With it, you can hover over elements of the page as you would with a mouse (very, very few smartphones can do this and this is the first to do it properly). This comes in quite convenient for all those sites that haven't updated their interface yet to work well on a touchscreen (where you can tap something, but not hover over it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the S Pen to do quick web searches - just swipe up with the S Pen button pressed to launch Quick command and then scribble your query.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Samsung feature in the browser is the Print option, which lets you print out web pages straight from your phone. Unfortunately, this only works only with Samsung printers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls are our favorite feature of the Android browser and they've gotten even better with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. In case you've missed it, Quick Controls is basically a jog-dial menu that replaces the buttons on the top and appears when you place your finger near the left or right edge of the screen. It's even more minimalist than the regular UI and it's very comfortable to use single-handed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get five controls, but as you highlight one with your finger, it fans out into further options. The tabs, for example, brings out the tab switcher by default, but it also brings out options to open a new tab, a new incognito tab or close the current tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness and colors gives you four different presets to adjust the display. Automatic brightness is an option, too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 comes with a good selection of preinstalled apps. A lot of them are centered on the S Pen, but there are some other nice additions as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First comes the Polaris Office document viewer. It lets you open word files, pdf's, spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, as well as connect to various cloud services such as Box, Dropbox, and Google Docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner is a skinned calendar (the only one you get on the Note 8.0) that is equally easy to use with fingers and with the S Pen. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, month, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner can sync with multiple calendar and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Note app offers several templates and you can enter handwritten notes, regular text with the on-screen keyboard (or handwriting recognition), complex mathematical formulas along with images and voice notes. You can also hit the record button to record the process of drawing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a floating window version of the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled their new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Note 8.0. It can sync contacts, calendar and S notes and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Cloud can also hook up to Dropbox. If you do this, photos and videos from your Dropbox account will be synced with the tablet's gallery. You can have the Note 8.0 sync those photos and videos only over Wi-Fi to save on data usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly, instead of a clock app, the Note 8.0 features a few applications which perform some - but not all - of the same functions. Alarm lets you create alarms which can be set to go off not only at various times, but during certain days of the week as well. The World Clock pops up the various cities on a globe, letting you select them for a quick overview the local time zone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, but you can enable one-handed operation to make things more manageable. The text size is adjustable and if you flip the Note 8.0 horizontally, you get some advanced math functions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app has an interface similar to that of the gallery, though that one is available only in landscape mode. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Paper Artist imports a photo and runs a filter over it (there are plenty to choose from). Then you can go in with the S Pen and color certain areas.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 has access to the latest apps and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space. Still, keep in mind that some apps might have issues with JB at first, but those should be ironed out soon enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A few generations of the Galaxy Tab into the tablet game, Samsung has been mostly watching Apple and the iPads. And we mean watching them pull away into the distance in terms of sales.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not like the Koreans were doing too many things wrong. The Galaxy 7.7 was a brilliant device in its time, though perhaps in hindsight overpriced - no wonder AMOLED has hardly ever returned on tablets since. The Galaxy Note 10.1 was delayed more than usual to get a quad-core chipset but somehow couldn't make up for lost time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a nutshell, Samsung has consistently failed to make a meaningful difference in tablets. And this must hurt a company that's been setting the standard in phablets and smartphones. To make things worse, from a certain point on it wasn't just Apple they had to watch out for. The eight-inch Galaxy Note is clearly Samsung's response to the iPad mini, but the Amazon Kindle Fires and the Google Nexus 7 have managed to stir things up in the compact tablet class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to have any hopes of competing at the price levels set by the Kindle Fire and the Nexus tablet, manufacturers like Samsung and Apple had no choice but to reduce the costs of their tablet offerings, and as we all know, reducing costs means cutting corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Galaxy Note 8.0, that results in getting rid of a portion of the features we've become used to getting from Samsung - NFC, FM Radio as well as a couple of Smart features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of the iPad mini, Apple were looking to build on the success of the bigger iPads by sacrificing the defining feature (Retina display) for improved portability and greater affordability. The iPad mini's 7.9" screen is nothing spectacular at 768 x 1024 pixels. The Mini has only a quarter of the RAM at 512 MB, and the dual-core 1 GHz processor cannot match up to the Note's quad-core.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, even with all of the cost reductions, it's hard to compete with the ultra-low price of the Kindle Fire HD, which can be currently bought off of Amazon for $184. However the highly customized Android build has resulted in axing so many features that the Amazon slate is not even in the same league in terms of productivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides you will be giving quite a few hardware perks - the screen is smaller (at the same resolution), there's only half the amount of RAM and no GPS. Also, the dual-core 1.2 GHz TI OMAP processor is significantly slower. In the end, the Fires are gadgets to consume content on - unable to match the versatility of the Galaxy Note 8.0 with an S pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Amazon Kindle Fire HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google made quite the splash with a 7" tablet of its own in the ASUS-made Nexus 7. Its 7-inch screen offers better pixel density and there's Gorilla Glass protection but it comes at the expense of poorer image quality. The Nexus also only has half the amount of RAM, but the quad-core 1.2 GHz Nvidia Tegra 3 chipset performs decently in benchmarks, and as an added bonus you get Android updates on time and straight from Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Google Nexus 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all of these alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that none can give you the same great stylus integration as the S-pen-enabled Note 8.0. And we don't just mean that as an incentive for designers and casual scribblers. The Note's Wacom input is second to none - the S pen is a fun experience but can be a productivity boost too, along with offering a novel way of interacting with the device. And when you couple that with Samsung's extensive software package, and the full-featured telephony (on the 3G/LTE enabled versions), the Note 8.0 is a compelling offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a second thought though, so were the Tab 7.7 and the Note 10.1. The Galaxy Note 8.0 is a package that makes sense but it seems imperative that Samsung make it genuinely affordable. And this one hasn't only got the competition to worry about but Samsung's very own phablets too.</paragraph>
