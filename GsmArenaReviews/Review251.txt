			<paragraph>Almost a dozen of new Nokia handsets have been announced recently. They are by no means high-end devices, however many of them have the potential of gaining some serious ground on the budget-oriented or mid-range market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 1680 classic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 1680 classic seems like the successor of the Nokia 1650 - at least they share a rather common design. Dubbed as the most affordable cameraphone to date, the Nokia 1680 classic offers a basic VGA camera with video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 1680 classic also offers an email client, GPRS/EDGE support, and MP3 ringtones. It has a 65K color TFT display with 128 x 160 pixels resolution, but unfortunately there's no Bluetooth available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 1680 classic has a simple and conservative design. Much like the Nokia 1650 the keypad is made of a single-piece rubber mat to prevent dust and dirt accumulating between the keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 1680 classic will be available in Black, Slate Grey, Wine Red and Deep Plum in Q2 2008 for around 50 euro before subsides and taxes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 2680 slide<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2680 Slide is another entry level phone again with a VGA camera. It has a 65K color TFT display with a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels and sports Bluetooth, FM radio and MP3 ringtones support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2680 is a simple slider which strives to compete with the successful South Korean alternatives by Samsung and LG. The lively colors just might be the thing that would snatch some customers for Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An email client and GPRS/EDGE support are also present. The Nokia 2680 Slide will be available in Slate Gray, Night Blue, Orange and Violet in Q3 2008 for an approximate price of 75 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 7070 Prism<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 7070 Prism is a compact dual-band clamshell. It has a 65K TFT display with a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels and weighs only 78 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also sports up to 11MB of user memory for storing MP3 ringtones. It also has GPRS support and an email client. Unfortunately, there's no USB or Bluetooth support to transfer files. A built-in camera is also absent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first two Prism handsets were pretentiously advertised as fashionable devices. The Nokia 7070 Prism certainly doesn't follow the same line. It looks all-plastic at first sight, but the matt/shiny diamond combo all over the body managed to win us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it's open the Nokia 7070 Prism has rather seamless looks as if it's made of one whole piece - you can hardly notice where the hinge mechanism lies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED triangle on the front panel indicates of missed system events with some nice colorful blinking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 7070 Prism will be available with either a Pink or Blue accent for around 50 euro in Q3 2008.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5000<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5000 flaunts a thin 11.1 mm design and a number of lively colors. It boasts a 1.3 megapixel camera, FM radio, a music player and Bluetooth support. There's also GPRS, EDGE and email support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5000 runs on the S40 user interface and its probably greatest advantage is the QVGA resolution of its 2-inch 65K color TFT display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5000 looks as if it has the XpressMusic logo all over, however it doesn't belong to the music-centric Nokia lineup. It has nice feature pack though and offers some really cool and fresh colors. Nokia should really catch up on the ultra thin handsets and we hope the Nokia 5000 is a nice step in that direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5000 will be available in Cyber Green, Neon Blue and Perfect Purple in Q2 2008 somewhere in Q2 2008 for around 90 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5220 XpressMusic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5220 XpressMusic offers unconventional asymmetrical bar-shaped design and a clean-cut slim body with a total thickness of only 10.5mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5220 XpressMusic of course hosts a number of music features such as dedicated music keys, light effects that pulse with the music rhythm, stereo FM radio with RDS, stereo Bluetooth (A2DP), a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD memory card slot for storing your music on cards with up to 2GB of capacity (a 512MB card included). The manufacturer also promises the whopping 24 hours of continuous playback time with a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other features of the Nokia 5220 XpressMusic include a 2 megapixel snapper, a 2-inch QVGA 262K color TFT display, and a microUSB port. With the Nokia 5220 will come with an organic wallpaper that changes actively throughout the day, Opera Mini web browser, Yahoo! Go and Yahoo! Ready and support for Macromedia Adobe Flash (think YouTube!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The asymmetrical design is the first thing that catches your eye in the Nokia 5220. The colored overlays that denote the music keys functions are the ones that blink in tune with the music (the abovementioned light effects). Overall, combined with the irregular design they create a really nice impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5220 XpressMusic will be available in Q3 2008 for around 160 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 3600 slide<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last of the bunch, the Nokia 3600 slide also has some neat features in store for would-be owners. Its sliding body again has some high-gloss surfaces with gradated colors, metallic elements and soft ceramic paint. Beside the 2.2-inch QVGA 16M color TFT display, the Nokia 3600 slide also boasts a 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera capable of capturing VGA MPEG4 videos at 15 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3600 slide is the first Nokia handset to feature Background Noise Cancellation for superior sound quality. It's got a 2.5 mm standard audio jack which serves the double purpose of a TV-out port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connectivity-wise, the Nokia 3600 slide packs quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support (no 3G) and Bluetooth. The microSD memory card slot is capable of using cards with a capacity of up to 4GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the Nokia 3600 slide looks familiar to you are not alone. It looks like an elder brother of the Nokia 2680 slide we already showed you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3600 slide will be available in Charcoal and Wine colors in Q3 2008 at an estimated retail price of 175 euro before taxes and subsidies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6600 fold<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 fold is a clamshell offering a one-click electromagnetic opening mechanism with dampened hinge for smooth motion and flaunts an unusual combination of materials such as a smooth back surface and high-gloss front panel. The high-gloss surface is a real fingerprint magnet but it really does look the part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, a double tap on the Nokia 6600 slide can snooze an alert, silence or reject a call or simply wake up the hidden external 128 x 160 pixel display in order to visualize the clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The electromagnetic mechanism comprises of a thin strip above the display and an electromagnet below the keypad. Once you press the opening key on the right hand side of the Nokia 6600 fold it opens smoothly all the way up. Of course you need the handset to be on for the feature to work, since it requires battery power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's off, you can still open the clamshell of course, but you can't make use of the electromagnetic lock. As a whole it's an intriguing feature that manages to strike you with its novelty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 fold has a QVGA 2.13-inch 16M color OLED display and a 2 megapixel camera with dual-LED flash. In terms of network connectivity, the Nokia 6600 fold is able to offer quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE plus dual-band UMTS support with video calls. The device is based on the Nokia Series 40 user interface and will have support for microSD memory cards with a capacity of up to 4GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 fold will be available in Q3 2008 in Mysterious Black and Sophisticated Purple at an estimated price of 275 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6600 slide<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 slide builds on the same well-known name but again doesn't offer the smartphone functionality of the original Nokia 6600. The new slider has the same double tap feature of the 6600 fold and also has some interesting materials used such as glossy surfaces and steel covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 slide is again based on the S40 user interface and has a QVGA 2.2-inch 16M color TFT display. In the same time it remains compact enough. The 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera is also capable of recording VGA resolution video clips at 15fps (in 3GP format). The Nokia 6600 slide also has a FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connectivity features include quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and dual-band UMTS with video calls, Bluetooth and a microUSB connectivity port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 slide will be available in Q3 2008 at an estimated price of 250 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>
