			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The RAZR line that Android helped revive is to be looked at with nothing but pride but Motorola should realize it had more luck than others. Giants like Siemens and Alcatel that used to shape the industry have been almost completely wiped from the map, while Moto stayed afloat and was acquired by no other than Google - the company behind the most popular smartphone platform in the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola is of course a founding member of the Open Handset Alliance, and that was well before Google's fat check, but competing with white box manufacturers over $50 dual and triple-SIM handsets wasn't such a distant possibility. Instead, Motorola is now flirting with edge-to-edge displays, steel frames and Kevlar to produce another stunning-looking phone like the RAZR i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really loved the Krait-powered sibling of the Motorola RAZR i - the Motorola DROID RAZR M - and we look to the Intel-driven version to deliver more of the same. Here's the quick rundown of what it has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new 32nm Medfield platform has finally seen smartphones break the 2GHz barrier and Intel claim this should be more beneficial to the user experience than multi-core architecture. Now, we were very pleased with the dual-core Krait inside the RAZR M, and it will take more than PR talk to change our mind, but you can rest assured the RAZR i will be given a fair chance to persuade us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, even if the Motorola RAZR i fails to top the benchmarks, it would still have a nice set of useful tools for surviving in the highly competitive mid-range. The smartphone has the build and finish of a high-end device and that alone is certain to get many people interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the ample battery and the edge-to-edge display which, Motorola says, puts even the iPhone 5 to shame, when it comes to making the most out of the available space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i comes in an average sized box, which holds the usual set of accessories - a wall-mount plug, which has a USB slot on its side, a microUSB cable, a set of headphones as well as a tool for removing the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card supplied or any other nice surprises in the box, but considering that even high-end phones of late fail to offer such extras, we aren't vastly disappointed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola RAZR i XT890 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the Motorola RAZR i's key selling points is its extremely compact body. Standing at 122.5 x 60.9 x 8.3 mm this is one of the most compact smartphones around and certainly the most compact to pack a screen of this size. Moto likes to call the display edge-to-edge and while that's not entirely true and there is some bezel left, the RAZR i still does a great job of utilizing the available space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 126 g nails the balance between hand feel and comfort of use. Single-handed use is a breeze - and that's easier said than done on a 4.3" screen. There's a reassuring heft to the RAZR i, the kind of solid feel we've been missing since the Nokia E-series, and yet, it's not a burden to carry around and easily slips into pockets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i looks identical to its DROID RAZR M cousin, which we reviewed a few weeks ago. We're quite fond of that industrial look with visible bolts on the sides, the aluminum frame and the Kevlar back making a nice mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no denying that the choice of materials is pretty impressive for a midranger, too. Motorola has made Kevlar the RAZR family's signature element, but metal is also getting increasingly hard to come by lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only grudge we have with the Motorola RAZR i exterior is the visible gap at the sides where the two halves of the body meet. That's just about the only aspect of the phone's build that looks cheap, especially when the gap fills with dust.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will find the usual bunch of sensors, the earpiece and front-facing camera, as well as a tiny status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing but the mouthpiece below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port, microSIM, and microSD card slots are located on the phone's left side. The card slots share a thin plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side, you will find the power/lock key, as well as the volume rocker and the camera key. The bad news is the shutter key has no half press. On the upside, it will power up the camera even when the device is locked - and it's a near instant launch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We find it rather strange though that the three buttons on this side are all made of different materials and have different colors. It gives this particular profile of the smartphone a cheapish look and we would have really preferred if Moto avoided it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unprotected 3.5mm audio jack is located at the top of the Motorola RAZR i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're no functional elements whatsoever on the Motorola RAZR i tapered bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera, the LED flash, and the loudspeaker are located at the top of the RAZR i's splash resistant back. The Intel inside logo is also here to indicate the unusual chipset that's powering this smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i is powered by an ample 2000mAh battery, which combined with the energy efficient display of fairly modest resolution, was expected to do pretty well in our battery test. The Intel chipset is a mystery to us, but having seen the Motorola DROID RAZR M do well here, we would be shocked if the RAZR i failed to match its sibling's battery backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i managed to achieve the almost unbelievable endurance rating of 64h. This means that if you were to use the smartphone for an hour of talking, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video playback per day, you'd need to charge it once every 64 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR i battery test results</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reason for the extremely impressive performance seems to be the Intel-designed modem that the RAZR i employs. While the smartphone is hardly the longest lasting when it comes to video playback and web browsing, it blasted the competition when it came to talk time and stand-by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that if you are the power-user kind that uses their smartphone more for non-telephony-related activities than actual talking activities you are likely to need to charge way more often than its test result suggests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>PenTile Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i's qHD Super AMOLED Advanced display is a pretty familiar sight. Debuting on the Motorola RAZR XT910 last year, the 4.3" display uses a PenTile matrix, as opposed to the conventional RGB arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that even though its pixel density stands at the pleasing 256 ppi, the perceivable sharpness is far lower on many occasions. This leads to the familiar dottiness, which can be unpleasant when trying to read fine text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast on the other hand is perfect, as it has always been on AMOLED screens, while the viewing angles and sunlight legibility are pretty good too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can find more information on our display test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Motorola RAZR i screen is pretty good, but 720p screens flying left and right these days, put the smartphone squarely in the mid-range category. qHD might not be bad, but it's no longer associated with high-end devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling the Motorola RAZR i is a pleasure. The compact body allows for easy one-handed operation, while the grippy Kevlar-covered back makes accidental drops unlikely. You will find nothing to frown at here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Motorola RAZR i receives nothing but high marks for design and finish, and while its build quality could be better, the impressions it makes are extremely positive. It certainly feels more expensive than it actually is but that's not an end in itself - the RAZR i aslo very comfortable to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming up next is a look at the software talents of the RAZR i.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with a light Motorola touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i runs almost stock Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, with an occasional custom touch here and there. The overall experience is very close to pure Android - starting from the on-screen buttons, all the way to the app drawer, transition effects and the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a quick video of the RAZR i user interface to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the few areas Motorola has customized is the lock screen. It features a standard display of current date and time as well as a handy toggle to put the smartphone in silent mode. Pressing on the round unlock button in the center of the lockscreen unveils four different options. One of them is straight unlock, with three added app shortcuts - Camera, Messages and Phone. Sadly, these are not user configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you go past the lockscreen, you see the homescreen, which breaks down to seven panes to fill with widgets and apps. Switching between panes is seamless with a handy indicator above the docked applications showing you which homescreen you are on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add or remove panes pinch-to-zoom on any of the homescreens to get to the Manage pages screen. From there you can add additional panes tapping on the plus icon or remove a pane by simply pushing it off the stack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has added a neat option allowing you to choose either a blank slate or a template. The latter provides you with a pane filled with app shortcuts and widgets geared toward specific activities such as social networking, entertainment, office, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens come with yet another twist. There's an extra quick settings screen left from the leftmost homescreen pane. It's populated with commonly used connectivity toggles such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile data, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the opposite end of your active homescreen panes is the Add a page interface - you can swipe all the way, instead of doing the pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the homescreen gives you the option to change the handset's wallpapers. You can do so for both the lock and the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has been taken straight from the stock version of Android ICS. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets - that break down to side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you move into the Widgets tab. There's also a Google Play store shortcut next to the tabs, for quicker access to Android's app repository.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create folders in the familiar ICS way. All you have to do is drag the icon over the one you want to pair it with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must note that there aren't many preloaded widgets. However, Motorola's own Circles widget is one of the most likeable we've tried. It offers you access to the clock, weather in different cities, as well as a battery indicator. Flipping any of the three circles (like flipping a coin) switches to an alternative view. The clock can be either digital or analog, while the weather and battery indicator reveal their settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is stock ICS. It shows you icons next to the notification, such as the picture of the person who called or messaged you. There's a Settings shortcut for quick access to the phone's preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stock Ice Cream Sandwich, the Recent apps list hasn't been customized either. It displays thumbnails of the running applications rather than icons in a vertical, scrollable list. You can dismiss apps with a simple swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall user interface experience on the Intel-powered Motorola RAZR i is quite pleasant. The UI has been lightly, but expertly customized, helping it retain most of the pure Google feel - not a bad thing in our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, Motorola could've added some more clever widgets and the occasional live wallpaper, but let's not nitpick.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i is powered by a single-core Intel Atom Z2460 processor on the Medfield platform. The CPU runs at 2GHz and is paired with a PowerVR SGX 540 GPU. Don't be put down by the fact that it's a single-core chip amidst dual and quad-core rivals. The Atom Z2460 supports hyper-threading, which basically enables one physical processor to process two threads simultaneously (this is to say it can act as a dual-core CPU).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the base clock of the Atom Z2460 is 1.3GHz, as it only runs on 2GHz when needed. The clock speed is impressive indeed and Intel even went on to say that it's not coming at the expense of power consumption. Judging by the results from our battery test that's obviously true and the fact that the chipset is built on a 32nm process, probably helps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected to see a dominant performance from the Motorola RAZR i in the BenchmarkPi test. This benchmark is not optimized to make use of multi-core architectures and since the RAZR i has the core with the highest clock speed, we really though it would crush the competition here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turns out, the Intel CPU failed miserably here, coming a long way behind the Krait-packing competitors and even failing to match the scores of those with Cortex-A9 CPUs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i suffered another convincing defeat at Quadrant, which is an overall performance benchmark, but at least this time it came much closer to its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We moved on to the GPU-stressing NenaMark 2 test. Intel said that it has increased the GPU speed after moving to the 32nm process and there is indeed a small speed boost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's still the same old PowerVR SGX540 GPU though, so it doesn't stack up very well against newer designs like the ULP GeForce, Mali-400MP or the Adreno 225. In fact we're already discontinuing the usage of NenaMark 2 for newer chipsets, as they all manage to reach the 60 fps limit of the screens and the benchmark doesn't produce accurate results. The Razr i, on the other hand, managed just 39.7 fps, which might do for most uses, but is still rather disappointing for a smartphone in this price range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the Intel processor excels is JavaScript performance. In the SunSpider benchmark, the RAZR i managed a hugely impressive score, beating many of its elite competitors. Obviously, the optimizations that Intel made to the RAZR i JavaScript engine are paying off quite nicely here. We've also included the scores of the Intel-powered Motorola smartphone when using the Chrome browser, in case that's what you are going to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i fell a bit further down the ranks in the other browser-based benchmark we ran, but its achievement is still commendable. Beating a couple of quad-core beasts and its Krait-powered US sibling is quite the achievement, considering that the raw power of the chipset is obviously not exactly great.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i comes with the standard Ice Cream Sandwich phonebook. Motorola hasn't done much in terms of customization here, but this isn't necessary a bad thing. The phonebook is divided into three tabs - Groups, People and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People tab is in the middle and is the default one. It displays a list of all contacts. They are listed with their name and a picture on the left. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with their last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account) while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbs friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and drag to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. Regular search is there, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all details available. In true ICS fashion, there's a large contact picture on top. You can mark the contact as a favorite by tapping on the star on the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to it is the menu button from which you can edit the contact, join it with a duplicate one or set it a special ringtone. There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's also a plus sign below a category - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the X sign right next to it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the phonebook covers all the basics, but lacks the bells and whistles of the more enhanced and feature-rich likes of TouchWiz and SenseUI. In any case, it gets the job done.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with a smart dialing twist<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality of the Motorola RAZR i was top notch with a crisp and loud sound. Reception was also problem-free and we didn't suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would occasionally break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recent calls tab is straightforward in terms of functionality. The favorites tab is neat, as it allows you to dial the contacts with a single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the RAZR i. It scored a good all-round mark, meaning more often than not you'll hear it, save for the noisiest environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messaging is a standard ICS operation. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. You can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the RAZR i boils down to the standard Android Ice Cream Sandwich QWERTY keyboard. Texting takes a bit of getting used to in portrait mode, which is understandable given the small screen size. Still, it's enough to get the job done and things get a little better if you flip the phone to landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online and messages are displayed as usual, or you can switch to a Gmail-like conversation view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has also implemented email list gestures allowing you to mark an email as read with a simple swipe to the left. Additionally, you can assign custom actions to the swipe, in case the default one doesn't suit your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i is equipped with a stock Android ICS gallery. The Default view of the gallery is Albums - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, which are two per line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above each photo you have several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more option. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock video player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To be honest we were a bit that, coming with a new chipset, the Motorola RAZR i might lack support for some of the more popular video codecs. However, the smartphone managed to surprise us quite nicely, handling just about every video we threw at it played fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried DivX, XviD and MKV up to 1080p resolution and while some clips with higher bitrate weren't perfectly smooth, they were all able to run on the RAZR i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind though, that since there's no there's no dedicated video player app, you need to use the gallery for browsing and launching your videos. Once you start a video you are greeted by the stock Android video player interface, which is hardly the most functional around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut in the top right corner lets you share your video through Bluetooth, Email or upload it straight to a social network of your choice. There's also an option to stream it to a DLNA-enabled player near you and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock video player doesn't support subtitles, so you'll have to resort to a more feature-rich alternative in the Google Play Store (many of them are free). The good news is that the screen of the RAZR i is large enough and of high enough quality for enjoying video content, so once you get a proper player, you can tyrn the smartphone into great tool for watching movies on the go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR i comes with the latest Music app by Google. It has the same side-scrollable tabs like much of the other stuff in Ice Cream Sandwich. Naturally, it offers a link to the Google Play Music store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are used to organize your music library - there's Recent, Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features the track's album art with the track info and playback controls below it. You can tap it to reveal more options - like/unlike the song, a bar to scrub through the song and shuffle and repeat toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing a song with the screen locked shows a handy music widget on the lockscreen. It displays the name of the song as well as controls for pause, previous and next. The same controls are available in the notification drawer, too, save for the previous button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Motorla RAZR i failed to impress in our audio output quality test. The Intel-powered smartphone came seriously short of most of its mid-range peers, let alone the best we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When attached to an active external amplifier, the Motorola RAZR i produced decently loud output with excellent frequency response, dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio and virtually non-existent stereo crosstalk. However, it has absurdly high distortion levels, which ruin the overall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, attaching a pair of headphones actually helps improve the RAZR i performance. Volume levels did drop a bit, but then so did distortion levels. However, frequency response and stereo crosstalk also worsened slightly, so the overall performance is no better than average here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A poor 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i is equipped with an 8MP camera which takes photos with a maximum resolution of 3264x2448 pixels. It's accompanied by a single-LED flash to help out in low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is minimalist in design. On the right side of the viewfinder there's the virtual shutter key flanked by the front/back and photo/video toggles. On the left, there's the gallery shortcut that displays the thumbnail of the last photo taken (with a counter of remaining photos next to it) and the digital zoom slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has been thoughtful enough to put a physical shutter button at its ideal location on the right hand side of the device. For some strange reason, however, the button is not of the two-position type and you can't use it for focusing. It's really a baffling decision to by Moto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, there's a retractable row of shortcuts - those include effects, scenes, shooting mode, exposure adjustment and flash control (on, off, auto).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From Modes, you can choose single shot, multi-shot (4MP photos), panorama or self-timer. Scenes offer things like Sport, Macro, HDR or an Auto mode which decides what's best without your explicit input. There's an option to geotag photos - that info can be stripped automatically when sharing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a widescreen option that produces 16:9 photos. With it, both the viewfinder and the gallery images fit the screen aspect perfectly in full screen mode. However, the 16:9 aspect ratio means the photos turn out at roughly three quarters of the original resolution at about 6MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arguably the worst part about the Motorola RAZR i camera is the image quality, though. Photos come out extremely noisy and with very little detail. White balance is off too and the colors are a bit too cold and contrast is quite poor. Overall, this is certainly one of the worst (and probably the worst) 8MP camera we have seen.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i shoots 1080p videos at 30fps. The user interface looks identical to that of the still camera although some options have been changed. The Scenes option from the still camera has been replaced by Audio Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Stereo, Wind Reduction, Concert, Balanced and Front Facing audio scenes, which use the two microphones to adapt the audio to the specific situation. You still have the effects and exposure options and you can enable video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in .MP4 files with bitrate hovering at 15Mbps. The sound that goes along with the video is stereo (128Kbps bitrate, 44.1kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, videos captured with the Motorola RAZR i are not much better than the still photos. The clips are smooth, but they lack detail and have a distinct oil painting look. The colors are once again a bit too cold and while videos aren't as useless as still photos, they are still among the worst 1080p samples we have seen recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample captured with the Motorola RAZR i and uploaded to YouTube for easy viewing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i packs quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G with HSDPA speeds up to 21Mbps and HSUPA up to 5.76Mbps. Sadly, the RAZR i lacks LTE connectivity, but that's not too big a deal as those are still hard to come by in Europe. Also, including an LTE modem would have made the smartphone costlier and when talking mid-ranger every cent count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Bluetooth is only version 2.1 but comes with A2DP and EDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR i allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the devices back-to-back. You can share with other NFC devices as well, but functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great ICS browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i comes with the latest stock Android web browser as default, but since it runs on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, you can also install Chrome if you like. We like this approach far better than what Motorola did with the RAZR M - you are forced to use Chrome there no matter if you like it or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser's interface stays mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen available for displaying web content. You get the standard Menu dropdown on the right from where you can save for offline reading or request the desktop version of the website you are viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, Flash is seemingly a no-go on the Motorola RAZR i as we didn't even find a compatible app to try and side-load. Given that Adobe has abandoned the development of the mobile version of its Flash player, getting a version compatible with the Intel CPU inside the RAZR i seems pretty unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that there are few sites remaining, where Flash support is crucial, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top notch organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is an excellent app that has support for viewing several file types - Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF. It can also edit and create new .DOC, .XLS and .PPT files (both 2003 and 2007 versions are supported). You have plenty of formatting options, inserting images, Excel formulas and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app defaults to a desk clock mode that looks a lot like the lockscreen. The best part here is that you can tap to turn the light almost all the way down - with only the time staying on the display just bright enough to see it (it's much easier to see in the dark). This is a very power-efficient mode and you can actually use the phone as a desk clock without worrying about killing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present - you can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat pattern, ringtone and label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, Motorola hasn't included any file manager meaning you'll have to download a third-party app from the Play Store to browse the file system of your RAZR i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Smart Actions app, which comes preinstalled on most Motorola droids as of late. It allows you to create automatic actions triggered by different conditions you set. You can have the phone do various things (e.g. disable background sync, change screen brightness, display a notification to remind you of something, etc.). There are several sample actions that are useful in various situations but you can create your own from scratch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store is your one-stop place for apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, the Motorola RAZR i has access to almost all the latest apps in the Play Store and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a catch, though. As the Motorola RAZR i uses an X86 CPU, rather than an ARM one, it won't run any apps written using the Android NDK. Such apps will have to be rewritten to support the RAZR i Intel CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is just about every popular app out there is either compiled using the SDK, or at least has an RAZR i-friendly version already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store consists of several tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigation and location with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The RAZR i has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point, Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first gen of Intel-powered smartphones didn't exactly make a big splash but, given the low standing of their manufacturers and the limited availability, that's hardly a surprise. Back then, it was all about slapping a logo and selling it on your networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are pretty different with the Motorola RAZR i, which turned out to be a pretty stand-up droid. Motorola has done a great job of the hardware and used materials every flagship would be proud of. There's also the almost bezel-less design, which is the envy of the industry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is nicely designed, that extra homescreen reserved for settings a real usability boost. Motorola has kept close to stock Android, only changing what they believe can be improved, and the result is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great battery life should also boost Motorola RAZR i's market prospects. The smartphone's 2000 mAh battery lasts for ages and will easily make you forgive it not being user-replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the commitment to delivering timely updates. Normally, we wouldn't be too quick to believe such a promise, but with Google backing them, Motorola are worth the benefit of the doubt. In fact, we'd be hugely surprised if the RAZR i doesn't get to taste Jelly Bean before the end of the year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the Motorola RAZR i shapes up to be one of the most solid smartphones currently available in the midrange. However it's not an unbeatable offering and here are a few contenders that would gladly take on the challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first name that springs to mind is the HTC One S. The beautifully slim smartphone offers a choice of ceramic or anodized aluminum for its finish, depending on the color you pick, and an equally big screen of the same type and resolution as the RAZR i. It also comes with a couple of Krait cores and an Adreno 225 GPU under the hood, which have the Intel Medfield beat at the benchmarks. Best of all, the One S cost less than the Motorola RAZR i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The catch? There's no microSD card slot here and some regions got a Snapdragon S3 powered-version instead of the S4 one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once considered one of the best smartphones on the market, the Sony Xperia S is now standing firmly in midrange territory. Its dual-core chipset fails to match the Snapdragon S4 in terms of performance, but the 720p BRAVIA-powered screen easily puts the PenTile matrix of the RAZR i to shame. There's a 12 MP camera aboard the Xperia S too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again though, a card slot is omitted and the Sony Xperia S can hardly match the compact size of the RAZR i, but right now it costs noticeably less, so it's not an easy call between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Worst part is, the Motorola RAZR i's pricing at launch is far from competitive. In fact, it's dangerously close to some proper flagships. The HTC One X and the LG Optimus 4X HD are still about &#x20ac;40-&#x20ac;50 more expensive than the RAZR i, but even the die-hard Moto fans will tell you that the two have more than enough to justify such a difference. So if you aren't on a super tight budget, digging a bit deeper might be your best bet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One X &#x2022; LG Optimus 4X HD P880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Motorola RAZR i is a bit overpriced at this point, but that's usually the case with smartphones that have only just arrived to the market. It might make sense to just wait a few weeks for its price to settle down or to shop around for carrier contracts. The good thing about a smartphone like the RAZR i is that it will eventually get cheaper but not show it.</paragraph>
