			<paragraph>It?s no surprise that the BlackBerry Bold 9780 is the next logical evolutionary step, rather than a complete makeover that will propel it into the same league as the iPhone and Android. RIM has a loyal core of customers whose bond with the brand goes beyond the obvious business benefits. And devices like the Bold 9780 are certainly part of that bond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a geek?s perspective, a new generation of gadgets should emerge to a new generation of users. Radical, rebellious, with no sense of history and no respect for authorities. In the world of business, every new generation of gadgets has to make generations of users feel at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no moral dilemma for BlackBerry in this. They know trying to introduce new features and UI tweaks with each new generation involves substantial risk for some of the changes to backfire. But they haven?t given up on the Torch and the Storm, have they? Though it?s obviously much easier to stick to a tested recipe and only add stuff that?s been proved to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 upgrades the Bold 9700 by a 5 megapixel shooter and the new 6th version of the BlackBerry OS. It doesn?t sound much and when you consider that the 9700 was already updated to BlackBerrry OS 6 there is even less to choose between the two phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, will the new Bold 9780 reveal some nice surprises that are invisible to a casual scan of the spec sheet or will it be a mere footnote to the original Bold 9700? We hope to find out when we are done with the review. We start with the unboxing right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well packed, that's for sure<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Say what you will about the BlackBerry smartphones, but there is no denying that they come with some of the best retail packages in business. The Bold 9780 makes no exception ? it covers all the basics (a charger, headset and a microUSB cable) and throws in a few nice extra items on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a 2GB microSD card as well as a leather case. The high-quality case is a nice bonus.You can?t detach its belt clip, but it?s a nice case anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual paperwork is also in the box, but that earns the 9780 no extra points.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Bold 9780 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the 9700 before, the Bold 9780 is a very compact device. At 109 x 60 x 14 mm, it might not be the tiniest (and certainly not the slimmest) phone around but it?s impressively comfortable to hold in hand and easy to slip in a pocket too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think it?s easy for a QWERTY messenger bar to get away with the extra millimeters around the waistline. The 122 g of weight are quite reasonable too. You know ? we have a thing for heavy, well-built handsets but the BlackBerry Bold 9780 is by no means overacting. Anyway, if you prefer lighter handsets, the Curve 3G 9300 is perhaps your kind of BlackBerry phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 is not a crowd pleaser. But it certainly has the BlackBerry business charm that rates higher than the classic kind of good looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is solid but quite friendly ? with soft-touch rear surface and virtually no metal on the body. It is probably important for the Bold to set itself apart from steel messengers by Nokia. Whatever the reason though, the combination of leather and soft-touch plastic is great to handle too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty decent display and great keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>RIM is known for making solid displays without going to extremes. You won?t be getting 4 inches of Super AMOLED or Retina from the Canadians. But you can be certain that the Bold?s 480 x 360 pixel screen will have decent image quality and good performance outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the 2.44? unit is identical to the one found on the Bold 9700 with good enough contrast and relatively low reflectivity. The problem is that the rest of the world is moving forward, which is causing the BlackBerry HVGA+ units to fall down the ranks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However within its own QWERTY messenger candybar league, the Bold 9780 screen/keyboard combo is among the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And having mentioned the keyboard, we have to say that it?s where the BlackBerry pedigree counts the most. Despite having a lot less space to work with than the very first BlackBerry Bold 9000 unit, the keyboard of the 9780 is impressively comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are small but carefully sculpted for great tactility - only users with very large hands might have trouble adapting to it. The four-row layout seems the excellent balance between functionality and ergonomics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbers are sharing keys with some of the letters and you need to press the alt key to use them at times but that?s no biggie. And you?d be glad to know that whenever the context allows it, the switch is automatic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The rest of the controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Right between the Bold 9780 display and keyboard there are four keys around a centrally placed trackpad. The trackball days are long gone, but the responsive trackpad makes sure you won?t miss them. We tend to do things faster with a trackpad and with a minor tweak in the settings menu we had no troubles with accuracy either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other controls here are the Call, End, Menu and Back buttons. Large size and solid press, those are no trouble to use either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our trip around the BlackBerry Bold 9780 front panel at the top, where we find the traditional status LED and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left we come across the 3.5mm standard audio jack, the standard microUSB port and a convenience key ? a customizable shortcut. The key is preset to launch Voice-commands but you can change it to whatever function you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the BlackBerry Bold 9780 features the volume rocker and the camera key. The camera key is another convenience key. Being a two-step button, the role of a camera key suits it best but you can assign it with another function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the shooting with the Bold is confusing. On one hand, the camera sensor orientation demand that you hold the phone in portrait orientation to make landscape-oriented shots. On the other hand, the camera key is on the side, more suited to your thumb than your index finger. It just feels awkward. Using the trackpad as a shutter key is a lot more natural but then it doesn?t have the half press functionality to lock focus without shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most of its siblings, the BlackBerry Bold 9780 has the trademark invisible keys on top. One mutes the handset or pauses the currently running track, while the other handles the locks and unlocks the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty plain at the bottom, the microphone pinhole being the only element of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the Bold 9780 over brings us upon the 5 megapixel camera lens and its accompanying LED flash. The camera is the only hardware change the new Bold brings over the 9700 so its performance is quite important for the overall rating of the device. We?ll see how it lives up to our expectations later in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing of interest at the back is the loudspeaker grill. It?s centrally placed between the camera lens and the flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the rear cover lies the impressive sounding 1500 mAh Li-Po battery. It is quoted at up to 528 hours of stand-by or 6 hours of talk time. Normally we are used to seeing spectacular performances from BlackBerries with similar batteries, but this one was only good for just under than three full days of moderate use (about fifteen minutes of telephony and 45 minutes of using the other phone features a day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first we suspected a faulty unit as the Bold 9700 lasted about twice as much. User reviews all over the internet report similar performance so it might have something to do with the new OS and its power efficiency methods.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing of interest under the battery cover is the microSD card slot, which has no trouble handling 32GB memory cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s hardly breaking news that the BlackBerry Bold 9780 has excellent build quality. The rear cover fits tightly, no creaks or any other disturbing sounds when handling the phone. The surfaces are pleasant to touch and we have no reason to doubt the handset?s durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general ergonomics are pretty good too. The device is compact enough to allow single-handed operation and the keyboard is great for typing. You will need to put both hands into action to achieve the best possible speed though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the BlackBerry Bold 9700, the 9780 came to our office running the latest 6th version of the BlackBerry OS. We have only met the touch-implementation of this version so far, when reviewing the BlackBerry Torch 9800, so it will be interesting how it fares on a non-touch device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well the improvement here is less pronounced as the refreshed UI feels better suited for touch-operation, but BB OS 6 is still definitely a step in the right direction, the user-friendliness and UI looks have definitely been improved. But we still feel Symbian 3rd edition has the upper hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The differences on the homescreen boil down to the more colorful icons and the fact that the single icon tray has been replaced with several tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of those tabs holds all icons and is pretty much identical to the old app tray. However selecting its top and moving sideways with the trackpad reveals more tabs, holding your favorite (manually added) and most frequently used apps (auto generated).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also Media and Download sections now so there is more than one way of sorting your apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen is a virtual button too and allows quick toggling of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, as well as quick access to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A search button has been added below the status area, allowing you to quickly search the content of your Bold 9780. It even let?s you initiate quick searches in the BlackBerry App World, BlackBerry Portal, Slacker Radio or YouTube. It woks much like the universal search on iOS and Android and certainly gives the Bold 9780 an edge over competing non-touch devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the opposite end is the profile selection shortcut, while the area in between is reserved for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speed and responsiveness of the UI is pretty pleasing too and there are some animations added. However there are still some things that need improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you usually need a couple of clicks to open the app tray. You either press the Menu hardware key and then select app tray or you scroll to the tabs title and click it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next there are still some illogically placed icons in the main menu. For one, the camera is outside the media folder, while the video recorder is inside. The BlackBerry messenger is also not in the instant messaging section and so on. Of course, editing the menu arrangement as you see fit, is possible so you can easily solve that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we also wish we could put some shortcuts on that high-res homescreen (widget-like), like on the Nokia non-touch smartphones. A mode switch that would let you alternate between business and personal setup wouldn?t be too bad either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook got a facelift<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 phonebook got an overdue improvement in looks, which considering the already great functionality is all we could have wished for. Well actually it?s still not the nicest thing to look at, but at least it?s no longer the eye sore that it was previously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities to get displayed when checking out their profiles. You can easily search for a specific contact by typing in a part of its name so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Bold 9780 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact gives you the available fields organized in several sub-groups. You can also replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily so it?s all cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus there is SNS integration so the general experience is pretty pleasing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Smart dial is the telephony highlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 in-call performance was as good as we?ve come to expect from the Canadians. No voice drops or reception issues were experienced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What gives the Bold 9780 some extra points however is the Smart dial feature. Indeed that was our preferred way of locating contacts on the handset - you just press a few keys straight from the homescreen and a list of names that contain them appears on the screen. There?s no unpleasant delay or anything like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then select them with the trackpad and initiate a call - it doesn't get any simpler than that, does it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another worthy call feature is the Voice dialing, which gets activated by pressing the left convenience key by default. If you change that key functionality you can add the app to the favorites list and start it by scrolling to it and clicking over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 didn't fare too well in our traditional loudspeaker test. It achieved an average score, but only just. Still, the performance of most of its rivals isn't much better so it's not a big hit to the 9780 reputation .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about our test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is all fine, but email needs BIS subscription<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 handles has all kinds of messages, though its nicely organized apps. You get SMS, MMS and email support out of the box and there are also a few IM apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, much like with the other BlackBerry handsets, a BIS account is a must if you are to use email on the Bold 9780. And while we understand the advantages of the BlackBerry internet service, it would have been nice to give users some kind of choice. You know ? you can go for the security we offer or you can use whatever internet plan you have and live without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn?t forget that not every carrier worldwide is offering BIS, which reduces the Bold 9780 reach. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned itself good reputation over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized to 1024x768, 800x600 or 640x480 for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted from the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editors, which look identical for all types of messages, is pretty simple to use and packs a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. That one turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and the smart-dialing kicks in, giving you a list of contacts containing the typed letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that combined with the comfy keyboard makes the Bold 9780 pretty great at the task it was meant to perform ? texting. Some visual effects would also be welcomed, but getting the job done is what really matters here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player stays the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>But for the mild UI refresh the BlackBerry Bold 9780 music player hardly brings any news. It?s still pretty conservatively styled, but most of the functionality has been there since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still there?s quick searching of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Creating custom playlists is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, but unfortunately, there's no indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 didn't manage to impress us during our traditional audio quality test. The handset does decently when used with an active external equalizer, but still falls notably short of the best we have seen. And things get even worse when a pair of headphones is plugged it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied (i.e. the active external amplifier case) the Bold 9780 has decent signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk. The distortion levels are also kept well under control. However the frequency reponse is far from optimal with the extreme bass frequencies completely cut-off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones are connected, the Bold 9780 stereo crosstalk increases quite significantly, while the intermodulation distortion rises (though that still remains nothing to worry about). Frequency response worsens even further so you can see why we are not able to give the Bold 9780 full points in this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A solid video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The landscape screen is a good start, while the video player itself isn?t bad either. Its styling might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your videos works much like browsing your tracks in the music player. There?s again searching by typing a part of the desired file?s name so navigation is in most cases quick enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player normally works fullscreen with the virtual buttons only appearing upon a key press. There available controls include play/pause, stop and forwarding buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button reveals the other available features ? picking the video size (fullscreen, fit to screen and original size), setting a video thumbnail or connecting a Bluetooth handsfree. Volume is controlled through the dedicated buttons on the side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for customizable closed captions too, but the best part about the Bold 9780 video player is probably its DivX and XviD support. It didn?t manage to play all videos we threw at it, but most of them worked. There were also a few videos where we got the sound, but couldn?t get the video stream to run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, which is probably more than most BlackBerry-purchasing users will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A couple of cosmetic changes and a few new minor features is what sets the Bold 9780 gallery apart from the BlackBerry OS 5 version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid mode or viewed as a standard list. There?s searching by name here too, but we?re not the type that remembers the names of our cameta snaps, so we won?t count that as an extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can only be browsed in landscape mode or you can manually rotate them. Unfortunately the Bold 9780 has no built-in accelerometer to provide automatic rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can skip to the next photo without returning to the gallery ? you just flick your finger over the trackpad and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Checking an image?s properties, going into zoom mode as well as starting a slide show, are all a menu key click away. Setting one of your images as a homescreen wallpaper is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are zooming and panning. We would have preferred if the volume rocker could also be used for zooming, but the gallery is generally pretty good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 comes with a 5 megapixel camera with is the joint best achievement for a RIM smartphone. It probably packs the same sensor and LED flash as the Torch 9800, since the images those two produce are pretty similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the camera comes with the same old bad looking interface and relatively low number of customizable settings. What?s even worse is that the bar at the bottom covers a part of the frame, making proper framing a really hard task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is also pretty uncomfortable, considering that you do most of your shooting with the Bold 9780 in portrait mode. It wouldn?t have mattered if the trackpad also supported autofocusing, but as thing stand now you have to pick one or the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the trackpad worked in touch-to-focus, press-to-shoot mode, the Bold 9780 would have made for a more comfortable cameraphone. A workaround to this problem is setting the autofocus to continuous mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geo-tagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight from the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Bold 9780. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Bold 9780 is actually surprisingly nice considering the BlackBerry background of unimpressive snappers. It won't blow your mind but there is a good amount of resolved detail and the noise levels are tolerable. Contrast is fine too. What put us off though was the dull colors and the fact that most test samples we shot had a strong tint - either greenish or reddish. We've actually picked the best samples of the crop to show you below so you just have to trust us on this color unreliability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the BlackBerry Bold 9780 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    BlackBerry Bold 9780 in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording taking baby steps forward<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bold lineup is probably one of the worst performing in terms of video recording in the smartphone world. The Bold 9000 was a real disaster, while its 9700 successor didn?t do much better either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the third attempt takes video recording up to VGA resolution, which is indeed some progress. However the rest of the world has been enjoying 720p videos for a while now, and some are even getting 1080p, so we are hardly impressed with the 9780.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the video quality isn?t particularly impressive ? framerate often drops to 22-23 frames, making videos appear a bit choppy and there?s way too much compression applied. In perfect conditions you might get half-decent footage, but chances are most Bold 9780 owners won?t be keeping the camcorder in their favorites folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video sample from the Bold 9780 camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 is giving you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect from a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the 3G with HSDPA gives you the extra speed. The Wi-Fi is also present with a nice and easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Bluetooth with A2DP support rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 is also equipped with a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the mobile phone including your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even use the handset as a tethered modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you have the option to use your microSD memory card slot for file transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With LTE radios and HDMI ports starting to creep in on high-end smartphones we wouldn?t dare call the Bold 9780 connectivity package perfect, but it?s certainly good enough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The trackpad scores a point for the browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Bold 9780 is certainly one of the best we have seen among non-touch phones. Good software, quick-QWERTY input and precise trackpad navigation add up to a combo that is hard to match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panning is great thanks to the trackpad and the virtual mouse cursor. You just push it towards the border of the page et voila.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple tabs are supported and alternating them is pretty easy. Page rendering is near perfect, displaying almost every page like on a desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, pages are loaded to fit the display width with the virtual cursor taking the shape of a magnifier. You then just click on the part you would like to read and it gets zoomed in to fill the screen. A press on the back key and you are back to the fit-to-width view. Rinse and repeat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also text reflow so you can be sure that the column you are reading will always match the width of your screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the only bad part about the web browser of the BlackBerry Bold 9780 is the lack of proper Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handset provides probably the best user experience in browsing the web as far as non-touch handsets are concerned.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business objectives, the Bold 9780 has superb time-management capabilities. Its organizer includes a decent set of applications and although some of them are hardly lookers, their usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customized events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but sadly the device fails to provide them. Calendar entries can be forwarded and conference call information can be merged into the Calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also fully functional, with preinstalled applications able to open Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. Furthermore, document editing is also supported right out of the box, unlike some competing phones. Unfortunately, there is no PDF viewer preinstalled so potential users will have to get one themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Bold 9780 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the usual functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World kicks in<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is the RIM application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or Paypal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Managing your apps can be done through your computer or directly from the device itself. There are enough categories and a search box to make searching easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest titles. In general there's hardly much to complain about the BlackBerry App world interface, it provides pretty solid user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is that the number of applications is rather modest, at just over 4000, and only a small fraction of them are actually free (though some of the paid apps offer free trials). That?s nowhere near the iOS and Android standards, not to mention that even the fledgling WP7 has more apps than that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navi double<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Bold 9780 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. This means that voice-guided navigation is out of the question for the ones that buy it SIM free and then use it with their regular plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps provide basic map functionality plus voice-guided navigation. You can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map at the expense of a few clicks. The map data has also been updated, including more cities than ever. We can still think of at least several apps with more detailed maps, but let's not get too picky here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9780 is a pretty solid RIM device. Just like the Bold 9700 before it, the 9780 gives you excellent build quality, smooth performance and the corporate grade email and data security. If this is the kind of phone you are looking for, you might as well stop reading right here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, seriously, if the BlackBerry service is essential, the Bold is the quintessential phone to go with it. The Curves are just a little bit low profile, the Storm is too eccentric and the Pearls are the compact class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if the security levels of the Blackberry Enterprise server aren?t a must, there are probably better options for you. The 5 megapixel camera and the OS 6 are worthy upgrades but they still fail to give the Bold 9780 enough of an edge against the competition. BlackBerry phones have some advantages but bang-for-buck is just not one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 for one is a considerably cheaper alternative, providing similar typing prowess in a solid metal case that?s quite thin as well. Or you can save about half the cash and give the newer Nokia E5 a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E72 ? Nokia E5</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Milestone 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We could go on with this list really ? there?s no shortage of QWERTY-enabled phones these days and most of them will do no worse a job than the BlackBerry Bold 9780.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately for RIM, the smartphone business is still far from becoming a zero sum game. There are still enough new customers left to convert and RIM should be busy showing them that BlackBerry is worth giving a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will be up to the Storm and the Torch lines (or rather their sequels) to really put the brand on the map for the new generation of users. The Bold will have to juggle old commitments and new ventures. Five megapixel imaging, a knack for media and a refreshed interface may be a small step towards attracting new clients. But that?s as far as Blackberry would go changing the Bold series because otherwise they risk scaring and putting off the regulars.</paragraph>
