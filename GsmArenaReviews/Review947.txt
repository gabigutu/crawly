		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first Butterfly was somewhat of a wasted opportunity for HTC, the limited reach and high asking price preventing the 5" 1080p monster from becoming a global winner. Back then the company was merely trying to build up hype ahead of the launch of the HTC One and, had the Butterfly not been plagued by production issues, the strategy might have worked splendidly. Instead, the Taiwanese ended up losing sales to Sony, who delivered the Xperia Z ahead of the One, and Samsung who handled the Galaxy S4's supply and marketing better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we can't quite figure out is why HTC is sticking to the same plan with the Butterfly S. The second-gen five-incher by HTC comes with an even more capable chipset, the new UltraPixel camera and a massive 3200 mAh battery that should keep it on for quite a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That seems like a winning combo to us and, even with the One Max just around the corner, we don't see why HTC isn't planning to offer it on as many markets as possible. The target audiences of the Butterfly S and the One Max are quite different really, so it's unlikely that one will eat into the sales of the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we are not gathered here to guess whether HTC strategists know what they are doing. We are more interested in how the engineers have done with the Butterfly S. But before we dive in, here's the best and the worst about the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S is obviously a very hot prospect and it can easily outdo its far more popular One sibling in all but two aspects - premium styling and camera. The large "ultrapixels" are there, but as we found out when we reviewed the One mini optical image stabilization is an essential part of the equation. And while the glossy plastic of the Butterfly S certainly catches the eye, it's no match for the aluminum unibody of the One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you turn to productivity, however, the HTC Butterfly S is certainly the best smartphone HTC has produced so far. We already know how good the 5" 1080p screen is and with a Snapdragon 600 chipset under the hood, it's a package that can do wonders. Add a huge battery, which is closer in capacity to the HTC Flyer tablet than the HTC One, and the expandable storage, and you get a multimedia monster and business tool combo that's hard to match.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S retail package comes complete with the usual set of accessories. You get a pair of headphones that are slightly nicer than those offered by the mid-range smartphones out there alongside a wall-mount plug that you use together with the supplied USB cable to charge your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an HTC-branded SIM eject tool that lets you replace the microSIM card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Butterfly S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Growing a second front-facing speaker has only resulted in 1.5mm taller body for the HTC Butterfly S compared to the regular Butterfly (144.5 vs 143mm). However the much ampler battery has had much more pronounced effect on the smartphone's waistline - at 10.6mm the S version is notably thicker than the regular Butterfly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in thickness is much easier to spot when talking 5" smartphones and while the Butterfly S isn't unwieldy, it's not the most pocketable 5-incher either. The weight has been increased by full 20g as well - 160g vs 140g for the original Butterfly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were pretty fond of the matte polycarbonate unibody of the HTC Butterfly, but for some reason HTC decided to take a different approach with the design of its successor. Instead of the matte rubberized polycarbonate, our red unit used glossy plastic finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of aesthetics, the brighter glossy plastic seems to divide the opinions. It's certainly more eye-catching, but perhaps it's trying too hard and taking things too far. Everyone should pick their own side of the fence here as it's strictly a matter of personal taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately things are hardly so evenly matched as far as practicality is concerned. The glossy plastic picks up fingerprints and smudges at an amazing rate, meaning it requires quite a lot of cleaning. The new finish is also very slippery, which combined with the thicker and heavier phone could lead to an accidental drop or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the new finish seems to be rather poorly applied - the paint over the slot caps got chipped and we had only opened it a couple of times, while the back started picking up scratches quite quickly too. Hardly ideal for a smartphone that costs as much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we have the proximity and ambient light sensors to the right of the earpiece/loudspeaker and the 2.1MP 1080p front-facing camera on its left. Once again, HTC has put in a wide-angle front-facing camera, which lets you fit more into the frame when doing video chats (there's no native video call support, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find the three controls typical of HTC droids and the second front-facing speaker. The haptic-enabled capacitive touch Back, Home and Task switcher keys are well-spaced and very responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC Butterfly is completely bare, while the right side holds the volume rocker. Unfortunately, this is yet another Android flagship to come without a camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find a secondary microphone, the 3.5mm audio jack, and a small plastic flap under which reside the microSD card slot and the microSIM card slot. That flap is rather hard to operate, requiring you to push quite hard to get it open, which added to the easy-to-chip paint makes it one of the poorer design decisions we have seen lately. Worse still, the cap was fine on the original Butterfly so if HTC R&amp;D team was to leave it alone we wouldn't have any issues with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key was also placed here, which makes it pretty inconvenient to use. Instead of putting it on one of the sides of the Butterfly S, where it would have been easy to reach with your thumb or index finger, HTC has once again placed the most used hardware button on the place that is the hardest to reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like on the HTC One, the Butterfly S power key accommodates the Infrared port that is used for operating various appliances around your home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece and the microUSB port, which is used for data transfers, charging, and thanks to its MHL support, TV-out. With an MHL adapter you'll be able to output 1080p content to your HDTV directly from your phone, so purchasing one is probably worth it. Here the Butterfly S has a slight usability advantage over the first Butterfly as the very stiff and hard to open cap over the microUSB port has been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the HTC Butterfly features the 4MP camera F/2.0 lens and the LED flash right next to it. There's no Optical image stabilization this time, though, which is a pity considering that this was one of the best parts about the HTC One UltraPixel snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly is powered by a non-user-replaceable 3200 Li-Ion battery. HTC rates it to last for up 25h of talk time or 659h of stand-by if you stick to 3G networks - both of those are very respectable numbers but you wouldn't expect anything less from such an ample juice pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, the high ratings translate to excellent real-life endurance, with the Butterfly S scoring an impressive 81h rating in our dedicated battery test. This number suggests that you can go over three days on a single charge if you do an hour of talking, an hour of browsing and an hour of video playback per day. You can find the detailed breakdown of the Butterfly S battery performance in our blog.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Amazing 1080p display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We now come to the star of the show. The 5" 1080p screen is probably the main reason you are looking at the HTC Butterfly S and the third generation Super LCD won't let you down. The 441 ppi pixel density means you won't be able to discern individual pixels even if you press the screen against your nose, but that's by far not all the display has going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S LCD also offers great contrast and nicely saturated colors, to go with its extremely wide viewing angles. The viewing angles, together with the high resolution make everything appear as if painted on the screen - an effect we really appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see in the table below, the screen is decently bright as well. The blacks aren't as deep as those of the AMOLEDs out there, but pretty great in LCD terms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have a photo of the HTC Butterfly S display as seen by our digital microscope. The pixels are the same size as on the original Butterfly and that will hardly surprise anyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Butterfly S vs HTC Butterfly display matrices</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is not exactly perfect, but is good enough to not cause any usability issues.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Butterfly S screen is almost identical to that of its predecessor, but that's certainly not a bad thing - those are two of the best screens in business and have really done HTC proud.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense catches up to Android 4.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S runs Android 4.2.2 with Sense 5, which is right on par with the latest offerings from HTC, the One and One mini. The software includes the exclusive BlinkFeed and Zoe features. Here's a quick showcase of the HTC Butterfly S hardware and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense goes against the grain of most Android custom launchers and relies heavily on vertical scrolling, which can take some getting used to if you're coming from a different brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is the first place you'd encounter it - it's a stream of articles from around the web (HTC has partnered with some 10,000 providers) combined with account updates from SNS like Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is a part of the homescreen - the leftmost pane. When you tap on an item you get a preview with one big picture and a short blurb. Social networking items open the respective app instead. You can also search BlinkFeed and post updates to social networks straight from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that BlinkFeed needs a data connection to update, but you can set it to update over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving to the right of BlinkFeed you'll find the series of standard homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on the homescreen or a pinch gesture trigger edit mode. You can add and remove homescreen panes, rearrange existing ones and set one of them as Home (the one the Home buttons will always bring you to). The only limitation is that you can't remove or relocate the BlinkFeed, which is always the leftmost pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pull out widgets, app shortcuts and other shortcuts (e.g. one that links to a specific Dropbox folder, a Gmail label, a setting and so on). You switch between these via a dropdown menu, not really the standard Android way. If you prefer, you can pull out app shortcuts from the app drawer too - you have to drag a shortcut to the "Shortcut" area that shows up in the top left and then drop it somewhere on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is the second place where HTC went with vertical scrolling instead of the more popular paged interface. The drawer displays a 3 x 4 grip of shortcuts by default (which leaves a lot of padding around icons). You can use folders to group similar apps and make better use of the screen space. The other option is to switch to a 4 x 5 grid in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that to access the settings in the app drawer and BlinkFeed you have to swipe down. The Butterfly S doesn't have a Menu button, but you can assign the long press action of the Home button to cover for it. If you do that, you'll give up its default purpose of opening Google Now - which will be a swipe up gesture instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the app drawer is a big clock with date and weather info (a big icon and smaller text with more details). This same clock is at the top of the BlinkFeed screen, which makes the two feel very similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut dock at the bottom holds four shortcuts plus the app drawer button in the middle. These icons are always visible - in BlinkFeed, in the regular screens, in the app drawer, even on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pretty much stock android - it shows only notifications by default (below the top row, which is reserved for the time and date, plus two shortcuts). As of Android 4.2.2, Sense 5 also has toggles in the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty courtesy of Android 4.2.2 is the widget lockscreen. It's disabled by default, you have to toggle it on from the Personalize menu. Unlike the stock variety, you only get to pick a single widget, there are no multiple pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget lockscreen is much like the default one with a big clock and a weather icon, along with four quick shortcuts - you drag them up and release to launch the app they link to, just like the unlocking gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has fiddled with the app switcher - it is now launched by double tapping the Home key (unless you set that to be launching the in-app Menu, then it's a swipe up gesture) and it shows a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails of the recent apps. The upside is that you don't have to scroll like you do in the regular app switcher, the downside is that you can't scroll - you only get to see the last 9 apps and no more (for some that's quite enough). You can swipe up to close an app (which leaves an empty slot, an older app doesn't fill its place).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an interesting option in the phone's Security settings, borrowed from Windows Phone 8. It's called Kid mode and is actually an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they have access to. One annoying bit is that to enable Kid mode the first time around, you need to sign up via email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S also comes with a dedicated Car mode screen, which has been styled to look like the rest of the interface. There are only five big controls besides the clock and weather info. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense customizations also extend to the Settings menu - HTC has prettified it a bit with custom icons and added several new options (like Media output and Personalize).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're upgrading from another phone, you should give the Setup app a spin. It hooks up to your old phone over Bluetooth and pulls all the data it can, even things that Google doesn't sync (settings and such, not just the contacts). This also works for phones that can't sync with Google, like various feature phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S uses the Snapdragon 600 chipset which continues to grow in popularity, even though the Snadragon 800 is about to go mass market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Qualcomm APQ8064T SoC with Adreno 320 GPU is the same combo as the one found on the HTC One, except the quad-core Krait 300 CPU is clocked at 1.9GHz, compared to the 1.7GHz in the One. There's 2GB of RAM, same as on the HTC One, so overall we're expecting slightly higher, numbers here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1.9GHz clock speed of the Butterfly S's processor is amongst the highest around, and the results of the single-thread CPU test Benchmark Pi and the multi-thread Linpack and Geekbench 2 have the Galaxy S4 versions as its only real competitor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu factor in overall device performance instead of just the CPU, and the Butterfly S shines again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We run both of the GLBenchmark tests in offscreen mode, testing raw CPU power. Here the Buttefly S was behind the Galaxy S4 Octa, but just barely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Adreno 320 GPU on the Butterfly S supports OpenGL ES 3.0, which was recently added to Android (with 4.3) and that promised improved graphics. It's reasonable to expect even better graphics performance once Android 4.3 makes its way to this device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance of the HTC Butterfly S browser is close enough to that of the HTC One, but that extra bit of processing power helps push it past the other HTC flagship. In Vellamo we encountered our highest benchmark score to date, reflecting unparalleled browsing performance from the Butterfly S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the HTC Butterfly S is about as good as it gets in terms of processing power. The device is neck-and-neck with the Samsung Galaxy S4 versions in most tests, meaning that it has nothing to worry about in terms of both speed and future-proofing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As an integral part of Android Jelly Bean, Google Now is available on the HTC Butterfly S. In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will serve information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you a re-route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget which generates information for you based on what your interests are. You can put it on the lockscreen for at-a-glance info.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook offers a full array of features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 5 has seen some minor changes too. Instead of clickable tabs at the bottom of the screen you get side-scrollable tabs at the top, which is a more convenient solution (and along the lines of stock Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well by tapping the ellipsis button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook. These tabs can be hidden and rearranged too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the main fields but you can easily add more. If a contact is linked with a Facebook or other account you can see them either merged or choose to view either profile. In fact, the phone will automatically suggest to do that when it thinks two entries are for the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is Block contact - the Butterfly S will block all calls, texts and other messages from that contact. You can add any number too, which is great if you get spam messages from an automatic number. You can later check the call and message history from those contacts and take them out of the dog house if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony works like a charm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S did great in our signal test, providing great reception in environments where others dropped calls. The volume in the earpiece was extremely loud (we almost never used it at full volume) while clarity wasn't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC Butterfly S displays your recent calls with the usual tabs above, accessible via side-swipes. There's smart dialing on the Butterfly S - once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number. You can even switch to a QWERTY keyboard instead of the phone keypad. Another nice feature is the button that unveils all the contact info and lets you do just about anything - send an email, assign a custom ringtone and so on. It's a handy way to find the right contact and do more than just call them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem we have with the smart dial is that it only suggests one contact at a time - if you want another one (e.g. both Dexter and Dee Dee match "de" or "33"), you have to keep typing until you find the right one, you can't just pick out of a list of 3-4 matching contacts as on most other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is voice dialing, you hit the button, wait a couple of seconds for the Butterfly S to get ready and say "Call Dexter". This is a little too slow for our liking though (the phone says "Just one moment", pauses, "Say a command when you're ready" and then you can talk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S doesn't support video calling over the cellular network by default. The good news is there are a bunch of apps which could fill in the blank spot with video calling over Wi-Fi and 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus of BoomSound speakers is not absolute loudness but the quality of the sound. Somewhat surprisingly, the loudspeaker on the HTC Butterfly S did not perform as well as other recent HTC devices, like the One, or even the original Butterfly. It scored a Below Average mark, which means you'll have a hard time hearing it in loud environments or from inside a bag or pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Butterfly S are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Hangouts, which can connect you to Google's chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or half in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is pretty nice. Keys are well spaced but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them, which is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 5" diagonal offers ample space for comfortable typing. Some keys can be long pressed to get additional symbols, which speeds up typing in some cases as you don't have to keep going back to the symbols section of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa. You can also enable arrow keys, which show up below the portrait keyboard (but not the landscape one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Predictive input is available, the software will even try to guess the next word you're about to type. When the phone has learned from you, it can get pretty good at guessing. You can edit a personal dictionary of words and backup and restore it either to local storage or to an email account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has included the Trace keyboard, which acts like Swype. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to write. It works really well but language support is limited. Voice transcription is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the built-in HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client's threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs like many other Sense 5 apps. You can choose the Filters setting and show/hide the ones you want or rearrange the visible ones. You can choose from All, Favorites, Unread and Attached (hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC Butterfly S lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe is a wiz at photo editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Zoe is more advanced than any other gallery on a phone and it was made possible by the dedicated ImageChip 2. When you use the camera in Zoe mode, every time you press the shutter key, the phone captures up to 20 full res shots and a 3 second video (1 second before you press the shutter key and 2 seconds after). All that information is required for the advanced features of Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of those features is Events. Zoe can be used as a regular image gallery with photos sorted by folders, but Events can group photos by when and where they were taken. Each event has a 30 second highlight video, which is stitched together from those 3 second clips plus a slideshow, including some of the pics. You can remove clips and add new ones to the highlight video, add a video effect and also include a background music (the tracks are preset, though you can add new ones to the list).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The animation in the Gallery is seamless, which is more than we can say about it outside the HTC Butterfly S. If you save the pictures on your PC you're left with 20 shots for every Zoe animation created. The good news is HTC allows you to upload the sequences to their Zoeshare webpage and send the links to your friends. Images there are displayed like GIFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos and multiple full-res shots come into play when editing images as well. Since the phone has a video of the scene during which the photo was taken, it can find moving objects and put a red X on them so that you can tap and remove the ones you want, but keep the rest. The end result is a full-resolution 4MP image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe can also make sure everyone in the photo is smiling and their eyes are open - it detects all faces and circles them, then you can swipe to go through all available images of that face until you find the perfect one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another feature is called Sequence shot. It takes a shot of a moving object and it creates a cool "multiple exposure" effect where that object appears several times in the photo. It's perhaps easier to show the effect than explain it, here's a shot of a BMXer jumping over a ramp. You can tweak the effect by adding and removing clones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe's arsenal of effects doesn't end here - there are some vanity effects too. One such effect is Face contour, which allows you to easily slim someone's face. There's also Skin smoothing, an automatic lighting fix, Eye enhancer (which makes your subject's eyes open wider), Eye brightening, Red-eye removal and Anti-shine. The intensity of these effects is adjustable with a slider so you can fine tune it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just the Retouch section of the Photo Editor. There are also effects, frames and transformations available. Basically, Zoe is nearly as potent as Photoshop in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you are not limited to that site - you can share these albums on other social networks just as easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can find a map with your geotagged images in the Gallery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player has limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC Butterfly S has a pretty simple interface. There isn't even a dedicated app, you just pick a video from the gallery. Anyway, you get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to launch the camera and a small square with the current time and battery charge. Those automatically hide after a few seconds, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can use the Beats audio sound enhancement just like the music player, which is great for watching videos. The video player supports DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player used to have an option to play 60fps videos at 30fps for a slow-motion effect, but that has been removed (we checked the HTC One, the option is missing there too after the update to 4.2).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S failed pretty miserably when it came to codec support. It couldn't play most DivX videos (we even had an issue of an AVI video with MP3 audio playing without sound), XviDs refused to play, MOV files were out of the question and it also choked on some audio codecs (like AC3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos that played did so up to 1080p, including MKV files. With a display like that the HTC Butterfly S is some proper codec support away from becoming a powerful tool for watching video on the go. Luckily there are a few dozen video players in the Play Store to address this deficiency and some of them are even free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats audio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S comes with a custom music player, which is HTC Beats enabled, of course. It can organize your music library by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA, you're not limited to the music library you have in the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has some handy features out of the box. It can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only) and it can also search for lyrics. The lyrics can be displayed either in karaoke mode or just as text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board, you just have the option to toggle Beats audio on or off. That's not ideal, but at least the BoomSound stereo speakers on the front of the HTC Butterfly S are quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is HTC's track recognition service of choice and it has even been integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including the lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio alongside the TuneIn app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here however, nor is there a playback control card on the lockscreen. The SoundHound shortcut will find out the name of the currently playing song and can take you to a digital music store where you can buy it, lookup the song's lyrics, or even watch the video on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go with TuneIn Radio, which relies on your internet connection and can play just about every station on the planet that's gone broadband (most of them have). And the quality is arguably even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set stations as favorites, search local stations by country or genre, and the app will even list you results to specific artist, album or song searches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you can also set your alarm to wake you up with your favorite station. Keep in mind that you need an active connection for this and it does tend to take the life out of your battery fast in the morning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Splendid Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S is in line with that of the HTC One and the first HTC Butterfly. The last three high-end HTC phones combine high volume levels with excellently clean output to deliver the best output in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Buttefly S did perfectly in the active external amplifier part of the test, posting great scores all over the field. In addition it had volume levels higher than all non-Beats powered flagships making this a big victory for HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, there's virtually no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises so little that the difference is only detectable with lab equipment and the rest of the readings remain just as great. A flawless overall performance by the Butterfly S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>UltraPixel camera sans OIS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S uses the 4MP UltraPixel sensor, which is about the size of most smartphone camera sensors (1/3") but uses much bigger pixels (since the resolution is limited at 4MP). On the up side, bigger pixels have better performance in poor lighting conditions. There's also the fast F/2.0 lens that helps low-light shooting, but there's no optical image stabilization (OIS) like on the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which means that photos produced at its native aspect are perfect for viewing on the phone, on most tablets (which typically have 16:10 screens) and HDTVs. 4:3 photos would either get black bars or get cropped, which does help close the resolution gap somewhat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface itself is pretty simple - there are two shutter keys (one for stills and one for video), above them is the gallery shortcut and below is the effects button. On the left side of the screen you get flash mode selector and the Zoe toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we already covered what Zoe does after you've taken a shot, here's how the actual shooting goes. You enable Zoe (an indicator at the bottom of the screen confirms you're in Zoe mode) and tap the still shutter key. The key turns into a progress bar, counting down the three seconds during which the phone records video, reminding you to stay relatively still. This is accomplished thanks to the proprietary ImageChip 2, which is also used on the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S camera produces good images, but despite using big "UltraPixels" and shooting in broad daylight, the images had noticeable (at 100% zoom) noise. The low resolution also means that the smallest fine detail is lost. There are some oversharpening effects, and the noise levels are pretty high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even when viewed at the lower 1080p resolution, the photos look decent, but not as good as some of the larger megapixel sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the same samples taken with the HTC One. You'll notice a slight difference in white balance, but overall the images are very similar. The Butterfly S features a slightly narrower field of view, which could be due to either unit variances or a shorter focal length. The final difference we spotted is the pronounced softness towards the right edge of the Butterfly S shots - something that we don't see on the One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were curious just how much of a difference OIS makes, so we put the HTC Butterfly S against the big One to find out. We also tested the difference in video recording in the next chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first samples are taken in a dark room with the flash disabled. Both phones dropped the shutter speed to 1/5s and boosted the ISO to 800. The HTC One managed a better shot thanks to its OIS, which means that you should expect better low-light performance from the One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S has HDR support for both its still image and videos. In stills, HDR mode gives shadows a good boost, but it tends to wash out the highlights. Overall images captured in that mode are very poor on the Butterfly S and we suggest you keep away from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried out the panorama mode. The Butterfly S did the job well with almost no stitching artifacts (assuming there are no moving objects). Keep in mind that if the panorama includes dark shadows and bright highlights, they tend to end up under and over exposed, respectively.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S has the same camera as the big HTC One, sans the stabilization. You can see how the two stack up and how they compare to other cameras using our photo compare tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video camera with HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S can shoot videos at up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. It has an HDR option for the video, but note that the frame rate falls to 28fps, if you enable it and the field of view gets narrower in this mode. It also supports 720p @ 60fps high framerate video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features continuous autofocus and you have the option to lock the focus during video recording, if it hunts too much in dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a solid 21Mbps bitrate - among the highest we've seen. Sound is captured in stereo with 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. For the most part, framerates were solid at 30fps, but sometimes would dip to around 28fps depending on what you're shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, videos provide better quality than still images, with good color reproduction and not too much noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a FullHD video sample captured with the Butterfly S we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p sample (0:15s, 38.5MB) taken straight off the HTC Butterfly S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also watch a video shot with the HTC One a minute after the video above:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR videos capture more detail in the highlights, but don't do much for the shadows. The white balance is off (videos have a purple tint) and the colors are duller. Combined with the narrower FoV, we'd only enable HDR for videos as a last resort when shooting against the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p HDR sample as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 60 frames per second mode on the HTC Butterfly S but it reduces the maximum resolution to 720p. This doesn't sound too bad, but the actual output is pretty bad. There's very little detail and even though the clips are really smooth, we'd advise you to stay away from this mode. Oddly, we found that the 720p @ 60fps mode has the widest FoV, wider than even 1080p with HDR off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall image quality is nearly identical to the HTC One, although the lack of OIS means you can't get steady hand-held videos and that makes quite a lot of difference.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've added the HTC Butterfly S to our video quality comparison tool. Here it really managed to show what it's capable of, particularly when you look at the low-light video where it easily trashed its competitors (we use a tripod though).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S has the usual quad-band GSM, plus several versions (for different regions or carriers) of 3G HSPA+ and region-dependent 4G LTE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the Butterfly S to a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot can support up to 8 devices, you can use WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and enable only "allowed users" to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity with Android Beam is enabled too. We found it to work hassle-ree with webpages and heavier items like photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One comes with an MHL port, so if you plug a MHL dongle in, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection. The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV and with fullHD resolution capability, watching on an HDTV is a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock button on top of the Butterfly S doubles as an IR blaster, and can be used to control TVs and set top boxes (not to transfer data like in the old days).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the user end, the TV app lets you to control TV's and tuners from a wide variety of manufacturers. You can even get a TV guide in most areas just by entering your postal code.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser supports Flash and GIFs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S comes with the latest version of the Sensed-out Android web browser. Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking. Pages reflow to better fit the screen and you can set things like default zoom, search engine and URL suggestion providers and so on. From the Labs setting you can enable Quick controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button in their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces. There's also a popup blocker to stave off annoying popups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer, you can also request the desktop version of a site instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S comes with full Flash support in the browser (it's disabled by default). We tested a couple of games and videos and everything worked like a charm. Flash has almost been weeded out of the mobile web, but there are still a few stubborn sites around so it's good to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, while digging through the settings menu of the browser, we found that there's an explicit setting for GIF animations, which is disabled by default. The GIF format on Android has a spotty history, but the Butterfly S browser does support these animations, as long as you enable them first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Chrome browser also comes preinstalled on the HTC Butterfly S. Its interface is easier to navigate but it doesn't offer Flash support. On the up side, it can synchronize the tabs you have open in other Chrome browsers (on a computer, tablet, other phone, you name it).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full Office suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office documents are handled by the preloaded Polaris Office app. It supports Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc. and lets you view and edit files on the go. It's great to see a full Office suite when even some flagships (*cough*Galaxy S4*cough*) don't have one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar on the HTC Butterfly S has five different types of view: Month, Week, Day, Agenda and Invites. You can swipe between different months/weeks/days like you would through tabs in other Sense 5 apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Naturally, the Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invites view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app comes with World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch and a Timer. The World clock is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and freely zoom in on it. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are pretty self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tasks app is here as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support, compared to apps like Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Note app has been replaced by Scribble, which takes after the Note app found on certain Samsung phablets, and gives you a wide array of templates like to-do lists and calendar views. After selecting a template you can make various notes, add drawings, pictures and dictations. Sharing and printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it uses info from AccuWeather (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play for all your app needs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no HTC Hub in the Jelly Bean version of HTC's Android implementation. This means you can't get additional HTC wallpapers, HTC lockscreens, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps is better than ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly S has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition to the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looked at by itself, the HTC Butterfly is an extremely capable device. It gave the Galaxy S4 some serious competition in our benchmarks, and the very well-rounded Android 4.2.2 build with Sense 5 has some great software features you won't find from other manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem comes when you consider the Butterfly S next to what's currently on the table from HTC. With the ink barely dry on HTC One retail boxes, it feels like HTC are playing another trump card before the hand is even over. By releasing two flagships in such close succession, HTC could find itself with no response to a strong smartphone offering from a competitor come the holiday season.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But maybe the smartphone race, like many others, is really a game of inches where every little improvement counts. Maybe the extra 0.3" in screen estate, 200MHz in clock speed, 900 mAh in battery capacity, and expandable storage are what it takes to get ahead. But let's not forget that you're going to be paying a premium for those extras, and you'll be sacrificing superior build quality including a significantly more compact frame, as well as the optical image stabilization, which is the 4MP UltraPixel camera's saving grace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's the 5-inch 1080p display what counts, then the Butterfly S's predecessor offers that, alongside a slimmer design and a gentler price tag. You won't be getting the same performance, and will forego extras like the IR-blaster, ultrapixel camera, and larger battery, but the quad-core 1.5GHz Krait CPU can still hold its own, and the Android 4.2.2 build with Sense 5 has also been released for the Butterfly. The original Butterfly is also available as the DROID DNA for Verizon in the US.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Butterfly ? HTC DROID DNA</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if it's the cr?me de la cr?me we're talking about - and the Butterfly S certainly falls within that category - then it's impossible not to mention the Samsung Galaxy S4. While it falls short of the Butterfly S's huge battery capacity, the Galaxy S4 delivers the same 5-inch 1080p display with a lighter and thinner profile, and a more capable camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC it seems like the problem is never with making quality devices, but with when (and how, and where) to release them. The Butterfly S is a puzzling flagship offering hard on the heels of the previous one, and not unlike some other HTC handsets, hard to find in many markets. But it's impossible to predict how these things play out, and with the right marketing, the HTC Butterfly could be a hit - for those that can find it in their countries that is.</paragraph>
