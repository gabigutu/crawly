			<paragraph>Known as Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH or simply Tocco Ultra depending on the market, the latest touch phone by Samsung comes in the slider form factor. Beside the killer looks and slim profile of only 12.7mm, the specs sheet of the Samsung S8300 continues with a 2.8" capacitive OLED touchscreen, 8 megapixel camera and a GPS-receiver with Route 66 navigation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH a.k.a. Tocco Ultra at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been exactly one year since the first time one of the big-five phone manufacturers announced a fully touch-operated slider. The Samsung S8300 takes over from where the LG KF700 left off and attempts a huge leap forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the LG KF700 wasn't that popular, the Samsung S8300 seems ready to go that extra length. It is the key product for Samsung for the first half of this year and we are almost as curious as you are to see if it appeals to the phone-buying public.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH looks quite nice in the flesh and we have to admit that we are rather fond of the metallic frame around the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page for a detailed check of the device's ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8300 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH certainly isn't the slimmest among the touchscreen phones but the keypad and the slider design are enough to explain that. Standing at 110 x 51.5 x 12.7 mm it still feels rather pocketable, being only a tad longer (but somewhat slimmer) than most sliders. Its weight is also highly unlikely to trouble too many customers' pockets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already hinted we find the design of Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH quite attractive. The black metallic frame and the rest of the seemingly high quality plastic give the phone a sophisticated and exquisite look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you may have spotted on the previous page, there are some design differences between the S8300 press photos and the early pre-release sample we've got. As it seems, the final version may not have any orange highlights, and the keyboard will not be black but red. There may be some other differences as well, so please take our photos with a pinch of salt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout of the functional elements on the front panel is rather typical for a touchscreen operated handset. You get three buttons at the bottom - Call and End keys and a Back button that is used for going one step backwards throughout the menu. The back button is actually the rectangular one in the center, which resembles a D-pad to a great extent, but it actually isn't one - it's just a simple ley.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the keys on the front are large and comfortable enough to use and provide nice tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top you get the earpiece, the ambient light sensor and the videocall camera. There is also a proximity sensor that is used for locking the display when holding the handset next to your ear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rest of the S8300 UltraTOUCH front panel is taken up by the 2.8" OLED capacitive touchscreen display. Now this is our favorite part of the handset - OLED picture quality and capacitive touchscreen (no pressing necessary - you just have to touch the display) create a great user experience for each operation. Every picture looks incredibly vibrant on the OLED display since it has simply amazing contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not long ago we predicted that OLED displays would become more and more common as their prices got lower due to their far superior picture quality. We are now more than happy to see this prediction come true. This means the future of mobile phones promises even better picture quality and longer battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, we might not be entirely correct about that last thing, but there will be more juice left for the GPS and other power-hungry applications on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also claim that the screen of the S8300 UltraTOUCH is scratch, reflection and smudge resistant. Now we didn't have enough time to check that first item on the list but the rest seemed as more of marketing gimmicks than actual features. The legibility under direct sunlight wasn't by any means Omnia-bad but it wasn't spectacular either. And getting the display a fingerprint mess wasn't too rare of an event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the display, as the capacitive technology suggests, is excellent. The only problem it brings is that you are unable to use any other object for pressing the screen. The so-very-90's stylus is out of the question and so is operating the phone with gloves (fingernail, pen or any other artificial object). That means there's no option for handwriting recognition, however, that's a reasonable trade-off in our books.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Now that's an excellent keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open reveals the keypad. It is quite spacious with large enough keys for comfortable typing. Some additional bordering wouldn't have hurt the typing capabilities of the device but it is good enough as it stands now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH keypad has a nice, even backlighting which, combined with the great display, make for amazing looks in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Continuing our tour around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The only noteworthy element on the left side of Samsung S8300 is the volume rocker. It's large and has nice tactile feedback, making it quite comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 right side hosts the camera key, the display lock key and the microUSB slot. The latter is hidden under a small plastic lid to prevent dirt accumulating. We are glad that Samsung are using the standard issue microUSB ports on some of their latest phones, as this is definitely a step in the right direction. We'd be glad to see other manufacturers do the same thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is completely plain and so is the bottom, save for the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the S8300 UltraTOUCH hosts the 8 megapixel camera and its loyal companions - the LED flash and the self-portrait mirror. Those are of course only visible when the slider is open, which gives them some serious protection from scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover lays an 880 mAh battery. Not the most impressive capacity but with the relatively power-cheap OLED display it might just do the trick. Unfortunately with the pre-release status of our unit we are unable to provide any information about its real life endurance. Rest assured though, we will make up for that once we acquire a retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the S8300 UltraTOUCH is commendable. No creaks or other disturbing noises of any kind were heard throughout the time of our preview. The slider is also nicely done - as is usual for Samsung, it's smooth and stable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like what you've seen so far? Than waste no more time and join us on the next page to see our first impressions of the user interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Updated TouchWiz user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH has received a new and visually pumped-up version of the UI we saw on the previous generation of Samsung touch-operated phones. Lively, colorful and pleasantly thumbable - the latest reincarnation of the TouchWiz UI has inherited all the virtues of its predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice improvement is that the S8300 now has three different homescreens, which you can alternate by simply pressing the numeric icons at the top right corner. This is quite convenient as it allows you to fit many more widgets on your desktop and it still doesn't make too much of a mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New widgets have also been added to the UI, including some rather funny ones such as 'go on a diet' or 'quit smoking' widgets. Now, don't expect miracles from either of those - they are simply counters that can help you track your progress throughout the day. No automatic alarms when you get near the refrigerator or when you reach for your lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have missed it for some reason, the widgets are basically mini-applications that you can use to customize your home screen. Some of the widgets are more practical such as the calendar or the world clock, while others are just for fun such as the aforementioned 'quit smoking' and 'go on a diet' widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the widgets are stored on a bar on the left which you can reveal or hide by using the small arrow in the lower left corner. You can pick which ones to display by simply dragging them onto the display and placing them where you want. If you want to remove any of them, all you need to do is drag them back to the bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving the homescreen aside and the new menu icons graphics, the rest of the interface hasn't been greatly modified. Much like the Samsung Pixon you have a tab at the bottom of the display which holds four keys with varying functionality according to the currently selected menu. There are also some nice animations and transition effects throughout the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 4 x 3 grid of icons, while sub-menus appear as lists. You can use the keys on the keypad for selecting them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 also supports multitasking, which means that Java applications can be minimized to remain running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the fact that there is a hardware keypad, the user interface also offers an on-screen QWERTY one that you can use in case you don't feel like sliding the hardware one open. To gain access to the QWERTY keypad, you just have to rotate the screen where text input is available The accelerometer kicks in and auto rotates the screen presenting you with the QWERTY thumbboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung S8300 hasn't been greatly altered from the M8800 Pixon. Some additional visual effects have been added but that's as far as the changes go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player widget is cool, allowing quick access to the full version of the application by only a single tap. You can also start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer. A well deserved pat on the back also goes to the FM radio widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized including fast forward and rewind, just like the Pixon. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice finger-optimized galleries are available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once again in the Samsung S8300 we have a few different picture galleries. Accessed from different parts of the menu they are optimized for touch operation and are decently user-friendly. The first is an inherent part of the file manager and accessing it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. The sweeping is really responsive and fluid and we do like it more than we did on the Pixon. Then again, the capacitive screen might be the reason for this and not some software improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alternative to the picture gallery is PhotoBrowser. It has a dedicated icon in the main menu and is the quickest way to access you images. Sorting by face is again available, where you can name your pals and the phone automatically tags them when they appear in the photos. That's quite handy if you want to check out all the photos you have taken of a given person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The galleries also have slideshows and a nice accelerometer-based feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone on its side (plus, of course, you get automatic rotation of the photos by changing the device orientation).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this is something new with Samsung feature phones and something definitely worth checking out. The Pixon did have built-in GPS but its use was limited to geo-tagging and some Java applications, meaning no voice-guided navigation is available. The Samsung S8300 is an entirely different story as it comes with Samsung Mobile Navigator preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application itself is something we've seen before but its presence on a feature phone certainly is news. Using your phone for navigation is no longer only reserved for smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Mobile Navigator is in fact a regular Route66 product, so you can be quite sure that its functionality and map data is sufficient. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of extras, but the goodies come at extra cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this stage we are not really sure yet how will the pricing of the GPS navigation be formed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera takes on from where the Pixon left<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 makes use of the same camera module as the Samsung M8800 Pixon. However the engineers promise even further improvements in picture quality by enhancing the image-processing algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is capable of taking photos with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. The videos recorded by the S8300 can go up to VGA resolution at 30 fps, which still qualifies as pretty good even though the rumored Samsung i8910 should be able to record 720p HD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also has a number of nice built-in features including the Samsung proprietary wide dynamic range option, the anti-shake digital image stabilization, geotagging, face detection, smile shot as well as viewfinder gridlines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly one of the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately we are unable to provide you with camera samples as our unit had some issues related to its pre-release status. We will of course make up for that as soon as we acquire a more stable device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So far so good - the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH a.k.a. Tocco Ultra made a great first impression on us and left us eager for more. The capacitive touchscreen OLED display is simply amazing and certainly one of the key selling points of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera is also more than a welcome addition and even if its picture quality is on par with what M8800 Pixon offers, that will satisfy the majority of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colorful and user-friendly updated TouchWiz interface is yet another great part of the S8300. Even slightly unstable and buggy as it was in our unit, it was still a joy to use and makes the phone all the sweeter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that being said, the lack of Wi-Fi may turn down a lot of potential users, so positioning the device in the correct price group, will be one helluva challenge. We certainly hope, Samsung we'll do fine at it.</paragraph>
