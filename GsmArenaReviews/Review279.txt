			<paragraph>Market leaders Nokia were naturally among the key news makers at the Mobile World Congress (formerly known as 3GSM). The Finnish company revealed four new high-end devices today, including the dual slider Nokia N96, Nokia N78, Nokia 6210 Navigator and Nokia 6220 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 is a quad-band handset with dual-band HSDPA support for worldwide coverage. It runs on S60 3rd edition, FP2 and has a 2.8" QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) TFT display with 16M colors. Other features of this true powerhouse include GPS with A-GPS support and geo-tagging for photos, Wi-Fi, the stunning 16GB of onboard memory, plus a microSD slot. If that feature pack doesn't grab your attention, hardly anything will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 has a 5 megapixel autofocus camera with Carl Zeiss optics and powerful dual LED flash. It also records video in VGA resolution at 30 fps.The connectivity set sports Wi-Fi b/g with UPnP support, microUSB v2.0, DVB-H class C, a 3.5mm stereo headphone plug and Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP stereo audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 weighs 126g, and did feel a little bulky in our hands. The display however seemed on par with the Nokia N95 8GB (read: great).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia N78</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another very interesting handset joining the Nseries, Nokia N78 comes in the bar form factor. Both Nokia N96 and N78 have a few design elements in common, starting with the underlying resemblance to Nokia N81. This means that they will see little appreciation among the GSMArena team, as we aren't the greatest fans of that design, to say the least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 is a quad-band phone with dual-band HSDPA support. The novelties are geotagging and the integrated FM transmitter, allowing music to be played on any FM radio. Also to mention is the multimedia menu with Navi wheel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 also uses S60 3rd edition, FP2 and has a 2.4" QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) TFT display with 16M colors. Nokia N78 offers A-GPS support, Wi-Fi, 70MB on-board memory, expandable via microSD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 has a 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera with Carl Zeiss optics. It also records video in VGA resolution at 15fps but is still capable of playing VGA video clips at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options include Wi-Fi b/g with UPnP, microUSB v2.0, a 3.5mm stereo headphone plug and Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP stereo audio. Another especially interesting feature is the built-in FM transmitter that allows you to enjoy the music stored in your device on any FM radio.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6210 Navigator is expected to inherit the successful Nokia 6110 navigator. The newcomer is marked to be the company's first GPS-enabled mobile device (A-GPS also onboard) with an integrated compass for pedestrian guidance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator comes with Nokia Maps 2.0, announced today, and includes full voice and visual turn by turn guidance at no extra cost. Combined with an accelerometer, detecting changes in direction and orientation, the built-in compass makes it easy to follow the map when exploring your surrounds on foot. When you turn the device, the map automatically maintains its orientation. It is a cool to use feature by any means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting aside the pivotal feature, the GPS, Nokia 6210 Navigator has a decent set of other features to offer: 2.4" TFT QVGA display with up to 16M colors, quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support with dual-band HSDPA. The phone runs on the S60 3rd edition OS. The built-in 120MB of storage space can be further expanded via microSD cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new navigator has a 3.2megapixel camera with LED flash. Among the additional features are the music player, visual radio and stereo FM radio. Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP and AVRCP support, along with the 2.5mm AV connector and microUSB slot complete the connectivity options.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia 6220 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last announcement today was the Nokia 6220 classic, a feature-rich handset to combine a 5 megapixel camera, built-in GPS and HSDPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6220 classic sports xenon flash and Carl Zeiss optics and a 16M-color 2.2" TFT QVGA display. The camera is capable of recording MPEG-4 video clips at VGA resolution and 30 fps. Geotagging support is available, while the Nokia Maps 2.0 application is preloaded. We managed to snap a few shots with its camera and we were quite pleased with the results, as you will see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6220 classic also offers a MP3 player and FM radio with RDS. The built-in memory of 120MB can be further expanded via microSD cards (up to 8GB supported).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the quad-band GSM network support, Nokia 6220 classic can also work on two HSDPA bands. The handset features a microUSB slot, 2.5 mm AV connector and stereo Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found Nokia 6220 classic extremely pleasant to work with. It has enough processing power, although exact CPU specs have not been officially announced just yet. We'll make sure we update you, as soon as we get them.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>S60 Feature Pack 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the four new handsets, Nokia introduced significant software improvements to its mobile range portfolio. All the new devices come with Symbian v9.3 S60 UI 3rd edition with Feature Pack 2 pre-bundled. The Feature Pack 2 includes both visual and performance upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to notice was the new Active stand-by screen, which now allows quick access to a lot more features. The stand-by is now organized in tabs and the D-pad is used for browsing through them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery application is another innovation of the new feature pack - it has new looks and an improved browsing system. The speed of browsing through your pictures increases if you hold the direction buttons on the D-pad longer. This allows quick skipping through tons of photos in a blink of an eye. Besides, the gallery has a much more conveniently placed shortcut for accessing the picture details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60 UI Feature Pack 2 also enables tagging of your pictures. In addition to geo-tagging, which is automatically handled by the built-in GPS (if the handset has one), you can also tag any keyword you can think of to your photos. These should help you find your pictures easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Navi wheel functionality is also improved to show much more of its potential. Remember how we complained about its functionality in Nokia N81 8GB being limited to certain parts of the interface only? Well, it seems Nokia also felt the same way about it and have now enabled the wheel to work in any menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new task manager also earns our praise as it looks much better and is now appearing on every pop-up menu. It is actually placed on top of every list, which may seem irritating in some cases. In addition, you can still use the well-known shortcut by holding the menu key for a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the S60 UI Feature Pack 2 brings some graphic improvements as well. Animations are now available when going through the menus or rotating the screen. Fading in and out of the camera viewfinder looks very cool and really adds up to the eye-catching camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S60 touch UI</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other achievement of Nokia's software department that they showcased at this year's Mobile World Congress is the new S60 touch user interface. For now it's only emulated since an actual device working on it is far from being released.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this stage, we only know for certain that future S60 Touch devices will have displays of a 360 x 640 pixel resolution. We also noticed that the 16:9 aspect ratio seems to be getting more and more popular recently - the S60 Touch UI is a fine example. Here is our video, which will give you an idea about how the S60 touch user interface looks and feels.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Along with the new additions to the Nokia portfolio, we also had the chance to play around with some previously announced handsets we were seeing for the first time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Softwarewise, the Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte is an exact copy of the 8800 Arte. However, in terms of hardware, there are a few differences. The Sapphire Arte keypad cover and battery cover have a brown leather finish. The accelerometer sensor is also much more sensitive, which improves the magic clock application performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us remind you that this application allows the user to see the clock on the phone's display by simply tapping on the surface below the display twice. It also works by shaking the phone but the Sapphire Arte is much more responsive than the original Arte in both cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final difference between Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte and the 8800 Arte is the Sapphire gem stone on the D-pad of the former. It looks quite well in reality but we are of two minds about whether it's worth the huge difference in price between the two handsets. You can check out our Nokia 8800 Arte review for more information about the high-end Nokia devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3120 classic was also showcased in Barcelona. It's a likable mid-tier phone with a reasonable price tag and a decent amount of features. In reality, it is nice looking and easy to use and that seems a good enough premise for market success.</paragraph>
