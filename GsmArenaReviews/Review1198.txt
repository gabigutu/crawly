			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst is the first budget oriented Android smartphone to hit AT&amp;T's newly launched LTE network. Interestingly enough however, the fifty-dollar handset shares the exact same CPU and chipset as the top dogs in the carrier's 4G lineup. Throw a 4" Super AMOLED screen, a gig of RAM, as well as 16GB of built-in memory to the device's specs, and one really begins to wonder where the budget moniker came from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pantech has never been a major player on the smartphone market in the United States. The subject of today's feature is probably the first attempt of the company, worthy of attention, and for a good reason. You can easily find out why, by taking a look at the key features of the handset below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see in the list above, as far as hardware goes, the Pantech Burst is practically neck to neck with the best Android smartphones on AT&amp;T's LTE network. The smartphone's CPU and chipset are still one of the speediest around. Its Super AMOLED screen on the other hand, is hardly a budget phone fixture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So is the Pantech's entry into the major leagues a proper powerhouse, or is its low price tag an indication for compromises to be made? Read on to find out. As always, we'll kick things off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Pantech Burst for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The retail package is worthy of the price tag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the compact box of the Pantech Burst, you will find nothing but a microUSB cable and a funky looking charger - hardly a surprise given the price tag of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is much easier to excuse the Pantech Burst for lacking a pair of headphones in its retail box. After all, it costs a mere $50. We must point out however, that most AT&amp;T retail packages we've run into lately, look this way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's face it - the Pantech Burst is hardly a memorable achievement in terms of design. This is particularly evident at the device's front - all you are going to see there is an AT&amp;T logo. There is absolutely no sense of brand identity incorporated into the device - a clear indication that Pantech are relatively new to the Android party in the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is available in two color schemes - black and red. This should help it appeal to a broad range of potential consumers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is solid for a device, which costs only $50. High quality plastic is the predominant material used in the making of the Pantech Burst. Gorilla Glass is not present on the device, but we can hardly expect it at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst is an extremely pocket friendly smartphone. Its measures are 126.5 x 62.5 x 11.4 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 122 grams. The pocketability can be attributed mostly to the small-ish 4" screen of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the screen, in the case of the Pantech Burst it is a 4" Super AMOLED unit with WVGA resolution and a pixel density of 233ppi. Contrast and viewing angles are great, as is the case with all Super AMOLEDs. Our only grievance here is the PenTile matrix of the handset's display. Because of its presence, you can see the actual pixels on the device's display, despite its respectable density. We had to remind ourselves about the price of the device once again here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, you will find the earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the front-facing camera. Below it are four touch-sensitive buttons - just like in any other Android smartphone on sale in the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker can be found on the left side of the Pantech Burst. The microUSB port, which is also used for charging is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the power/lock key are located on top of the device. The mouthpiece is on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the smartphone is where the 5MP camera and LED flash reside. The speaker and a secondary microphone keep them company. A relatively large Pantech logo and a latch for removing the battery cover complete the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover is where the microSIM and microSD card slots are found. Both cards are not hot swappable - you need to remove the battery before you can take any of those out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1650mAh battery is not among the strongest features of the Pantech Burst. The smartphone managed a score of 31 in our battery test. This means that you will need to recharge your phone every 31 hours if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that our web browsing test is conducted over a Wi-Fi connection. Expect the LTE network to be even more taxing on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out all about the handset's battery test results here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst is an extremely easy smartphone to handle. Its 4" display allows the device to be operated even with one hand, without compromising too much on the screen real estate - a rare occurrence in the Android realm lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst is far from being perfect as far as design and build quality are concerned, but this is excusable given the low price tag of the device. It is what's inside the smartphone that matters most here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is now time for a closer look at the smartphone's performance and software. Don't be surprised if you come out rather impressed afterwards.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread the Pantech way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst comes with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread out of the box. We were told that ICS update is planned, but no timeline was provided for it. Google's OS is dressed in a really nice and functional UI from Pantech. Check it out in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most impressive tweaks, which Pantech brought to Android in its Burst, is the lock screen. The latter packs the impressive six shortcuts, which can take you straight to the homescreen, the native email app, the music player, the text messages, web browser, as well as the phone dialer. The only notable omission here is the camera, we think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are seven homescreen panels at your disposal. You can arrange them any way you want but, unfortunately, you cannot delete any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding and removing widgets is business as usual. Here, we must point out that Pantech have added their own in a separate section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android notification area has been seriously touched as well. It has an additional, slide-out section, which adds additional settings and applications management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application launcher can be heavily customized as well. You can view the apps as a list or a grid. The background can be changed as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case all the above customizations don't cut it for you, there are also themes at your disposal. They do very much resemble the ones offered by another Korean maker. They include Work, Play, etc. You can also save your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there is a task manager at your disposal. It can be accessed by long pressing the home button. The available RAM memory however, is strangely shown only as a graph, without showing you the actual amount. With a gig on board though, you're not going to have to check it often.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive benchmarks for a budget smartphone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst sports a Snapdragon S3 chipset with two Scorpion cores, clocked at 1.5GHz, to go with an Adreno 220 GPU. The same internals can be found in some serious heavy hitters such as members of the Samsung Galaxy S II range, the Samsung Galaxy Note, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the cut-price droid posted some seriously impressive benchmark scores. Check them out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can probably guess, the smartphone handled every task we threw at it with ease. Its internals also make it nicely future proof as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A hassle free phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst phonebook offers the typical for all Android smartphones functionality. There is practically no limit to the amount of detail you can add to a contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with Yellow Pages on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The telephony of the Pantech Burst does without smart dialing. To make up for the loss though, you get Yellow Pages integration built in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call quality of the Pantech Burst was superb. The device actually held its signal better than some of its upscale siblings in the AT&amp;T lineup, when used in the same room.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has all bases covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst's messaging department, unsurprisingly, boasts a rich functionality. Messages can be arranged by a date or contact name. Adding multimedia to a message automatically turns it into MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of text entry, you have two options out of the box in the Pantech Burst - the standard Gingerbread keyboard, as well as Swype. More options are readily available at the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Burst uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you - aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there's nothing new really. And don't you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two-finger tilt zoom works much like the name suggests. You touch the screen with two fingers and as soon as you start tilting it, it will zoom in or out according to the tilting motion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music player of the Pantech Burst has all the functionality you will ever need. You have equalizer presets at your disposal, as well as the option to create your own. 3D sound effects are also on tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When playing, you can access the player straight from your homescreen without unlocking it. Naturally, it is also available in the notification area once you do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A simple, but capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst handled all major video formats without breaking a sweat. Large files were also a go, due to the beefy CPU and chipset, while the Super AMOLED screen did bode well for the battery performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A better than average 5MP shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is simple and intuitive. There are two shortcut bars on both sides of the viewfinder, which allow you to access all the camera options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still photos, taken with the Pantech Burst came out quite decent, considering the phone's price category. Detail is nice, and so are the colors. Noise could have been better though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camcorder could have done better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the one found in the still camera. The same shortcut bars can be found on both sides of the viewfinder, so no surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with the Pantech Burst could have been much better. Despite the decent 14104kbps bitrate, the videos come out pretty choppy at only about 19fps.The amount of resolved detail isn't particularly impressive either and while the colors are nice, you should probably stay clear of the Burst if you like to record video on your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched 720p video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity with more options than you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can probably guess, the connectivity is fully covered in the Pantech Burst. The feature, which you need to care about most here, is the LTE connectivity. We enjoyed consistently blazing speeds in the New York City area with the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good web browser with the benchmark scores to prove it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of the Pantech Burst has been given an UI treatment, but its functionality has not suffered in the process. Playing 720p videos was also a go, thanks to the speedy CPU and chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst scored very high in the Vellamo browser benchmark. The device is on par with the best offerings on the market today on this instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing you must keep in mind, when using the browser is the battery life of the Pantech Burst. The combination of predominantly white backgrounds and AT&amp;T's LTE network did not fare well for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer without a document editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Burst, like all Android smartphones, has a capable organizer right out of the box. Unfortunately however, you will have to make do only with a document viewer only. In case you need a full blown editor, prepare to spend some cash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app now uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. It will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version also supports indoor navigation for popular shopping destinations and airports across America. It is still in Beta though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store replaces the Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google recently changed the name of the Android Market in the United States to Google Play Store. The idea behind the move was to put all content, available for your Android device under the same roof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite frankly, the new name and launch icon aside, you will be hard pressed to find any major differences between the old and new setup. See for yourself below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is plenty to like in the Pantech Burst. The smartphone packs one of the most powerful CPU and chipset combinations on the market, a Super AMOLED screen, and LTE connectivity, all wrapped into an unpretentious looking package. The Pantech twist on Android Gingerbread is a surprisingly nice touch as well. Throw in a $49.99 price tag, and the handset shapes up as a seriously compelling entry package into the LTE world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the phone is far from perfect. Its unpretentious look is actually rather dull, while the Super AMOLED screen falls a tad short of the expectations, because of its PenTile matrix. The camera and battery performances are also rather questionable. In short, those are the negatives of the low price, which the Pantech Burst sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We looked really hard, but could not find another dual-core, LTE phone for the price of the Pantech Burst. For $99.99 however, you can hop on the premium Android wagon, represented by the LG Nitro HD and HTC Vivid. Both devices are also running on AT&amp;T's LTE network. The HTC offering will entice you with an ICS update, which is already available, to go with more upscale hardware. The LG Nitro HD, as its name suggests, has arguably one of the best screens found on a mobile device at the moment. If you have spare change, both handsets are worth a close look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Nitro HD &#x2022; HTC Vivid</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key to the Pantech Burst's success on the market is the timeframe of the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update. If it happens sooner, rather than later, the event will add a massive dash of appeal to an already attractive device.</paragraph>
