			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are reading this, chances are mobile phones are something between a mild addiction and a passion for you. It?s that time of year again and you might already be eyeing a phone to gift your loved one or ? there we go ? yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This article is kindly sponsored by Gillette and their "Thanks Dad" campaign. But once you get your Dad a nice new Gillette Fusion ProGlide, why not pat yourself on the back for all the hard work this year and get yourself a new mobile phone. Who said presents are only meant for giving?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It should be easier than ever to find a nice phone. Phones are getting better, smarter and prettier as we speak. But what looks like amazing diversity is actually making it complicated. The race for more speed, more power, more screen estate and pixels has been blurring the differences between phones, platforms and styles. Fortunately, there are still phones that stand out. Phones that are better than the rest at one thing or another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve listed our best picks in various categories, but those are simply to be used as a guide. The evolution of mobile phones over the past couple of years has been moving towards all-in-one devices, and away from strong specialists. Still, we hope our selection covers a wide enough range of shapes, sizes, features, user profiles and budgets. There?re phones for the geeks and phones for the not guilty. Phones for boys and phones for their dads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a moment, we were torn between being the usual geeks and giving in to the Christmas spirit. You know, playing nice cute and sugar-coated. No winners and no losers, just sweet cinnamon smell and jingle all the way. But did you think we?d miss an opportunity to call a flop a flop? It?s that time of year though and even our Lumps of Coal should be taken with a pinch of salt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there?re no losers here. Even the runners-up in each category are all phones that we?d gladly recommend. And mind you, some of our protagonists are just ordinary gadgets doing extraordinary things. Others are the real deal ? celebrities and heavyweights in business and entertainment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a related note, there is no ultimate phone category either. No one phone to rule them all, no direct line to Santa. But if you think the best phone is always the next one, this write-up might be just the thing for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And because those holiday gifts usually take some time to ship so we?d better get going. Or you might not manage to order in time. We start with a low ball ? the best in the classic form factor awaits after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Candybar classics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It seems we have no choice but start in Finland. The first and most convenient place for Santa to stop and pick up some gifts on the way. Say what you will about our itinerary but Nokia still knows how to make great phones. And compact handsets in the classic candybar form factor are what the Finns are real good at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s no surprise that our absolute favorite in this category is the Nokia X3-02. Combining ultra-sleek looks with great connectivity and a pinch of touch, it?s one of the devices to impress us the most over the past few months. Not to mention how marvelously slim it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia X3-02</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course it?s not nearly as functional as a high-end smartphone, but it never tried to be. The X3-02 is for the calling and texting kind. And last time we checked those were still the majority of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it?s 2010 and touchscreen is essential if you want to be taken seriously. The Nokia X3-02 is the right device for someone who is still not ready for a full-time commitment to touchscreen but willing to find out what the rage is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to point one thing we would change about the Nokia X3-02 it would be the fixed focus camera. But still the X3-02 will be our first choice for a classic candybar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The runner-up here is another slim Finn ? the slick and solid C5, and a smartphone at that. It does better on the functionality end as the Symbian OS is as mature as it gets and there are a few thousand apps available for it (not to mention that Ovi Maps free lifetime voice-guided navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the Nokia C5 smartphone user interface is a bit more complicated than the X3-02, which is not a virtue in this class. However it?s build quality that eventually made the C5 second in this race ? the metal back panel, nicely looking as it might be is a bit too prone to scratches. You will need to protect it carefully if you plan on sticking with the C5 for a while.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY on a budget<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Need to make best use of that unlimited texting plan? Or are you constantly sending emails on the go? A QWERTY handset is in order then and if you don?t feel like breaking the bank ? this is the place to look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Simplicity and pricing are key here (there?s another chapter dedicated to premium QWERTY messengers) and the logical choice can be no other than Nokia C3 ? the socialist. The entry level phone takes social networking seriously and has a comfortable keyboard to let you breeze through texts. It?s good at the basics and goes for peanuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s hardly any extra functionality that the C3 can give you but you just cannot match its bang for the buck ratio if you are all about the texting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively you can go for the extra muscle offered by the C6, which is still reasonably easy on the wallet. Packing a larger slide-out keyboard it also offers the touch-driven experience, even if S60 5th edition might not be exactly the pinnacle of its evolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still adding a hardware keyboard fixes one of the major Symbian flaws (text input), while downloading an alternative browser from the Ovi store will fix the other (poor stock web browser). Plus it?s mostly about texting here and S60 has that pretty decently covered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bargain basement smartphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s about the pricing with those and the quest of trying to get the most functionality for the price of a dinner for two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5230 seems like the most obvious choice here, giving you 3G, free lifetime navigation and an nHD touchscreen for about 100 euro. If contract-requiring subsidies aren?t your game and you are trying to keep your Christmas spending to a healthy minimum, be sure to check this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two ultra-cheap smartphones that deserve your attention are the Eclair-powered Sony Ericsson X8 (capacitive HVGA screen) and LG GT540 Optimus (resistive unit). They do cost about 50 more than the 5230, which cost them the title here but are still viable options as they offer more extra features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 ? LG GT540 Optimus</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY smartphone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Notice the change in scenery? See the wildlife growing in size? We are now deep into predator territory. A smart QWERTY messenger is in fact for some people the best smartphone on the market overall. You know ? if a few millimeters of extra thickness don?t bother you (and they are getting fewer these days), getting a device that offer the full touch experience and speedy text input is really an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device that managed to grab our hearts here is the HTC Desire Z (not that we had much choice in the firs place). Packing the latest version of what is currently the second-soon-to-become-first most popular smartphone platform a unique opening mechanism and the new generation Qualcomm CPU the Desire Z is a real beast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that?s only the start of its list of assets ? perfect connectivity, loads of RAM and app storage plus the company?s proprietary Sense UI are not to be neglected either. And that 3-second boot time is impressive, even if not needed by everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general the Desire Z has very few major weaknesses and none of them are actually deal-breakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit to taking a bit of a gamble with our second recommendation here as we haven?t completed our review just yet. Still Motorola MILESTONE 2 looks very much like the device to please QWERTY addicts with a taste of smartphone muscle (again, the choice of high-end QWERTY smartphones is quite limited this holiday season).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first MILESTONE was already a pretty great device and adding a 1GHz CPU, more internal storage and RAM made it all the better. The removal of the D-pad in favor of the four arrow keys made more space for the real keys and the high-res display makes browsing all the more enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s only the tweakers that would do better to stay off the MILESTONE 2 ? with Motorola locking its bootloader, it?s bound to give you more headaches when you start tinkering with it system files. Mind you, Desire Z also had issues with third-party ROMs but the hacking community has overcame them already.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming on the go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming is the new megapixel race as far as mobile phones are concerned. We?ve reached a point where a platform?s gaming capabilities are one of the things people care about the most. Cool game titles and variety in the gaming part of the application repository are now valid reasons for picking one handset over another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device to benefit the most from this new trend is the iOS-powered iPhone 4. The App Store offers the most high-quality titles and while the Android is doing all it can to catch up, they will need more time. Meanwhile the Apple faithful are enjoying the fine graphics of Rage HD on their Retina screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no definite runner-up in this category as every WVGA Android with Froyo with 1GHz CPU would be a suitable choice for playing the best that the Android market can offer, and picking one of them will not be quite fair.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Top-notch audio quality, loud output and ample storage ? those are the three vital components that make a great portable music player. There is also a fourth one - good battery life, which could earn some bonus points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, there is a device that delivers an excellent performance in all of the above. Some of you probably guessed that it?s again the latest iPhone we are talking about. Indeed the iPhone 4 is the best performer even among its own very musically-gifted family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple?s iPod experience counts big time here as the handset has nice and simple interface, flawless output and can last for ages on a single charge. The iTunes-only syncing is the only thing raining on iPhone 4?s parade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess the now elderly iPhone 3Gs will do just fine as a music player, although it?s only available in the 8GB variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you would like a simple copy/paste upload you can go for Nokia?s latest Symbian^3 handset, the C6-01. It?s a bit quieter than the iPhone 4 but that?s about all the compromise you need to make. And you?d be saving yourself quite a lot of money if you go this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honestly, with microSD storage getting cheaper by the day, there are a lot of handset that would do great at playing your music collection on the go. Some higher-end handsets may even throw a few extras such as an FM transmitter, however almost any phone out there will do. Don?t forget to check our audio quality tests in the reviews before you buy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And while music playback requirements have stayed about the same over the past few years, video playback requirements have risen dramatically in just a few months. This time last year there was only a couple of devices capable of doing 720p videos (and only if those had relatively low bitrate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nowadays 720p is not even considered a great achievement but actually expected from all high-end smartphones and there are even some reaching for the 1080p milestone. That?s doubling the video playback resolution in just under a year ? great progress indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, with ample screen estate, excellent codec support (including DivX and Xvid) and spotless performance, the title in this category goes to Samsung Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only does it have the mobile screen we consider most enjoyable for watching videos, but it also allows you to easily upload videos to it. A simple copy and paste from your computer would do and converting would very rarely be required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus our dedicated video test showed that the Galaxy S is pretty well performing in terms of battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However there is one device that managed to play videos for even longer than the Samsung Android flagship. The Apple iPhone 4 is the joint runner-up here with its great energy efficiency and flawless performance (that beast can even do 1080p with the right software).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately its screen size, iTunes dependability and limited default codec support deprive it of another first place in this article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead the iPhone 4 has to fight it out with the Nokia N8 for the title of second best portable player. We couldn?t get the Nokia handset to play files over 720p resolution or over 2GB in size, but it more than made up for that with its HDMI port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N8</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Best cameraphone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve spoken so much on the topic recently that we really don?t have much more to say. If you are taking photography with your mobile phone seriously, you have no other option but to go for the Nokia N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset has the best camera in a mobile phone we have seen and even managed to outdo a dedicated digicam in our blind test. Not only that, the N8 used its large sensor pretty well and got a considerable advantage over its cameraphone competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since the rest of the mobile world seems to have abandoned the cameraphone race over the past twelve months, there is just no other handset to recommend here. And most certainly, not one worthy of standing next to the N8 and its 12 megapixel, wide angle, large-sensor camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 is certainly not the most functional of platforms currently available (as a matter of fact it?s probably the least functional), but if there is one thing it?s good at, it?s social networking. The great integration, combined with the ultra high-end specs give up for flawless performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s why we felt picking a WP7 handset as the winner here would just be the right thing to do. And having tried almost all of them out, we are going for the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7. Super AMOLED screen, metal body and arguably the most decent camera among WP7 phones are what set it apart and since WP7 devices are virtually identical internally, those are a lot of aces in the Omnia 7 hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I8700 Omnia 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yeah, we realize those are not exactly related to social networking, but they are the only way to tell those handsets apart. Plus it?s not like you are going to use your mobile for Facebook only, are you?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If going for a platform with limited capabilities and unknown future is not exactly your cup of tea, we suggest you get a taste of the SNS-centered MOTOBLUR UI with the Motorola Defy. Compact, durable and nicely looking, this device will be more than adequate for keeping all your social network profiles updated even when you are on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Defy</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Most bang for your buck<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We all like high-end devices, but it?s the mid-range where really great deals sit, waiting for you to find them. Sacrificing small bits of performance for huge chunks of price is what the majority of people tries to do and here?s the deal for them this Christmas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprising as it may sound, given their rough year of very few announcement and sales decline, it?s LG who snatched this one. The Optimus One P500 is the smartphone that the market has desperately needed for at least a year now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus One P500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With okayish HVGA resolution, a capacitive multi-touch display, an auto-focus camera and Froyo, the latest by Android so far, it makes up for an extremely powerful combo on paper. The real great news is that the LG Optimus One performance cashes the checks that its specs sheet writes. You just cannot go wrong with this one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Compact smartphone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sometimes a device that fits in your pocket is worth more than one that can do all but the dishes. A compact smartphone is where those two meet and even though there are compromises on both sides, market numbers shows that there?s plenty of demand for such devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our favorite here is the Eclair-tasting Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. The lovable little fella has its UI specifically redesigned, so its smaller screen doesn?t turn into a usability concern and decent muscle under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, it only has QVGA screen, but that?s basically all that is wrong about it. After all the XPERIA X10 mini front plate measures only 83 x 50mm, which less than a box of cigarettes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want faster texting (assuming your fingers aren?t too big) you could also check out the Motorola FlipOut. At 67 x 67mm the device really managed to win our hearts when it came by for a review and that QWERTY keyboard is surprisingly comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola FlipOut</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively if screen resolution really is an issue for you, check out the Nokia C6-01. Its ClearBlack display fared pretty well in our display mega shootout and if it wasn?t for its weight we would have probably placed it top of this category. No matter that we like our gadgets nice and solid, 131g don?t feel right on a compact device such as this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camcorders for your pocket<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next up is video recording, which is again dominated by the Nokia imaging flagship N8. Its wide-angle lens, innovative digital zooming and great adaptability just don?t give its opponents a change to fight for the title here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is also good and if they could just release an official update that adds the continuous auto-focus that has been enabled by the hacker community, it would be nearing perfection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could also consider the iPhone 4 ? it took Apple four generations but the camera finally became a key selling point, rather than a crippled side feature. And despite a few issues such as the white balance, the oversaturation and the too narrow field-of-view in video mode, the fact that it offers the most resolved detail of all devices in the market is enough to secure it the second spot in the video recording category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other alternative to those that decide to pass on the N8 is the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. It?s Eclair update brought high-quality 720p videos and continuous focus, making it only the second smartphone to boast such camcorder specs (the first also being a handset by Sony Ericsson).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigation replacement<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As screens and processing power grow, smartphones are eating steadily into dedicated SatNav units market lately and there?s nothing unexpected about that. There are dozens of navigation apps available for different platforms and once they got those GPS receivers sensitivity right, there was just no reason to carry two devices anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Maps-powered Nokia C7 is the leader here. Ovi Maps probably isn?t the best available app, but it?s good enough and carries two key features that its rivals lack. It?s free all around the world and all its map data is available for offline use (data plans are not that cheap ? especially when travelling abroad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 itself offers a screen large enough to be easily visible when placed on your dashboard and it still remains perfectly legible in bright sun (a real must for a SatNav unit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is another device that boasts a similar (as a matter of fact even better) screen and a free navigation solution. The problem here is that Google Maps navigation is only available in selected countries and requires internet access at least at the time of route planning, which makes it less versatile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Screen size matters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Those who appreciate a bigger, brighter screens were treated to a pile of new offerings this year. They say once you get used to a huge display, there?s just no turning back so if you have been among the HTC HD2 adopters, you probably already considered the winner in this category ? the HTC Desire HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 4.3? the new HTC Android flagship is only beaten by the Dell Streak, but we do believe 5? is already going into tablet territory so we are leaving it out here. The HTC HD7 is supposed to have the same screen as the Desire HD but we?ve come to realize that our test unit is plagued by severe ghosting so we won?t be recommending this one either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are willing to go just a little bit lower ? to 4? you will get the chance to experience the Super AMOLED goodness of the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S. It might be a bit smaller than the Desire HD but it offers superior image quality so it might just be worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you could go for the extra resolution of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and live with the LCD shortcomings. You?d be saving yourselves quite a few bucks too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Instead of a conclusion we end this article on a selection of the less fortunate phones that were released this year. Some of the entries here are a textbook case of all that could go wrong. Others are great gadgets overall that just could've been - you know - a bit better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not implying that getting one of them for Christmas means you've been a naughty boy or girl. We've just given you tips for a possible thank you note to Santa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5250: Dear Santa, I know it's cheap. But does really EVERYONE else need to know? Anyway, non-consumer Christmas rocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5250</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7230E Wave 723: Dear Santa, you're the man. I can't even start to thank you. It's a samsung-s-seven-two-thirty-e-wave-seven-two-three. Is it me or is this letter coming a bit long? Sincerely?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S7230E Wave 723</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola CHARM: Dear Santa, are you kidding me? No? Oh? So CHARM it is, after all? Sorry, my bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola CHARM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro: Dear Santa, thank you for the mockup you sent me - absolutely love it! You can go ahead and tell the elves to start working on the full-size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GM360 Viewty Snap: Hey, Santa, that camcorder optic-all zoom feature is really cool. Could you please send a phone that can actually use it? Maybe one that records video, where you can tell a person from a bus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG GM360 Viewty Snap</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart: Dear Santa, there's been a mistake, I'm afraid. This was supposed to be a smartphone, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Smart</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 4: Now, this one will wet your pants. You'll be thrilled and wowed. You'll be in no mood for letters. You'll want to call the old man right away and tell him you love him. Just don't despair if your signal it's not at its best at this moment. And don't be a Scrooge, get yourself a bumper, will you?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>-Hello? Santa? ?Santa? Hello? Can you hear me?... Click.</paragraph>
