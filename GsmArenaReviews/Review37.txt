			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with market leaders there are plenty of smaller manufacturers who are keen to make a stand with some interesting devices. On the following pages you will find a summary of all those. We're starting off with Acer, newbies in the mobile phone industry, but a world leading manufacturer when it comes to mobile computers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer is no small name, but their forte is computers. In mobile phone terms they are newbies with a relatively short (but still high-end) portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today at the MWC 2010 they announced four new smartphones, along with an updated version of their Android-running Liquid. Check out the live photos that we snatched at their booth and stay tuned for our first impressions coming up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer neoTouch P300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Window Mobile 6.5, Acer neoTouch P300 relies on a slide-out full QWERTY keybord to cover its texting needs. The phone is built around a 3.2" touchscreen display and runs on a 528 MHz Qualcomm CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer neoTouch P300 is actually pretty compact for a full QWERTY side-slider. Despite that the QWERTY keyboard allows for decent typing speed, with well used space and decent layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't a wow factor or anything about the P300 design but it's not too bad either. It carries the air of a business tool, rather than a shiny gadget to boast about to your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its performance on the other hand is pretty solid. It's no Snapdragon inside and it shows but the occasional lagging is not really that bothering.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer neoTouch P400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second WinMo 6.5 device by Acer is the first member of a twin couple. Acer neoTouch P400 is a full touch handset with very little hardware controls whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four keys below the display are also touch-sensitive but need a slightly harder push than the display to register a click. We suppose they will fix that before it hits the shelves to equalize the effort needed and make up for a seamless transition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like its design better than the one of its slightly lower-end WinMo cousin. The unit we tested didn't have much to do in terms of UI customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly faster 600 MHz feels well on the HVGA screen opening most menus and applications in an instant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer beTouch E400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second twin is Acer beTouch E400 - a full-touch handset running on Android 2.1 and sporting a 3.2" HVGA screen. At first glance it's virtually indistinguishable from its WinMo brother, but a closer look reveals that the software keys are different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is of course done to suit the individual needs of the different platforms but the general hardware is perfectly identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer beTouch E400 packs some of the Acer's home-brewed UI tweaks but not as many as the Liquid e. Its performance is pretty good although.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting thing to note is that the beTouch E400 is among the few Android handsets that don't sport a capacitive screen. It suffers a bit in terms of responsiveness compared to the Liquid but it should compensate with better accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer beTouch E110<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other new member of the beTouch family - Acer beTouch E110 is an entry-level phone with a 2.8" display of QVGA resolution. Its capable battery will be greatly appreciated by users who believe that a mobile phone is good as long as it's capable of making that call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You don't see resistive touchscreen Android handsets too often but this is the second for today. The Acer beTouch E110 is also among the very few Google OS powered devices to have this low screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, the Android OS doesn't look very attractive on QVGA, with the icons being both too big and coarse. It looks like the developers never though Android would run on devices like that and the platform was never optimized for low-res displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the fact that the E110 isn't the most impressive device in terms of features doesn't mean we don't get Acer's point in releasing it. The company is obviously trying to achieve something big as a maker of phones and that usually means it has to look at the mass market too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, they only need to find a way for their low-end devices not to look that cheap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid e<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The third and last Android handset announced by Acer is simply an updated version of their popular Liquid phone. The Acer Liquid e runs on version 2.1 (Eclair) of the Google OS, but doesn't bring any hardware updates whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer also added the new version of their home-baked user interface to the Liquid e. It sports more transition effects, some new buttons and looks generally better than on the original liquid and the Acer E400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't help noting though, it would've made a lot more sense to release a simple firmware update rather than a new handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola are by no means a minor manufacturer but they've been through some hard times in the past few years. They've been on the rise lately releasing new high-end devices and Android obviously is their primary bet for survival (and prosperity, as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today at the MWC 2010 they present their next Android device - the Motorola QUENCH. Called CLIQ XT in the US, this new smartphone updates the existing Motorola DEXT (a.k.a. CLIQ) as a qwerty-less version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality the Motorola QUENCH is a pretty nice looking device, with the back feeling particularly great to touch. Its Android runs smooth without any hiccups but that was to be expected, considering its expected release date (later this month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MOTOBLUR interface is pretty cool actually and the capacitive touchscreen behaves just as expected. You can check them out in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here at the MWC 2010 we also see the strange Motorola BACKFLIP for the first time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola XT720 (previously codenamed as Sholes tablet) packs an 8 megapixel camera with a xenon flash and 720p video recording. It's an impressive smartphone in its own right, but unfortunately it won't make it outside Korea for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw another Motorola Android smartphone at the Motorola booth. It was the dual mode Motorola XT800. It's a China-only phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Garmin Asus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Garmin Asus had two new handsets in store for us this year. They were both officially announced several days before the MWC kicked off but are still very much an enigma to the mobile world. This time Garmin chose not to use a home-brewed OS but went for Android and Windows Mobile instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Garmin Asus A50<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The more interesting half of the newly announced couple is undoubtedly the Garmin Asus A50. Making best use of Garmin's experience and expertise in the mobile navigation area it ships with free voice-guided navigation and map data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the Garmin Asus A50 is also really impressive with spectacular viewing angles and sunlight legibility. The underlying Android OS ensures that there will be plenty of third party applications for the A50 so its prospects look much better than those of its G60 predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo video we took of the Garmin Asus nuvifone A50:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Garmin Asus M10<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Garmin Asus M10 achievement of being the first Windows Mobile 6.5.3 handset might have lost a large part of its glamour now that Microsoft announced WinMo 7 (okay, okay, Windows Phone series 7) but it is still a pretty cool device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great WVGA screen, sleek design and voice-navigation ready out of the box, the Garmin Asus M10 is definitely worth a second look. Not to mention the 512 MB of RAM that can put most of the current crop of smartphones to shame. And, oh yeah, it looks totally cool in that white too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We gotta say though that the Garmin SatNav application looks a lot better on Android, than that on Windows Mobile. Check out this short video of Garmin Asus M10:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Toshiba certainly aren't among the biggest manufacturers in terms of market share but for a second year in a row their MWC booth hosts some of the most interesting devices at the event.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba TG02<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It took Toshiba exactly one year to come up with a successor to their super slim PockePC TG01. Toshiba TG02 maintains the 9.9mm waistline and even slices a few millimeters off the other two dimensions (126 x 66mm vs. 129 x 70mm on the TG01). That makes for a lot more pocketable experience. Plus software optimizations have led to improved battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Toshiba TG02 uses the same 1 GHz Snapdragon CPU as its predecessor but replaces the resistive 4.1" touchscreen with a capacitive unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Toshiba TG02 runs Windows Mobile 6.5.3 and customizes its appearance with the latest Spb Mobile Shell that got announced at this MWC as well. The other interesting applications include Core video player (XviD and DivX video) and PhotoBase ? a thumbable third-party gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video demo of the Toshiba TG02:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba K01<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now for the really interesting part - Toshiba K01 is the slimmest QWERTY side-slider that we have seen to date. But if you think that Toshiba had to sacrifice performance in order to fit the K01 in a shell this small, you are mistaken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the same snappy 1GHz inside the K01, plus this time the huge 4.1" screen is AMOLED rather than LCD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>ELSE Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back in the days when ELSE Mobile announced their First ELSE smartphone they promised to revolutionize the mobile phone world. Of course, something like is that is much easier said than done but our first meeting with their product left us with quite positive impressions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First Else</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Powered by the well-known 600 MHz Cortex A8 CPU the First ELSE is a snappy little device that is simply a pleasure to use. The company has managed to put together a great interface both in term of looks and usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset itself handles nicely, even though it may not be the sleekest device around. The capacitive touchscreen is pretty responsive but we were promised that the handset will see even further improvements and optimization before it hits the shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is still a big problem standing on the path of the First ELSE. To compete with the rest of the smart platforms out there, Else MOBILE needs to find a way to attract 3rd party software developers. Their product is fully LiMo compliant, so that's a step forward. But a host of some specialized third party apps will definitely help it along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a short video demonstrating the interface of the First Else. Here it comes:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dell Mini3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Dell Mini3 duo of smartphones is no longer a novelty but due to limitations of market availability, this is the first time we see them in person. The Dell Mini 3i is the 2G model headed to China and running the custom oPhone OS. The Dell Mini 3iX is the 3G variety that runs vanilla Andropid OS and it should make it to Brazil. We certainly hope wider availability is not out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones have almost identical design and you can hardly distinguish them if it's not their UI. We gotta say we love the oval shapes of both. They are sized just about right and fit nicely in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we were more interested in the 3G-enabled Mini 3iX, which at least has slight chances of getting European availability.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synaptics Fuse<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been a while since we last heard of the Synaptics Fuse full touch phone concept. For a quick refresh, the Fuse is a prototype, a technology showcase. It's a phone loaded with an array of sensors, each allowing unusual way of interacting with the 3D-accelerated UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Force sensors on the sides allow you to control scrolling by simply squeezing the phone. Those same sides have touch sensors that enable another type of scrolling - by finger sweeps along the sides. Come to think of it, this is one of the most convenient scrolling methods that we have seen because you don't even have to reach for the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone is also touch-sensitive and allows for 2D navigation throughout the interface. Just push your finger against the back panel of the Fuse as if you're pressing the backside of an icon you're seeing on screen, et voila. Okay this one might not be too practical but its cool looking nonetheless and saves the screen some fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Synaptics Fuse uses a WVGA AMOLED screen and is powered by a Cortex A8 based processor with PowerVR SGX graphics chip. The user interface is developed specifically for the Fuse and offers some cool eye-candy and 3D graphics. For example, the icons on screen turn as you tilt the screen, so you can see them from the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo video of the Synaptics Fuse phone in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Synaptics don't intend to create a market-ready product out of the Fuse. It will stay a concept unless a cellphone manufacturer is interested enough to give it a try. Synaptics are more than willing to sell the technology - even separate bits of it, this kind of scrolilng or that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stay tuned for a video of the Synaptics Fuse in action.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Puma phone by Sagem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As teased last week, today Puma announced their first Puma phone. Manufactured by Sagem, the touchscreen device is naturally quite sports-oriented but it also offers a solar back panel for using solar energy as backup power source.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Puma phone by Sagem features a nice red UI to match the signature Puma logo (white on red) that runs on a 2.8-inch touchscreen display. A 3.2 megapixel camera and a GPS receiver rounds off the most notable specs on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It breaks our heart that the Puma phone would cost nearly 400 euro. But don't let that spoil the fun and check out the fancy themed UI:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In keeping with their habit, Alcatel revealed quite a bunch of new phones at the MWC. Sitting in their booth there were no less than eight new handsets, which is more than any other maker out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there is the little issue that most of those are only dummies and not actually working but they still kinda count. If a carrier shows interest in any of the designs, it will likely be prepared for market release.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-980<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The big gun at the booth (big in Alcatel terms anyway) was the Alcatel OT-980. The QWERTY-equiped touchscreen device is running on Android, and that makes it the first ever Alcatel smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of its ammo includes Wi-Fi and 3G with HSPA. Well, okay, design appeal isn't completely out of the question either as, cheap materials aside, it resembles a certain Palm handset with the same form factor (you didn't hear us say Pre, did you?)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can expect the Alcatel OT-980 to arrive some time in the second quarter of the year.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-880 XTRA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen meets a slide-out full QWERTY keyboard in the Alcatel OT-880 XTRA too. The side slider offers a much larger keyboard than its regular slider cousin but lacks the smartphone capabilities. It certainly does look a bit better though, and its launch is scheduled for Q1 this year.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-806<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The third device that Alcatel introduced in the Crossover category as they call it is the OT-806. This time there is no sliding involved and the QWERTY keyboard and touschreen display share a panel. Another selling point is Wi-Fi connectivity. The OT-806 should come in Q3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-909<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-909 is the first of three full touch handsets that the company unveiled. With 3G, GPS, microSD card slot and a built-in FM transmitter it's the best spec'd representative of the Touch category.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-708 and Alcatel OT-710<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other two members of the full-touch Alcatel family are OT-708 and OT-710. Compact and with distinct youthful appeal, fun-to-use is likely their strongest asset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-800<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel OT-800 will come in three different flavors - the youthful Tribe and the more mature Chrome and Carbon versions. Those will have different designs but identical functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-808<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking more like a powder compact than a mobile phone and coming in pink, the Alcatel OT-808 is definitely a phone aimed at the ladies. It sports Facebook and Twitter plus a full QWERTY keyboard so we can certainly see some potential there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-606<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel promote the OT-606 as a dedicated messaging phone and it certainly looks the part. Almost as basic as they get in terms of both hardware and software, the Alcatel OT-606 only has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard to brag about.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Opera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Opera used the MWC to showcase a couple of new browsers. The iPhone OS will be the next platform to get some Opera Mini love, while Android is treated to a beta version of the Opera Mobile browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to get our hands on an iPhone and a Nexus One running those latest Norwegian goods. Unfortunately we weren't allowed to take any photos for some unknown (legal?) reasons. We however managed to build a good idea of their capabilities.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mini for iPhone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike most other platforms, the iPhone OS will be getting the Opera Mini as a native application, rather than a Java one. Speculations about getting Java apps to run on the iPhone turned out wrong, so the iPhone OS will be having a completely different Opera Mini experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interesting piece of trivia for you: Did you know what the only other OS is to have a native Opera Mini app? Thought so. Well, believe it or not, it's BREW.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is what impressed us most about the Opera Mini, running on iPhone. The thing is blazing fast, outdoing its Java cousin by quite a margin. Even at this early beta stage the scrolling is as smooth as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Opera Mini for iPhone uses the same routine as on other platforms: a remote server compresses the site before sending it to your handset. Hence, it comes with the standard 2 zoom levels that are triggered by double tapping. Pinch freaks are out of luck, it's still not implemented and may never be (sounds redundant with only two zoom levels available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet our experience showed that none of the Mini shortcomings is too bad and it makes for a great data-conscious browser for the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The harder question to answer though concerns the public availability of the Opera Mini for the iPhone. The guys over at Opera claim they have studied the Apple Appstore rules very carefully and there isn't a single reason for rejection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However Apple have the right to reject any submitted application without explanation, so you never know. Anyway, judging from how the app works we are guessing its code is pretty close to being complete and we should be finding out soon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mobile 10 beta for Android<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Opera also demoed the first beta of their Opera Mobile 10 browser for the Android platform. We saw one of the most advanced web browsers in action, running on a Google Nexus One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Opera Mobile 10 for Android is still in the very early stages of its development, judging by its features and performance. There isn't even a proper zooming method yet, be it double tap or pinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those will of course be developed before the browser's official release and its performance should massively improve. However, the Symbian and WinMo platforms have quite an advantage here as their Opera Mobile 10 versions already feel pretty stable and work great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you're interested in web browsing on your mobile, you might as well check out our Touch web browser mega shootout for an in-depth analysis and benchmarking of the best.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei are by no means among the big mobile phone manufacturers, but they introduced a couple of new handsets at the MWC. They are all touch-driven and pack mid-range functionality in simple and relatively compact bodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei U8100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei U8100 is a 3G-packing Android handset, built around a 2.8? QVGA touchscreen. It has a simplistic design and carries a 3 megapixel camera. Huawei have added some touches of their own to the UI, making the homescreen two-dimensional. You can now scroll vertically too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei U8110 (T-Mobile Pulse Mini)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei U8110 will also have a rebranded T-Mobile version, the Pulse Mini. A really compact Android handset with a slightly tweaked UI, this one definitely has some potential, though QVGA resolution doesn't do Android no justice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out the video demonstration of its interface below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
