			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android smartphone market in 2013 is as over-crowded as ever. But when it comes to the very high-end, luckily for everybody, there are not that many options. Every manufacturer has a single flagship and that's it. Or is it? Last time we checked, Samsung has been selling not one, but two flagship smartphones and to make matters worse, they both go under the name of Galaxy S 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Potential buyers are left scratching their heads as both versions are priced about the same, with prices varying only negligibly from market to market. And both handsets are virtually indistinguishable from one another, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's right, they both sound the same, they both cost the same, and they both look the same, but on the inside - their brains are quite different. The Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9505 is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 600 chipset, while the Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 relies on Samsung's own Exynos 5 Octa chipset, which, as its name implies, makes use of no less than eight CPU cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Octa is available only on a few select markets, and the Snapdragon 600 version is shaping up to be what we like to call the "international" model. Despite what some would have you believe, the reason for pushing the (initially intended only for the US) Snapdragon version to international markets is not its exclusive LTE support. It seems both chipsets are perfectly capable of providing LTE connectivity. It's manufacturing issues that Samsung is blaming for the low production numbers of its home-brewed Exynos 5 Octa chipset. This is the reason behind the shift of the Snapdragon 600 into being the more widely available offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We finally have the two versions on our proverbial desk. All that's left is to see whether the different brains also mean different hearts and souls. That - we'll only be able to tell, after we're done with this shootout. So you are welcome to join in. One thing's for sure, both of these are some of the fastest smartphones to have set foot in our office and we better hurry up so we can catch up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both versions of Samsung's Android flagship for 2013 breeze through not only the heavily TouchWiz-coated Android, but also through any application or game you throw at them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Exynos 5 Octachipset utilizes ARM's big.LITTLE chipset architecture. It mates a set of four low-power Cortex-A7 cores with a set of four beefier Cortex-A15 cores to provide better balance between power consumption and performance. In the case of the Exynos 5 Octa, quad 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 cores take care of trivial UI tasks, as well as calls and messaging. When demand for performance increases, the four 1.6GHz Cortex-A15 cores step up to the job at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, the Snapdragon 600 that's in control under the hood of the Galaxy S4 GT-I9505 relies purely on the quad-core 1.9GHz Krait 300 CPU inside to be power efficient when there's not much to be done, and performance-oriented when there is. It's clocked considerably higher than the Cortex-A15s, which usually means more power consumption, but also more power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the CPUs aren't the only difference between the two chipsets - the GPUs are different models, too. The Adreno 320 clocked at 450MHz is the graphics guru in the Snapdragon 600, while the tri-core 533MHz PowerVR SGX544 GPU is in charge of graphics on board the Exynos chipset. If the latter sounds familiar, that's because it's not exactly new, but the extra core and clock speed should give it an edge over its Adreno counterpart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin with the benchmarks, it should be noted that while technically true, the Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 isn't exactly an octa-core device in the sense that only a set of four cores is working at any single time. This means that when things get really hairy, the Cortex-A7 doesn't provide any additional computational power to the Cortex-A15.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both versions of the Galaxy S4 smoke the competition out of the water in the BenchmarkPi test. Interestingly, there isn't a winner among them, as they both score the same score.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Linpack measures the speed of how fast an Android device can solve a standard calculation in MFLOPS (millions of floating point operations per second). Here, the more powerful Cortex-A15 cores take the edge on the Krait 300, but only by a narrow margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 is a cross-platform benchmark, which measures both CPU and memory performance. It allows us to compare the Galaxy Samsung Galaxy S4 against the iPhone 5, but our main focus here is how the Octa and Snapdragon 600 versions differ, and the former takes this one as well with almost 100 score points.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on to compound benchmarks, AnTuTu and Quadrant put the Galaxy Samsung Galaxy S4 with Exynos on top - the octa-core version is once again slightly faster.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Now let's look at the GPU benchmarks. We ran GLBenchmark 2.7 in 1080p off-screen mode, which is also the native screen resolution for the flagships. The Galaxy Samsung Galaxy S4 (S600) came out ahead of the HTC One here, which leads us to suspect that the GPU has been overclocked, just like the CPU. The S4 (Octa) was a couple of frames faster.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When it comes to JavaScript performance both Galaxy S4 variants are in a class of their own. HTML5 performance is fast as well, but as Vellamo points out, it still needs some work as far as compatibility with the latest standard is concerned. Nevertheless, the difference between the two remains negligible.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As far as synthethic benchmarks are concerned there isn't too much of a difference between the Octa and Snapdragon 600 versions of Samsung's best droid yet. We suspect this is on purpose - Samsung wanted to guarantee that devs can expect the exact same level of performance form the Galaxy S4, regardless of which version the user has. And they've done an excellent job. But this isn't the best that Cortex-A15 in the Exynos chipset is capable of - we might have to wait until the Galaxy Note III to get a true feel for its performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Under the hood of both versions of the Galaxy S4 lies a 2600mAh battery, which is more than what the competitors of the device currently pack. We were wondering whether the Exynos chipset reaps any benefits from the eight-core big.LITTLE architecture compared to the quad-core Snapdragon sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the Snapdragon variant did really well in our set of battery tests. It proved that both Samsung and Qualcomm had done a phenomenal job of optimizing the software and hardware parts of the phone. The eight-core version, on the other hand, posted considerably worse results than its sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the talk time battery test, the Galaxy S4 Octa managed to achieve 11 hours and 1 minute versus over 18 hours and 3 minutes on the Galaxy S4 600. It is in this test where the screen is switched off and the main processors are free from any substantial computations, that you can really tell that the Exynos 5 Octa still needs a lot of work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the web browsing test, which not only stresses the chipset, but also takes its toll on the Super AMOLED displays with the predominantly white webpages it packs. Here, the Exynos 5 Octa did a much better job than it did on the call test, but it still fell behind the Snapdragon 600 version, though not by that much - it lasted only half an hour less.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is mainly a task for the GPU and in the video playback test the Galaxy S4 Octa delivered an hour less than the Galaxy S4 600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 11 hours and 29 minutes, it still put out a respectable performance and is far ahead of the rest of the Android competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Clearly, the Exynos 5 Octa and its quad Cortex-A15 and quad Cortex-A7 cores have a lot of potential. Samsung is just starting to harness their power and to get the most out of both in terms of power output and optimization. Unfortunately, as things stand right now, the Exynos chipset is far from besting the Snapdragon chipset in the battery performance department. We have got to remember that the octa-core chipset did a little better with the benchmarks in the performance section however that's not enough to warrant the real-life difference in the battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would be interesting to see whether Samsung would be able to improve on the performance/battery life ratio of the octa-core edition some moment in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point in time, the Galaxy S4 i9505 packs an endurance rating of 69 hours as opposed to the Galaxy S4 i9500 having a rating of only 65 hours.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the differences in the hardware departments of both Galaxy S4 versions, the camera is still the same. Samsung has packed a 13MP snapper inside, which captures stills with a resolution of up to 4128 x 3096 pixels. There's a 2MP camera on the front and both cams can snap a photo or record video simultaneously, but that's not going to be the focus of this section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the camera units appear to be pretty much the same. The differences in the photo samples are minor and are part due to the quickly changing weather conditions and the different way the chipset processes and outputs the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the minor differences is that the color reproduction. The Galaxy S4 Octa churns up photos that pack a tad more saturated colors, especially the blues. Additionally, the photo taken with the eight-core version have a bit more detail, than the quad-core one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This however, isn't necessarily due to the difference in camera sensors, but rather the software versions of both phones, as they do differ - XXUAMDE for the i9500 vs. XXUAMDC for the i9505. The Exynos Galaxy S4 has newer software version, which might be an explanation for the different camera processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we turned HDR on, we also encountered some minor differences. The Galaxy S4 (600) did better in exposing properly the highlights and the shadows simultaneously. That's properly due to a slightly flatter contrast curve, so again, it's a matter of camera tuning. Plus, the difference is not that big (or that noticeable with the naked eye).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a comparison, which demonstrates the difference in the resolved dynamic range of both cameraphones with the HDR mode on. The highlighted areas is where there is a loss in image information due to clipping, so the less highlighting there is, the better. Still, it's really hard to notice the difference in dynamic range between the two with a naked eye without the help of computer software.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Here it might be useful to see the face off between the Samsung Galaxy S4 and its octa-core brother, along with the Xperia Z added for good measure. Our our Photo quality compare tool allows you to compare the image quality in three different scenes. You can also pit the phones against the last generation of flagships with 8MP cameras by using the upscale and downscale features of the tool.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Both the Snapdragon and Exynos versions of the Galaxy S4 store videos in MP4 files with the bitrate averaging 17Mbps. Stereo audio is recorded at around 128Kbps bitrate with a 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Details and noise levels are somewhat the same on both videos, recorded by the two versions of the Galaxy S4. Colors and white balance is also virtually the same. Here, in video, there are no notable differences in performance or scene rendering.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality evenly matched<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both Samsung Galaxy S4 versions did greatly in our audio quality test. They both had excellently clean output in both testing scenarios and despite the fact that they use different audio chips, their output is quite hard to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Qualcomm-powered Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 had the tinniest of edges in the headphones-plugged-in testing scenario, exhibiting slightly cleaner audio output, but we doubt anyone will be able to hear the difference. The Exynos-packing I9500 Galaxy S4 makes up for it with an advantage that's a bit easier to hear on your own - slightly higher maximum volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter which of the versions of the Samsung flagship you choose, you will be more than happy with its output and certainly we wouldn't advise you to make your selection based on the audio output - it's just that it's too close to call here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As evident from our head-to-head so far, for most practical purposes the two Galaxy S4 variants are almost identical - and that's especially true for their looks. You would be hard-pressed to find a visual difference between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single biggest difference between these S4 versions is the chipset used - an octa-core Exynos in the i9500 and a quad-core Snapdragon 600 in the I9505.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance-wise, the octa-core Exynos has a slight advantage, but that's not because of the higher number of cores. You have got to remember that only a single set of four cores is active at a any single time - either the power-sipping Cortex A7's or the number-crunching Cortex A15's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is evident from our tests however, that the Exynos version of the Galaxy S4 is not much more powerful than the Snapdragon 600. Furthermore, the battery life performance of the Exynos-touting variant is consistently worse than the one by the Snapdragon 600 version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We feel that the gains in battery life of the Snapdragon 600 outweigh the gains of the slightly better performance of the Exynos chipset. And since everything else is pretty much the same, we'd say that the more sensible choice would be the variant with Snapdragon 600. Of course, that would be valid only if both sell at around the same price, which seems to be the case as we are writing this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, it is highly unlikely that both variants will be offered on one and the same regional market simultaneously, so in the end you may not be the one to make the choice. Still, with the Exynos version seeing some hard times with alleged production issues, we won't be surprised to see more of those Snapdragon S4's selling around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just don't get us wrong. In either case you are getting one helluva smartphone. The Octa version may not take it as easy on the battery as the Snapdragon version, but not only does it come with some serious bragging rights, but we have every reason to believe we may see a better performance out of the Exynos chipset further down the road, once it gets more mature and Samsung gets the chance to further optimize the system performance. Or not, we are yet to see about that. Perhaps Samsung is keen on keeping both phones at around the same performance level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that being said, no matter which of these fine smartphones Samsung sells you, the company seems to have itself covered that its 2013 flagship will still be relevant in the market even once the new Apple iPhone gets announced this fall. These are some future-proof smartphones, that's for sure. And you can bet that Samsung will capitalize successfully on the appeal of the S4 by releasing a host of mid-range smartphones that look just like it - just like we saw with the s-three-fying of Samsung's portfolio last year. And that's for a good reason. Even though it may not be ground-breaking, the Galaxy S4 surely is a worthwhile flagship for Samsung to keep in their stable.</paragraph>
