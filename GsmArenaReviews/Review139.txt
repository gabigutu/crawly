			<paragraph>The world's first 720p HD video recording on a mobile phone was top of our list of trend-setting features revealed at this year's MWC in Barcelona. But even if you take HD from the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD you will still have enough skill and guts to go around. It's Symbian-powered, it's touch-controlled, it's a monster of a cameraphone. For all we know, a device like that is always worth another look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, here's the deal. We're not just taking another look at the Samsung Omnia HD, we hope it's a closer, and more revealing look. A second preview is a rare honor but then, the Samsung Omnia HD is a rare piece of technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD is getting closer to release and the new unit we have is much different than the real early bird we checked out back in February. It's been a while, so here's what Samsung have been up to with the Omnia HD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To get it straight, the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD (or just i8910 HD in select markets as of lately) hasn't lost a bit of its HD magic. The 720p video playback and recording are all intact and can be enjoyed in their full shine on the more mature device we're testing this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same goes for the 8-megapixel snapper that sports autofocus, digital image stabilization, geo-tagging, beside face, smile and blink detection. Along come the enormous 3.7" capacitive AMOLED touchscreen and the other goodies that complete the Omnia HD. Like the touch-optimized Symbian OS and TouchWiz 3D, WLAN support and built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, before you start wondering what the fuss is all about, we're focusing on the evolution of the Omnia HD. Other than the design and hardware changes, this preview is looking closer at the interface and the coexistence of Symbian and TouchWiz. Prepare for great video playing and plenty of video and still camera samples. We've tried to make it less talk, more action, so let's roll.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new sample we're looking at is still a pre-release unit but we guess it won't be much different from the retail version. Shape, size and weight haven't changed and no, the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is not the most compact phone around. At 12.9mm, it can almost be called slim but its weight of 144g is respectable, to say the least.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There have been some changes in the Omnia HD looks since we first saw it a couple of months ago. Some minor adjustments on the front are notable, which don't really affect the handling of the phone. The rear has changed more dramatically and we're not sure we quite like it that way. The now hot-swappable microSD card slot and the enabled haptic feedback for the screen are of course more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside some minor stuff, the front panel of Samsung i8910 is the same as we know it from day one. Most of it is taken by Omnia HD's key feature - the 3.7" 16M-color AMOLED touchscreen enclosed in a glossy metallic frame. The handset uses the capacitive touchscreen technology as opposed to the resistive screen of the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic - the first S60 5th edition handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only difference here is the Samsung logo has moved from beneath the screen to the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive technology used guarantees the excellent responsiveness of the screen at the expense of making it unable to work with anything else but your fingers - no stylus, no plectrum, no anything? Still, there are some capacitive screen styluses ot there that are said to do the job, but we haven't tried them ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handwriting recognition is supported though - the screen is large enough to allow writing with your finger. Of course, you can go for the other two input options too - the onscreen numpad or the virtual QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of Samsung i8910 offers amazing picture quality. The resolution of 360 x 640 pixels (same as Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and Nokia N97) is not exactly top of the line but the AMOLED technology does make a difference. The contrast and colors are really impressive making every image look really sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news about the display of Samsung i8910 is that its legibility drops dramatically under direct sunlight. Now that we have a more recent reference, the Omnia HD screen is a cut above the LG KM900 Arena and LG GC900 Viewty Smart in terms of sunlight legibility, but still remains inferior to the iPhone for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD display offers haptic feedback, which makes the touchscreen a passable replacement of a hardware keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other noteworthy elements at the face of the Samsung i8910 are the video-call camera and the proximity sensor at the top, plus the three hardware keys at the bottom. The proximity sensor is used for locking the display during calls to avoid accidental presses when holding the phone next to you cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD has hardware Call and End keys plus a menu key, much like the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. They are made of plastic (just like the silvery frame around the display). The keys look almost the same as on the very first unit we had but this time feel better and offer a more solid press. The End key doubles as a power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side we find the volume rocker, which is adequately sized and quite easy to work with. Next to it is the microSD card slot, which is one of the most important changes. On the very first Omnia HD unit we had the memory card was only accessible after removing the battery. Thanks to the externally accessible slot, hot-swap is now enabled and the handset is all set in terms of storage - 8/16 GB inbuilt, topped with a hot-swappable expansion slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Omnia HD is said to support microSD cards of up to 16GB, and this was as far as went testing it. The handset handled a full 16GB microSD card problem-free. We were pleased with the reading/writing speed and the initialization of a full microSD card was very fast.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Samsung i8910 hosts the hold key (to lock/unlock the touchscreen), the camera key and the microUSB port. It's a welcome benefit that the phone charges off the microUSB port so you can transfer data and charge your battery simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Samsung i8910 we find a loudspeaker and the 3.5mm standard audio jack. Much like the USB port, is the audio jack is hidden under a small lid to keep dust away. There is a slight difference to the beta unit here as well. The loudspeaker now is in the center and the stripes are replaced with dots. No big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A second loudspeaker is located at the bottom (dead center, again), along with the mouthpiece. This layout seems a respectful nod to the Omnia HD exceptional video skill, around which everything seems to revolve. We guess a landscape desk stand will be an essential and widely appreciated accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our first i8910 Omnia HD preview based on a very early pre-production sample, we were more than impressed with its full metal battery cover and the handy release latch. Unfortunately, the more recent version takes a completely different approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither is it made of metal, nor is the release mechanism so reliable. The Omnia HD rear is now all glossy plastic, which turns into a fingerprint nightmare. We fear that with time the cover is expected to start playing up - at this point it doesn't fit firmly in place and will occasionally pop open at the slightest pressure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the Samsung logo, the back side of the Omnia HD also hosts the 8 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. With video recording so high on the agenda, it's quite understandable why they went for the LED technology instead of xenon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's no lens protection - that's another unwelcome change from the first unit we previewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the sun will shine even on the Omnia HD rear and in our case it's the great 1500 mAh battery, which we found under the cheapish battery cover. Given the AMOLED screen with its low power consumption, the Omnia HD should count on above average battery life. After all, this is crucial for a multimedia device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During the testing period, we got some good 5 h and 30 min of constant video playback with the screen set at maximum brightness. That's better than what most laptops offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of Samsung i8910 Omnia HD now is lower than expected. The huge AMOLED display is true high end stuff but the plastic bits (especially the battery cover) are below par. The hardware and design changes are a mixed bag really but we guess the multimedia performance will make up for it big time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we should again point out that the huge screen real estate calls for some extraordinary body dimensions as well. Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is easily among the largest handsets on the market, even though it's reasonably slim. Comfortable single-handed operation will definitely be an issue for some users - so a try-before-you-buy is advisable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian OS meets TouchWiz 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is Samsung's first Symbian powered touchscreen device and it turns out it's not a blind follower of Nokia 5800 XpressMusic or N97 but a device with plenty of character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first you might not recognize the Symbian OS under the cheerful TouchWiz homescreen guise. The customized UI has not only changed the menu icons but has managed to camouflage the i8910 Omnia HD into a typical Samsung touchscreen feature phone to improve user friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is very responsive but that was to be expected. What's more important is the UI. There are some lags at times but the overall performance is remarkable. The 600 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 CPU and the dedicated graphic chip are doing a fine job. Given the massive screen, you are sure to need quite a lot of processing power but the results are even somewhat exceeding our expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD has 128MB of RAM - exactly as much as the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. However, due to the snappier CPU, the Omnia HD delivers much better overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: The new Samsung i8910 Omnia HD unit we received actually has 256MB of RAM. It was only the first unit we tested that came with 128MB, which is probably the cause for this misprint. Thanks for pointing that out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three homescreen layouts (so called Home screen themes) - Finger use, Samsung Widget and Basic. The names speak clearly enough of what stands behind them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one reminds of a standard S60 homescreen. Only the icons are now bigger, touch-friendlier. All icons can be changed to meet the user needs. We like it, it's convenient enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Basic theme is selected, on top of the homescreen you only get the date, time, and network logo, followed by the standard buttons at the bottom - Telephone, Contacts, Messaging and Menu. The standard foursome of virtual buttons is available regardless of the theme chosen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Definitely the most familiar option among the homescreen layouts is the Samsung Widget set. Widgets are getting more and more popular and the reason is quite understandable - some of the most frequently used features and services are just a tap away on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, you can arrange three completely different homescreens full of widgets. Switching between them is handled by the three small cubes in the top right corner of the screen. You can hide those of the widgets you use least (or don't use at all), as well as download new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature that sets the Omnia HD apart from the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is the rolling cube. Finger sweeps flip the screen left and right to display three different sides of the cube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A sweep to the right will take you to the Photo Contacts feature, which is quite a catch. It allows you to assign a whole image or a small part of it to entries in the phonebook. We've seen it before but it still manages to impress: it works as easy as it sounds and - more importantly - it's not only helpful but fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To go to the main menu from the homescreen you can either tap the appropriate button (bottom right) or by a sweep to the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the colorful outfit there's the Symbian S60 5th Edition. And if it weren't for those familiar shortcomings, it would've been great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are talking about the way you scroll and access items in listed menus. In some situations a single tap is enough to get access to the chosen item, while in others you need (1) a tap to select the item and (2) another one to confirm. Now, that's something you don't normally see in other touch phones and seems to hurt usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The explanation is simple: on S60 5th the touchscreen is doing the job of a D-pad with confirm action. You scroll a selector down a list rather than dragging the actual list as in other makers' solutions, which we find much more fluent and intuitive. One benefit of course is that the touch-optimized S60 stays absolutely faithful to the original, so users feel so much at home. But we do believe it is by far not the best touchscreen interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's get back to the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, most menus of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD can be displayed as either a grid or a list. The menu organization is pretty intuitive and logical, most items located exactly where you would expect them to be. The two virtual soft keys make sure making your way around won't be any different than a regular S60 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the very early unit, the accelerometer is now available across various menu levels and autorotation is fairly smooth with a fade out effect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia: Now we're talking!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD strengths lie in multimedia and this part of our preview brings out the beast with a load of sample videos and images.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard 3.5 mm audio jack, the Omnia HD music features are well complemented by the generous 8 to 16 GB of onboard memory and support for microSDHC cards to at least double this amount.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the music player is based on the one we've seen in Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. The novelty here is the virtual 5.1 channel Dolby Surround, which should dramatically improve the headphones listening experience. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait for a retail Samsung i8910 unit to share our impressions of the feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DNSe 2.0 audio enhancement is also on board but does not work simultaneously with the Dolby Surround.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing our trip down the road, the 3D visualizations are a nice touch to the music player and the album browser seems to take after Apple's Cover Flow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung announced that Omnia HD should have also had a built-in FM transmitter. Unfortunately, this feature was missing from our test unit and when we went to research that, it turned out that any mentioning of an FM transmitter have also gone missing from Samsung web sites as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD features two video players - the well known Symbian-embedded Real player is pretty much rendered useless by the proprietary Video player that supports DivX/XviD video. The Samsung Video player has a plain but intuitive interface and does a grand job. It even supports subtitles which are automatically detected and loaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tilt the phone the video player automatically switches to/from landscape view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great 3.7" display and the widely spaced apart stereo speakers make the Samsung Omnia HD a serious competitor to the dedicated portable multimedia player. Plus we got 5h and 30min of constant SD XviD playback time out of the battery with the brightness set to maximum. That should tell you something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we couldn't get any HD videos to play on the Omnia HD except for the ones taken by its own camera. Plus most of the HD videos come in the MKV file container, which is not recognized by the Omnia HD. Another known restriction, is that it cannot play video files larger than 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Knowing you can make your own HD movies with the i8910 now, seems to make a lot of people wonder how they would watch those on their HD TV sets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Samsung Omnia HD doesn?t have a HDMI port of any kind and the only way you can stream your HD videos to a bigger screen (be it TV or a PC) is via the DLNA wireless setup that uses Wi-Fi to share multimedia files wirelessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To use that with your TV however, you have to get yourself a Wi-Fi-enabled TV set with DLNA support or a set-top box that has the same properties an that can channel your wirelessly streamed videos over a cable HDMI connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung reps also mentioned they might actually sell an external DLNA-enabler for TVs that don?t have the feature, but that?s still to be confirmed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If however you are ready to consort to lower resolution videos, you can always use the TV-out port on the device itself that?s intended for transferring SD (non-HD) content via a cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the video players, the there are two galleries as well. The one is identical to Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. It is is yet another part of the interface that hasn't been drastically changed. Touch friendly and functional it definitely is but we somehow feel more eye-candy could have been offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll pictures by sweeping your finger across the screen when looking at a single photo. Opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer. Unless you have that feature disabled, all you need to do to switch modes is to flip the phone sideways.The gallery screams Samsung - you've seen it. You know it well. It's easy to use and works fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second gallery, dubbed as Media browser, screams Samsung - chances are you've already seen it on other Samsung touch handsets. It's easy to use and works fine. Scrolling images and videos happens by sweeping your finger across the screen or by tilting the handset to the left or to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilt scrolling is fun, at start. But then, in a while it gets annoying: you have to be careful and not to tilt the handset too much since the angle corresponds to scrolling speed and you might miss an image or two. Still, we choose this gallery over the Symbian one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser: Flash video and all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another favorite part of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is its web browser. It's the same as the one found in Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and shares the same turn ons and offs with it. The only thing the browser omits, given the big capacitive touchscreen, is multi-touch support, which would have made things even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 web browser has flash support including flash video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation and digital compass are on board as well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is still no navigation software preloaded on the Samsung Omnia HD. Back when we first heard of the device, Samsung suggested they would offer the Samsung Mobile Navigator software (based on Route66) as an option for a premium price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since then we haven?t heard more about it, but even if Samsung don?t come up with their own solution, there are enough third-party developers waiting to earn some cash by offering navigation software for Symbian S60 5th edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another seemingly cool feature that the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD has is the digital compass, otherwise known as a magnetometer. After a relatively quick initialization, it displays a virtual compass on screen. Our disappointment is that at the time being it doesn?t offer any further functionality. But perhaps it would really come into its own when it?s coupled with a fully-featured GPS navigation software.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD packs a 8 megapixel camera unit and given the promising results the Omnia HD achieved in our first preview, we were eager to find out how much progress has been made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED flash might be a disappointment to some but the reason is LED can also be used as a video light. And video is certainly what the phone is really about. We'll get to it in a little while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is comfortable enough to work with and the UI has been altered to provide better touch experience. Unlike the first samples, the camera interface is now very comfortable with the most frequently used shortcuts only a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The range of settings offered by the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is immense: from manual white balance and ISO to exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast. Various effects are also at hand as well as face and smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smile shutter is trying to make sure the person you are photographing is going to be smiling on the photo. You just press the shutter and the camera will automatically detect when your subject is smiling and take the shot. We tried it several times and it worked pretty well, although if there are several faces in the frame the camera doesn't wait for all of them to smile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blink detection is also available but it only alerts you that the person on the photo you just took has blinked. This one certainly is more of a marketing gimmick than anything else. It would have been more useful if the camera delayed taking the shot instead. In other words - it's better to help you avoid making a crappy photo than yelling at you for doing so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The geotagging of images is also enabled this time around and this is certainly good news. The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD puts the built-in GPS receiver to use, recording the location of each photo in the EXIF.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is pretty much as good as we have seen on a mobile phone. The color rendering is spot-on, contrast and dynamic range are also great. Fine detail is also very good although if anything could be improved - that's exactly it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about the camera is there are no visible defects of any kind. No traces of oversharpening, no lack of contrast and no excessive noise. Plus, getting the exposure right at all times makes sure most of the photos are keepers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared quite a large number of samples for you to enjoy and appreciate the fine quality of the images taken with the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's also a bunch of samples that demonstrate what can you achieve with the Samsung Omnia and some basic knowledge of image editing. Worth a cheer, right?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD videos - they don't get any better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already told you that the Omnia HD (as the name suggests) is mostly about video. 720p HD video recording appears for the first time on a GSM handset and the excitement is quite worth it. The frame rate is also pretty sweet at 24 fps. WVGA will have to bow its respects - 720p HD videos are about triple the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in the day the first VGA videos on a mobile phone were a disaster - merely a fat spec rather than a usable feature. So, what's even more impressive about the Omnia HD is getting the stunning video resolution right the first try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the video clips taken with the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD lives up to the high expectations. The videos have splendid resolution and good frame rate and look almost as if taken with a mid-range camcorder. Long range optical zoom and optical image stabilization however are still a major asset of digital camcorders, so the Omnia HD is more suited to competing pocket digicams instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia camcorder interface is identical to the one of the still camera and allows the user to choose between fixed and auto focus for the video. Effects are also available and a gridline can be applied to the viewfinder for easier framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recording time is not exactly limited, the real limit is imposed on the maximum file size for each recording. In this case videos don't get any bigger than 2GB. With 720p recording that means 30-40 minutes of footage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the sample videos we captured with the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD. We have uploaded the first four videos to Vimeo and YouTube, so you can check them out straight from your browser. The reason for this is that the YouTube encoding tends to preserve the quality of the videos, but reduces the frame rate, thus resulting in recordings that look choppier. Vimeo on the other hand keeps the good frame rate of the original video but compresses it more and so the quality degrades more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just don't forget to click the HD button for the YouTube videos once you start watching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video sample 1</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Follow this link for the Video sample 1 on Vimeo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video sample 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Follow this link for the Video sample 2 on Vimeo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video sample 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Follow this link for the Video sample 3 on Vimeo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video sample 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Follow this link for the Video sample 4 on Vimeo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is also an HD sample video that you can download and enjoy in its full shine, without any recompression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here go two samples in the lower D1 resolution, which you can also download and enjoy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample 1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some unknown reason the audio in those video clips is pretty bad, but we are pretty certain Samsung will take care of it before the handset hits the shelves (it was actually quite better on the earlier versions).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD did make an excellent first impression and the commitment to excellence is even stronger now so close to the market introduction. The handset successfully delivers on the promises of the spec sheet and has a few nice surprises in store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia skills are obviously in focus and the Omnia HD is clearly the standard setter here. Samsung have also done a great job of transforming the Symbian OS with their TouchWiz approach to touch handsets and adding a bunch of proprietary applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video fanatics seem to have no other option but to start saving as the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD sets to storm the shelves. One thing we know is this baby will hardly come cheap. Price is in fact the key question but we doubt budget will be an issue for those who want to get themselves a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is expected to head for the stores in the second half of this month and the price will probably be somewhere along the lines of 500 euro. Expensive it most definitely is, but it?s a high tech gadget that you can take wherever you go. You can easily buy yourselves an HD-recording DSLR digital camera for that kind of money, but you can hardly use that to make calls or surf the web.</paragraph>
