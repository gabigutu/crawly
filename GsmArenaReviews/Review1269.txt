			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a time honored tradition, we have the latest and greatest cameraphones lined up and ready to shoot for the top. It's been a while, we know. The last time we had a taste of 8MP sharpshooting action was in the distant 2008. 8MP then and 8MP now, but things cannot be more different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today we're looking at smartphones only. They excel at everything they do, but we focus on their imaging skills, in both stills and high-definition video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're looking for the best cameraphone among some of the industry's finest smartphones. This is not a battle of platforms and ideologies. This time around we're not interested in all-round skill and user experience. All the participants in this challenge are under strict instructions to shoot. And they will be shooting to kill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's meet our contenders. The brand new iPhone 4S seems to be the one to look out for, but the Samsung Galaxy S II has had a consistently excellent record so far. Then there's the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S and the latest HTC Sensation XE. The outstanding Nokia N9 and the Windows Phone heavyweight HTC Titan are also in the ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over time, we've developed various tests to assess the performance of each camera and we'll be using those to suss out the best 8MP sharpshooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality will also play a huge role in our judgment, but we have a sneaking suspicion that the still and video camera quality are linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the basics, we'll look at the features each phone offers. Then we move on to our series of image quality tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Four immensely different platforms are taking part in this shootout. There's iOS and MeeGo, and Windows Phone. We have three Androids modified by three different vendors. Parts of the functionality are similar, but there are some unique features too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we've got plenty of specs to explore, we thought one of our comparison tables might help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The table covers everything from the basics - resolution, scenes, custom settings (ISO, sharpness, etc.) - to things like starting the camera from the lockscreen. Not all of those are equally important to everyone. We can live without effects or we can add them later via a third-party app. We've thrown them in for good measure but they will not have a major impact on the ranking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The table gives the yes or no answers but doesn?t quite tell the whole story of the level of usability. Every phone has its quirks and highlights so we'll go over each of them quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S has the least amount of adjustable settings of all six ? basically, you can choose to enable geotagging, a viewfinder grid and touch focus. HDR mode and AE/AF lock are there though and are as good as unique among smartphones. So the 4S isn't actually as short of features as the simplistic UI might suggest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A double-click on the home key on the lockscreen gives you the option to launch the camera straight from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N9 doesn?t really have any toggles for setting up the shot in the viewfinder, but you see resolution, scene and flash mode indicators. The settings menu however is our favorite - it's simple to use with taps, easy to understand and offers a fair number of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II has the upper hand in the viewfinder, as you can choose 4 shortcuts to be easily accessible. The settings menu is rich with all kinds of options you can think of, but might be too complicated for the casual users as things go into submenus and aren?t all that well organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S also lets you choose which shortcuts are visible in the viewfinder and the settings menu is easy to pull out. It's a bit light on options though and the shutter key is uncomfortable. At least it?s there. Touch focus is enabled too, though it only works when the touch capture option is activated meaning every touch on the screen actually focuses and snaps the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE offers a number of basic shortcuts in the viewfinder and a fairly comprehensive list of settings. You can start the camera straight from the lockscreen thanks to the novel unlock routine in the latest HTC Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC?s other contender here, the HTC Titan, offers a good deal of options, but all of them are buried in the settings menu. The shutter key is very comfortable to use though and it will unlock the phone and launch the camera right out of the pocket (others can start the camera from a locked state but need you to wake the screen first).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cameras differ quite a bit in terms of user interface, each with its high and low points so we scored each one of them to make them easier to compare. We're also scoring the set of features each camera offers out of ten.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera startup and shot-to-shot time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the big conveniences of using your mobile phone as a camera is that's it's always with you. But what if the camera takes too long to start or between shots - you might miss the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also timed the cameras in cold and warm start scenarios and measured shot-to-shot time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S was generally the fastest - the 0.7s shot-to-shot time was the most impressive. The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S managed to get close with 0.9s shot-to-shot time (that's the time between second, third and so on shots) and it's warm start of 1.1s beat the iPhone's 1.4s. However, the arc S is quite slow when starting up the camera for the first time - the slowest of all six phones tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Macro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also did a quick test on the performance of each camera's macro mode - all cameras got as close as 7.5cm or less (that's 3 inches or less) and managed to get a focus lock. The Samsung Galaxy S II managed to get the closest, but the difference is an inch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also measured how much area each macro shot covers (i.e. the sides of a rectangle. All six phones have the exact same resolution, so the smaller the area, the more magnification you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite getting the closest, the Galaxy S II didn't offer the best magnification - that honor goes to the HTC Titan. The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S did worse here but the difference wasn't major - about 30%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that sometimes all the phones would report a lock when the image was clearly out of focus, so you need to be careful or some of your shots might not come out right. The problem usually occurs if you rely on the continuous autofocus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Fine-tuning a digital camera takes time and involves compromises. But if you want to be the best like our six competitors today, you can't afford to leave anything to chance when it comes to image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've literally spent days on end evaluating the performance of the phones in various conditions. We have scored a number of aspects of the image quality for each phone. We've prepared a batch of samples you can check out yourself, along with 100% crops to highlight our points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've posted full resolution shots for each phone later on in this article, but for convenience here are samples from each phone gathered into one place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Daylight performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here are the four crops we'll be using to test the daylight performance of each phone. You can find the full shots later on when we analyze each phone individually, but now let's see how they stack up against each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolved resolution. To evaluate the resolution, we have to see how much fine detail makes it in into the final shot. In Crop A you can look at the white lines at multiple angles, in Crop B check out the texture of the wall and in Crop C look at the numbers of the petrol station's price board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S resolves the white lines into thin, straight, sharp lines and keeps the most detail in the wall texture. It also presents the most readable numbers, making it the winner here with the Galaxy S II taking second place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N9 comes in last here along with the HTC Titan (broken up white lines in A, no texture in B, just noise and unreadable numbers in C).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise and noise reduction. Noise is readily apparent in areas of flat color and dark areas, which is why we'll be looking at Crop D. Do pay attention to the foliage and textures in the other crops though as noise can be removed, but at the expense of the fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, the Samsung Galaxy S II manages the least amount of noise without a big loss of detail - the sky is clear and the trees have leaves. The 4S comes in second with some luminance noise. The Sensation XE and Titan lose this round due to strong visible noise and smudged foliage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic range. Next up is Dynamic range ? that?s the amount of detail cameras capture in the lightest and darkest areas of the image in high-contrasty scenes. High contrasty scenes represent a significant challenge to cellphone cameras with extreme shadows and a really bright sources of light. With limited dynamic range comes the need for a compromise ? the cameras have to choose whether they should lose the the details in the highlights or those in the shadows without really knowing which ones are trhe most important to you. We?ve evaluated how the cameraphones in this test tackle that challenge and we particularly appreciated the balanced approach. Crop C is a nice example of the camera dynamic ranges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N9 shows the least amount of clipping in both the bright (mostly the white objects) and dark areas (virtually nothing). The iPhone 4S is second with some extra clipping on the sunlit walls. The Sensation XE loses a lot of detail in the shadows as well as in the highlights, where the rest do fine, which puts it firmly in last place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same crop we can judge how well each camera picked the most appropriate exposure. Where most phones tend to overexpose photos, the N9 is doing the best job. The 4S isn't far off either even though slight overexposure is evident on all of the samples we took with it. The arc S however, which consistently overexposes photos considerably, is the loser of this round.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendition. Finally, let's look at the color rendering. Crops A and C have big areas of the three primary colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Potentially, the main issues here are the warm color balance giving things a yellowish tinge and the oversaturating to make colors pop changing them quite a bit along the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S keeps things subtle (and closest to the truth). The colors come off cooler in the Galaxy S II photos but at least they aren?t oversaturated. The S II shares the second place with the N9, which produces photos with a slight tint to them too (a warm tint in this occasion). The other three are equally flawed so it's a three-way tie at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summary. Here are the scores we awarded each phone in the various categories for daylight performance. Not all weigh the same (some might prefer better dynamic range over color accuracy), so simply adding the numbers up doesn?t give you a definitive answer or a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S emerged as the overall winner - while it didn't ace all categories, when you take everything into account its photos were the best. Others beat out the 4S in some areas but none mustered enough quality to top it as a whole.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Low light performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Flash off. Let's evaluate the camera performance in poor lighting conditions with flash turned off first (Crop E). Their flashes differ in output, which will make comparing low-light shots hard if we don?t know how each sensor performs under the same lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crop gives only a limited view of the whole scene, so here are the full shots from all six phones if you want to have a close look at them as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II and Nokia N9 are practically tie here with detailed, noise-free shots. The Xperia arc S does pretty well too, but leaves traces of color noise. The Sensation XE produces very noisy shots in the dark but keeps a lot of detail too. Still, its Titan sibling beats it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash on. Next, let's look at the flash performance - the subject is relatively close and the only source of light is the LED flash. That's Crop F.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the combination of flash/sensor of the Galaxy S II produces the best results with a usable noise-free shot (but with green tint in the shadows). The iPhone 4S has a weaker flash but there's a lot of detail and no tinting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE struggled with the noise (including color noise) but it has a strong dual-LED flash and spot on colors. The N9 has a poor flash performance and failed to lit up the whole scene evenly despite its dual LED module. Its flash images also come up with lots of noise and a distinct color tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan had a very strong flash but tinted the whole photos and left color noise. The arc S had great colors (and no tint) but also some color noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you a better look, here are the full resolution shots used to make the Crop F.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summary. Time to summarize low-light performance. Here are the scores we awarded each phone for its performance in both flash off and flash on scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Results here are almost too close to call - still, we're willing to rule in favor of the Galaxy S II as a whole but it's very hard to separate it from the 4S in this test. The Sensation XE managed to redeem itself somewhat after its poor performance in the good light test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Individual perfomance summary<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPhone 4S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S leaves noticeable luminance noise in photos, but it also renders impressive amounts of fine detail - more than any other phone in the shootout. The camera consistently overexposes highlights though, which reduces the detail there but the shadows come out very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are tack sharp, with accurate colors and very little in the way of artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark, the 4S photos turned out with some visible noise but a good amount of detail too. The color rendering was very good but the LED flash performance was unimpressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the Apple iPhone 4S camera samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N9 impresses with spot-on exposure and superior dynamic range ? it?s the best of the bunch in this respect. Its images come out grainy but there?s no color noise. At 100% magnification though, it?s evident it doesn?t excel in resolved fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Daylight photos are free of artifacts and with accurate colors (barring a slight saturation boost).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos in poor lighting have fairly low amounts of noise and decent detail, but they have an omnipresent color tint. The LED flash on this one is also pretty weak comparing to the rest even though it's a Dual LED unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the Nokia N9 camera samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II is good at eliminating color noise from photos but leaves in a little grain and a lot of fine detail. Images look sharp and with modest amounts of clipping in the highlights and shadows. White balance aims for neutral, but ends up on the side of cooler hues. Other than that, colors are accurate. There's a trace of oversharpening but that's it for image artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark, the S II kept noise in check but the amount of captured detail and contrast could have been better. Also, there's a slight tint in the shadows. The single-LED flash's performance was average but the camera produces almost noise-free shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the Samsung Galaxy S II camera samples:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Individual performance summary<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Arc S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Arc S chose not to fight noise too much, which left some visible noise in the photos (especially in darker areas), but fine detail is preserved. Highlights are consistently overexposed so detail is lost there, but detail in shadows gets to stay (but there's noise there too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos have a tinge of yellow to them (consumers typically prefer warmer colors). Colors are oversaturated and we saw a faint pink spot in the center of some photos. Also, there's noticeable blue fringing in high-contrast borders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark, there's a decent amount of detail captured but contrast is low and there's noticeable color noise. Its LED flash is average in performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S camera samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sensation XE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos from the HTC Sensation XE are pretty noisy. The camera's dynamic range is limited, which means it loses detail in both shadows and highlights. The camera chooses the best exposure for its capabilities but that isn't much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>White balance trended towards yellow. On top of that, saturation is pushed a bit too high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XE turned in the noisiest photos in the dark when using the flash (which is the strongest of the six), which killed a lot of the detail. Shots in slightly better lighting without flash were surprisingly good though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Titan</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan has a wider angle lens that its competitors, which gives it an edge in landscape shots, at the price of lower fine detail and more lens distortion when you get up close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise reduction is too aggressive, giving photos that dreaded watercolor painting look. Fine detail is smeared over but even then, there's still some color noise visible. The Titan finds a better balance between the clipping of the highlights and shadows than most but it suffers from the same yellowish oversaturated colors as the XE. There was a noticeable pink spot to most of the samples too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos in the dark with the Titan were noisy with decent detail. The flash was strong but but there's a tint affecting the whole photo. Other than that low-light shots are pretty usable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With video becoming extremely easy to share over the Internet, the popularity of video recording on mobile phones has grown immensely. So much so that not having HD capture on most recent smartphones is considered a downside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all HD video is the same though - of the six phones we're testing, half shoot FullHD (each frame has 2 megapixels resolution, to put a number to it) and the other half makes do with 720p (~0.9MP).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s more, video resolution doesn?t tell the whole story about the quality of the footage. The field of view, the compression, the choice of codec, the auto focus modes and color rendition all take their tall and can easily make or break it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To gauge the video recording capabilities of the six contenders, we analyzed individual frame quality in various aspects, the smooth playback and sound. We've prepared some crops from our shooters separated into two categories - 1080p and 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p camcorders that have an option to record 720p were judged in both modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different phones showed different strengths so the equal feature scores don't mean the phones have the same feature set. The HTC Titan had the most comfortable shutter key, which really helped its score. However, the iPhone 4S' native video stabilization works really well (but a volume control key is no substitute for a proper shutter key). The arc S did well too with an assortment of features and a hardware shutter key (which we really wish was more comfortable).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video performance in good light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Resolution in good light. First up, we're looking at the resolution in well-lit videos. Here the iPhone 4S has a solid lead with the Galaxy S II and Sensation XE sharing the second place. The 1080p videos from the two Android phones look softer than the 4S videos. The Nokia N9 loses quite badly here with a lot of lost detail and the XE in 720p mode isn't much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some crops to illustrate what we're talking about:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendition in good light. As far as colors go, things were pretty close. Weirdly, the Galaxy S II uses a different color balance for 720p shots - one that looks much better than the one used in its 1080p mode. The Sensation XE also changed the white balance when going down to 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise and noise reduction in good light. Looking into how each phone handles noise, we judged the balance - keeping noise out, but without losing too much detail at its expense. The iPhone 4S did best here as did the Galaxy S II in 720p mode (that's pixel binning technology in action). The arc S left a good deal of color noise and loses this round.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Framerate and bitrate. We also looked into the frame rate and bitrate of each video - with sufficient light, all but the Nokia N9 hit their 30fps targets. The Nokia N9 does something weird, which we'll discuss later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S uses much higher bitrate than the rest (which is, in part, what makes its videos so good) but we wish it had a 720p option - memory fills up quickly with such a high bitrate. The Galaxy S II in 720p uses slightly higher bitrate than the Sensation XE in 1080p, which allows it to score the same in the resolution section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summary.  Finally, here's a table that gives scores from 1 to 10 in each category for the six contenders:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S came this close to a perfect 10 with the Galaxy S II trailing by some distance. A place where the S II lost points was color balance, which oddly improved in 720p, which was enough for it to win the 720p contest. As for 720p-only phones, the HTC Titan takes the top spot. The N9 lost points in the smoothness category as its videos hit only 24fps (that number went up when we switched off the lights, more on that in the next section).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Low light video performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Resolution. Moving on to low light performance, the iPhone 4S again gets the highest marks in terms of resolution by quite a margin. The Galaxy S II holds on to second place when shooting in 1080p and the N9 comes in last (again).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual here are the crops to illustrate our findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering. The Galaxy S II does better in 720p for color rendering and in the dark does even better than the 4S. Others, except the Titan, were close behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise and noise reduction. The lower resolution also changes the situation when it comes to noise reduction and the S II in 720p matched the 4S in this department as noise reduction without any reduction of reso0lved detail is a key advantage of the pixel binning technology. The Nokia N9 and arc S did very poorly in terms of noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Framerate and bitrate. With less light available, the framerate fell for most phones. The Sensation XE was hit the hardest dropping below the 24fps threshold. It startled us when the Nokia N9 actually upped the framerate to 29fps - we also looked into different lighting situations and it seems that the darker the frame, the closer the framerate to 30fps. We suspect it has something to do with the amount of detail it has to process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summary. To wrap things off, here?s a summarized scoring table with what we thought each smartphone deserves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even with the lights off, the iPhone 4S snatched first place with the Galaxy S II trailing again. It takes the consolation prize of being the top 720p shooter in the dark overall, but among the 720p-only phones the Titan (again) takes the top spot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Individual video performance analysis<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPhone 4S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S has a stunning amount of detail in its videos - it beats the other five hands-down. The level of detail comes at a price though, and that's storage. A short 20 second video weighs in at nearly 60MB and you can't choose 720p to save space either. A long 10 minute video grows to 1.7-1.8GB - owners 4S with 16GB will have to offload their videos quite often if they want room for other stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even in the dark, videos have a lot of detail but there's noticeable noise. Still, it's the best performer in poor lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AE/AF lock and video stabilization make things even more certain - if you want the best FullHD video on the market now, the iPhone 4S is the one to get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing that lets it down is the audio - it's mono sound recorded at 64Kbps (AAC). Also, in video mode its field of view of 40mm is quite less than the 30mm wide angle FoV of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a FullHD video sample that shows the video recording skill of the iPhone 4S in both good and low light. Don't forget to choose 1080p and view it in full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N9 is one of the 720p shooters and videos have very poor detail. Low contrast areas show signs of too much compression. Videos can be a bit choppy depending on the situation (not quite hitting the 30fps mark, closer to 25-27fps) and there's a hint of excessive rolling shutter effect too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Highlights and shadows are properly exposed. Color saturation is boosted a bit and white balance is off (towards cooler hues).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the camera's wide aperture, low-light videos come off pretty noisy and with noticeable motion blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have stereo sound with a bitrate of 132Kbps (AAC).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can watch the following video - it shows the N9 recording video in both good and low light (best viewed in full screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II captures good amounts of fine detail across the whole frame. White balance produces cool colors, just like the still camera. Other than that, colors are mostly OK and there are no complaints about the video quality. By the way, colors are much, much better if you switch to 720p mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark, noise kills a lot of the detail but videos are still nice. Framerate for FullHD videos drops to 25fps in low light situations, but 720p videos remain at a solid 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio is mono at 60Kbps (AAC).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's Galaxy S II's video sample - don't forget to select 1080p resolution and view it in full screen. Click here to view the 720p sample of the same scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arc S shoots 720p videos and the level of fine detail is mostly good. We say mostly, as the compression is heavier than it should have been and that results in softness in some areas. Videos don't quite hit their intended 30fps mark when there isn't enough light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlit sensor fails to keep noise at bay when the lights go out and there's not much fine detail left in the videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured with 128Kbps stereo sound (AAC codec is used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the video sample for the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S (best viewed in full screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sensation XE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos from the Sensation XE have a lot of detail in them, but compression artifacts manage to kill the detail in the low-contrast areas. The motion blur is more noticeable than on most of the other competitors. Colors are oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In poor lighting conditions, quality drops noticeably - as does the framerate. Both 1080p and 720p are below the 24fps limit in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have stereo audio with 128Kbps bitrate (AAC).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget to click 1080p when viewing Sensation XE's video sample (and it's best to watch it in full screen). You can view the 720p sample here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Titan</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan videos have very good detail for the 720p mark, but again heavy compression kicks in to smudge things out in some areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Results in the dark are quite alright - noise is kept in check and the amount of captured detail is surprisingly close to that in well-lit videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan's videos have stereo sound too (AAC codec is used again).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's Titan's video sample - hit full screen for a more detailed look.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been almost exactly 3 years since our first 8MP shootout and, oh, how things have changed. 8MP cameraphones offer stunning image quality and HD video is an important part of the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We crunched a lot of data into tables and shared our thoughts on how each phone performed in each individual category. But now it's time to put all of that together and bring the jury in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that we're judging the six phones by their cameras alone and nothing else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to recommend a cameraphone, it would be the iPhone 4S. The still camera was either the best or a close second in each category we tested. Also, it stole the show when it came to video recording. It goes to show that when Apple put their hearts to it, they can quickly climb to the top (and it was a steep climb too, if you remember the cameras on the early iPhones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a typical Apple fashion, the 4S focused on being perfect and wouldn't care for anything less - things like 720p or lower quality setting for stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, the things that were included are highly desirable - native HDR mode, AE/AF lock and video stabilization can certainly make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II is the runner up when it comes to overall performance - its still camera and camcorder beat the others most of the time. It used to be the standard-setter for 8MP/1080p mobile cameras but after 8 long (in tech terms) months on the market, it's time to cede that title.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Talking of surprises, they don't usually get any bigger than an iPhone coming out top in a cameraphone challenge. It's been a long way for Apple but they obviously had time to catch up. They've been lucky in a way - time is a luxury in this industry.</paragraph>

Video recording has caught up with still photography, smartphones and tablets have changed the landscape beyond recognition.
