			<paragraph>Cutting edge, sleek and promising, the iPhone stirred the mobile world - not bad for Apple's first go at the mobile phones market. Inspiring and provocative, the iPhone will always come to mind when a handset with full touch-based user interface is in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, since the official release of the iPhone on 29th June 2007, a lot of reviews came out, too many controversial things were said, and there we are - finally having our say about the handset. As wise people say, better later than never.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple is a company which specializes in developing products on the verge of science fiction. The iPod is a perfect example. Around 2001 the company decided to change portable music players as we know them, and pretty much succeeded. Much like the iPhone, the announcement of iPod generated huge amounts of hype and when it came out in October 2001 it actually lived up to almost every promise, turning out to be a total smash. As it developed, throughout the years, Apple's portable music player became the most popular mobile multimedia device and its reputation never seems to fade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following the same credo of being a feature-rich, yet simple-to-use device, the iPhone will undoubtedly build a strong fan base. It will surely attract the many "if-it-ain't-shinin'-I-ain't-buyin'" customers, since the iPhone is definitely among the most beautifully crafted mobile phones we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will be a while before we get a hands-on with the European version of the iPhone. As Apple has confirmed the device is due to hit the European market November 9th 2007 starting with UK and Germany and later on this month in France. The craved device already appeared throughout retailers in Europe ss unlocking efforts so far are managing to overcome the protection of the handset.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>      Apple iPhone 360-degree spin - hover your mouse cursor over the image</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Looks matter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You've probably already seen pictures and videos of Apple's iPhone but in reality the handset is smaller than you might have expected. It measures 115 x 61 x 12 mm, which is a normal smartphone size, only a little wider and a lot slimmer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is actually a bit weighty at 145g, but, again, compare it to a 30 or 80GB iPod and you'll find that the iPhone weighs pretty much the same. Plus, precisely the size gives you the opportunity to enjoy the gorgeous 3.5" TFT display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually almost the whole front panel is the display itself. You'll only see the earpiece above it and the Home key below. Other than that - it's all flat! Nothing sticks out. That smooth combination of flat surface and the sleek chrome framing surrounding the glass face of the iPhone is to us the most appealing aspect of the appearance of the phone. It kind of looks like everything has been thought through and all you need is on the inside of the phone - not on the surface. By the way, the glass and the metal framing should be scratchproof, but seriously, we don't have the nerve to test that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is also metal-covered and has the reflective Apple logo in the middle, a slightly recessed 2 megapixel camera lens and the general product information about the phone (IMEI, serial, etc.). It's not like this information is vital, but it kind of tells you it's a cool gadget you're holding in your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side are the volume rocker and the mute key - this dedicated key is a pleasing feature actually. On the right is the 3.5 mm headphones jack, but don't get your hopes too high for plugging your favorite headphones in just like that. The plug is strangely recessed and hardly any standard jacks will fit in. However you can buy yourself an adaptor - either third-party one or a set from Apple themselves. On the top of the iPhone is the SIM card tray (yes, the SIM is removable) and the sleep/wake button. In order to open the tray you have to stick a paper clip (not included!) into the little pinhole and the tray just pops up. That's basically it as regards the outside of the phone. Didn't we tell you - it's as smooth as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole geometry of the iPhone makes it pretty comfortable to hold. It fits in the palm nicely and, even when in portrait mode, it can be operated with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, the handset is a bit wider than usual but its slimness makes up for that. The iPhone will fit almost perfectly even in the tightest pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same time, it's exactly the smooth shape that makes the phone a bit slippery and if you are not so handy there is a serious risk of dropping the iPhone? often. That would be a shame, because this baby is definitely not made for hitting the floor, although Apple claims the metal casing should be strong enough to take a hit, but we wouldn't recommend relying on that. Keep it safe!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping it safe inevitably leads us to keeping it clean. Due to the iPhone's glossy finish the whole front surface is a real fingerprint magnet. And since the finger navigation is your only option, the screen becomes smudgy after just a few flicks or taps, which leaves you with a part time job as an iPhone cleaner. And note that since the touch screen only responds to fingertip touch, you won't be able to control it wearing gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of battery life the iPhone is pretty solid and, as numerous test posted online claim, the announced 8 hours talk time is actually a credible figure you can pretty much rely on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone also has a loudspeaker. It's a single mono speaker, but still better than nothing and it actually makes it the first iPod with a built-in speaker.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display goes a long way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you clearly imagine by now, the display is the best and most important part of the iPhone. Given the lack of a physical keyboard, the 16M color TFT display is basically everything you've got to control the handset. First of all it's very attractive and bright. Secondly, it measures good 3.5", running at 480 x 320 pixels resolution - a feat that is rarely surpassed (Check out the Toshiba G900 PocketPC, which boasts a 3" display with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels). And third? one should just see for themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way the pixel count isn't always decisive of what you get. More vital is how the phone is using the screen's real-estate. Compared to other mobile devices with high resolution displays, running on Windows Mobile, which are showing the text in microscopic size, the iPhone serves you a smooth, easy readable font size. Trust us, with the cool browsing opportunities and given the big amount of text flowing trough the display while reading web pages or e-mails, you'll quickly appreciate the excellent viewing experience that the iPhone offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visibility under direct sunlight has what it takes to impress. In outdoor conditions the display remains completely readable and maybe just the viewing angle leaves a little something to be desired. It's probably the best display we've seen upsofar when it comes to legibility under direct sunlight - it even beats our all-time favorite Nokia smartphone displays.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sensing the difference<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Talking about the iPhone features, we must not forget the sensors that Apple have put into the handset. First - the light sensor. Its main purpose is to save power by adjusting the screen's brightness to the surrounding lightning conditions. It does its job, but because it's automatic it may sometimes irritate you by being slightly inadequate. However you have the option for turning that sensor off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the orientation sensor works like a charm and comes very handy. As soon as you rotate the iPhone form portrait to landscape, the screen flips accordingly. This allows quickly changing the way a picture is taken/shown, or a web page is displayed. It also provides you with a nice widescreen layout when viewing videos. The correct angle when holding it is crucial to the performance of the sensor - it won't rotate you screen if you hold the device parallel to the ground - you have to get the right angle. Unfortunately only selected parts of the interface can be rotated that way - too few according to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And last, but not least, the proximity sensor. Since the iPhone is completely touch controlled there is always the possibility of touching the screen with your cheek (in the middle of a call that is) and switching something on or off. The proximity sensor automatically switches off the display as soon as you raise the phone to your ear. It's really snappy and works seamlessly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mac OS goes mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, this is where the fun starts. The whole UI is actually very simple, consistent and intuitive. You can access all the functions with just a few taps. First of all the speed is incredible - no lags, no hanging, simply marvelous. Plus, now you get to use the revolutionary gesture-based (or multi-touch) control system. Well, it's needless to say that it'll take some time for you to get used to it, but once you master it, which shouldn't take that long, you'll find it very entertaining.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every action of the iPhone is performed with some sort of eye-candy animation - everything is animated in some way. Things don't just pop up; they slide in with a swoosh. It looks great and it doesn't get in your way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to give you full control and navigation opportunities, Apple has assembled an interesting set of gestures to use. And you won't find anything new about the function itself, but about the way you experience it. The iPhone offers a great time with its touch-controlled interface and even the most boring function turns out to be fun. So with this list posted you're probably beginning to feel a bit scared of all the new things. We recommend watching this video to get the whole touch-control picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to touch navigation, the iPhone offers probably the most intuitive and user-friendly interface interaction we've seen so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual keypad of the iPhone is definitely a mediocre performer. Its main flaw is the lack of any tactile feedback when you touch a key - a quick vibration for every key press would have come in handy (haptics they call it). For a virtual keyboard, it's actually ok. It does fine, although it is of course slower than a hardware one and a lot of mistakes are easily made, but you know - practice makes perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple developers have added a type-assistant, which auto-completes your words, if they are in the dictionary (you can add more words to it in the process) and highlights the next possible letter you'd type in, drawing the assumptions from its built-in database. Sometimes it really helps, sometimes it's rather irritating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something of an unexplainable drawback is that in landscape mode the keyboard is a lot wider, the buttons are bigger and more convenient, but you can only use the horizontal layout when typing in Safari while browsing. What's up with that? We really wish Apple would enable horizontal input in all of the iPhone applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now with the user interaction all covered, it's worth saying a few words about the UI looks. Unfortunately, Apple gave us almost no chance to personalize the iPhone. We've got practically no view customization options. There are preset themes for the different applications, which are nice of course, but having some personalized visual styling available wouldn't have hurt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, you can only change the incoming calls ringtone; the messaging alerts and almost any other types of alerts are fixed. You can't even use your own ringtones; you must select from what Apple gives you by default - most of which are pretty quiet even at maximum volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone home screen contents are pretty much all you need to access all the features the handset is loaded with. All the icons lead to particular functions, and you can return to the home screen (actually called springboard) by pressing the Home button. The four icons in the bottom of the screen represent the iPhone main functionalities (as Apple see it): phone, mail, web browser, and music and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OS doesn't have a Task Manager for managing the currently running programs. Returning to the Home screen in the middle of something doesn't "quit" or "close" the current application. Instead, it continues running and doing its job until you return to it later.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hallo, hallo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is nothing special. You have the onscreen dial pad, and a convenient Recent section, which keeps track of all the calls made, received and missed. As far as the common user is concerned, the iPhone has a pretty good reception and the voice quality is just above average. However the loudspeaker performance is not so impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your contacts are organized in the traditional phonebook and the Favorites list, which is a reinvented speed dial. It stores the most accessed contacts into one list. You can also synchronize your contacts with your Mac or PC using iTunes. Unfortunately, the iPhone phonebook doesn't allow letter-by-letter searching of your contacts. You have to scroll to find the contact you need, and in some serious cases where you have more than 500 contacts, it turns out to be a challange finding the single one you need to call. This search however is available when you are sending messgaes so why they left it out of the phonebook is a real mystery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hitting the message express<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS application is uncomplicated and it organizes your messages nicely. It divides them into threads on both sides of the screen - inbox on the left and sent items on the right. SMS messages are sorted in a distinctive "bubble conversation" pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An unexplainable drawback is the lack of MMS, and that's not the only thing missing in this section. Another one is that you cannot send a message to multiple recipients. Also there's no Drafts folder - if someone happens to call you while you are typing a message, it's gone for good. There's no message delivery reports either - a feature which is otherwise old as the GSM mobile phones themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mail client of the iPhone is of course very good. Setup is very straightforward and we'd say that the whole application works well. It supports POP and IMAP accounts plus presets for Yahoo, Gmail, Mac and AOL mail. The Exchange mail server support is a bit dodgy and works with IMAP only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mail client is a nice application, but it does have its flaws, especially when it comes to message managing. It doesn't offer any spam filtering and you cannot delete multiple e-mails, as well as there is no way to mark multiple emails as read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Push email is not supported, but you have the option to set the iPhone to check for new messages at configurable periods of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the iPhone doesn't have cut/copy/paste features, which always come in handy when working with emails and general messaging.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPoding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPod application is very easy to use and really entertaining. Browsing tracks is made incredibly easy and it's a shame the iPhone doesn't let you create your own playlists. It is of course doable, but only on your personal computer, which is sort of inconvenient. There are also On-The-Go playlists, but sadly enough as the name suggests they can't be saved. Audio quality is crystal clear. If you like iPod, you'll most definitely enjoy the iPod application and the whole iPhone in general.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally here comes the Album view. It's actually called CoverFlow, and switching it on is as simple as rotating the iPhone to landscape orientation. It's the ultimate eye pleaser. We are not going to try and explain it in writing. We won't get even close to describing the feeling you get when you actually use it. So, if you still haven't held an iPhone, take a look at this video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing videos with it is just amazing. You'll always be satisfied with the size and quality of the picture. The widescreen high-resolution display makes watching videos a pretty pleasant experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera: 2 megapixel, 0 frills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone camera is simple and? well, simple. The built-in 2 megapixel camera is ok for indoor pictures with good lightning and no need of manual settings, but if you have to adjust the picture mode a little for something special: oops - there are no settings! Yes Apple decided to strip the camera menu completely. So if you're keen on high quality cameras, with all possible adjustment possibilities, consider this drawback before you make up your mind about your next purchase. But in general, these auto-adjusted "point and shoot" pictures come out nice and in comparison to other 2 megapixel phone cameras the iPhone actually does just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Should you decide to email a picture however, the image gets automatically resized in half the original resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. An utterly disappointing solution, we should add, and there is no way of changing that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the iPhone is unable to record video. If you're getting your hopes on shooting your own videos with your iPhone and then uploading them to YouTube, just like you've always dreamt of, forget about it! Now Apple should have got that one straight - if it wants to be a full-fledged multimedia device, iPhone can't afford to compromise video recording capabilities.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sync me in<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone supports Wi-Fi 802.11b/g, USB v2.0 and of course Bluetooth v2.0. The Bluetooth functionality doesn't include the A2DP profile for listening music on stereo headphones and, what is more, it can only be used to connect to a wireless headset. That's odd! It means that you cannot, by any means, exchange data with other Bluetooth enabled devices. This is a decision beyond our understanding, given the huge popularity of Bluetooth file transferring nowadays. Maybe Apple are trying to tell the world something and we're sure they have serious reasons for such a decision, but we would like to know what they are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes interface for syncing the iPhone is much like the one for iPod, but comes with more options. Also much like an iPod, the iPhone appears as a removable drive on the computer and can be used as a mass storage device - the files you upload however will not be accessible from within the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Safari web browser is probably the best mobile browser we've seen on a mobile phone. First of all, it's fast and pages look very nice in landscape mode. You can zoom by just double tapping on a picture or a text column and then pan with your finger to navigate the page. Double tapping on an already zoomed object zooms out and shows you the whole page in full size. By the way, full-size pages reveal their whole layout but the text and pictures are microscopic. The aforementioned double tapping however is enough to get a detailed look at the desired section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can open multiple windows simultaneously and switch between them by flicking the respective tab shown on the left or the right of the main window. The bookmarks the Safari browser offers can be synchronized with your Mac or PC. So far so good, you'll say, but strangely enough the iPhone Safari browser doesn't support Flash or Java (not to be confused with JavaScript). No comment - it's just another odd surprise. Our overall impression of the Safari web browser is superb - it left us delighted since it provided the easiest web browsing experience we've seen to date.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your mobile Dashboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So what does the iPhone offer in terms of additional applications? Actually a pretty common set of functions plus iTunes, iPod, and the, no longer unique, YouTube client. You also have Weather, Stocks, Maps and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The personal data management applications include the Calculator, which is nothing special, as well as the slightly more elaborate Clock. It includes World Clock, Alarm, Stopwatch and Timer, which are all very effective and easy to use. The World Clock, as you can imagine, allows you to track the time in multiple time zones, the Stopwatch is a regular one, with a lap function, and the Alarm can be set to multiple, user-defined alarm times. The Calendar is a reliable application with solid performance. It has great layout and interface and makes good use of the screen real estate and you can synchronize it with your personal computer through iTunes. Some people may find the Notes application useful, others not, but in general this feature is pretty much OK. You can write notes, with a cool handwriting-like style, on what appears to be a yellow notepad. Text input with the virtual keyboard is a pickle though. Unfortunately, those notes don't get synchronized via iTunes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube client allows users to browse a special version of the YouTube website and watch the videos there. Since the iPhone does not support Flash video, all video clips are re-encoded from Flash to H.264 video for streaming. However, the YouTube application allows you to fully appreciate the supreme video quality which the iPhone offers. Really, the quality is simply outstanding, so don't hesitate to try it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps application features real maps provided by Google. The iPhone doesn't have a built-in GPS receiver, but the Maps are actually pretty accurate and can show you the desired route between user-defined points with turn-by-turn directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application even allows searching for places of interest or other notable places in your vicinity - for example you can use it to find a nearby museum and then have a sushi snack in one of the listed Japanese joints locally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore Maps allows you to plan travel routes by giving you detailed information about traffic and even plans all the available routes for you to choose. The ones marked with green are usually the better ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application lets you track the movement of your preferred stocks on the market, while the Weather is an application that shows you the weather in all of your favorite cities divided in tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Technically, the iPhone has support for Word, Excel, and PDF documents but only in read-only mode. And the only way to transfer documents to the iPhone is mailing them to yourself. The iPhone doesn't have an IM application either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for native third-party applications, there is no official support for them. As Steve Jobs, the Apple CEO announced, a SDK will be freely available somewhere around February 2007. For now developers are welcomed to work on web-based applications and games (no Flash or Java, remember!). It seems however that Apple doesn't have the final word on that matter though. As it turned out the unlocked iPhones that have been spreading like a wild fire also allow installing third-party native applications too. And the mobile community is wasting no time and is developing new applications at a fast pace.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So let's sum it up. The iPhone doesn't claim to be the best phone ever. It's above average, but it has a long list of drawbacks. It's not a business phone either, so don't confuse it with one. And it's most definitely the best iPod ever. However we find that the description that suites the iPhone best is "a dedicated entertainment multimedia mobile device". If you're keen on browsing, listening to music and consuming multimedia content, this handset is, without a doubt, the top performer in its class. Every process is maximum simplified and as fun as possible. It almost feels like a game. And it's a pretty darn good one, too. Well, time to say goodbye to this much-coveted device - we are looking forward to seeing it hit the European market in the end of the 2007.</paragraph>
