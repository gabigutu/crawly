			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages of iPhone 3GS (OS disadvantages not counted here):<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new iPhone 3GS lacks the same novelty factor as its predecessors - the lack of design changes is a turn-down</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3 megapixel camera with limited feature set hardly cuts it for a high-end device</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's still no flash or hardware shutter key for the camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the upgrade, battery life is still generally poor (2-year old iPhone 2G are still doing way better)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No videocalls functionality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No FM radio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No stereo speakers (or are we pushing it too far already?)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 3GS is probably not the next revolutionary iPhone as you might have expected it. But the performance boost, the sharper camera with video and the purportedly improved battery life certainly make of the current iPhone (3GS or whatever it is called this year) a much more balanced smartphone, one that you could probably wave in front your geeky friends more proudly. Well, you'd still get the chilling disapproving look, but at least you won't feel as embarrassed as you used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth about the iPhone is this - perhaps about 20 million people around the globe are quoted as having given in to the iPhone temptation ever since the frenzy started. Now, 2 years later, the rest of the modern world is already sick to death of hearing all about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once ground-breaking, but still as controversial and inspiring as ever, the iPhone lineup has just received its latest offspring. Meet the iPhone 3GS, where "S" can mean a lot of things, but without a doubt covers all that's needed for "Speed".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using last year's design but boasting some extra powerful hardware, the iPhone 3GS is supposed to, and indeed is, running up to 2 times better than what Apple have offered us so far. This speed boost doesn't bring substantial new capabilities to the table. Instead it's more like the hardware catching up with what we can still call one of the most advanced and user-friendly touch user interfaces to-date (in the realm of GSM mobile phones, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the iPhone 3GS and the 3G are most obviously cut from the same cloth, you'd be glad to know that there are some differentiating factors that can perhaps be worth your cash:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPhone 3GS advantages over iPhone 3G:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the iPhone 3GS is the first iPhone to come with the iPhone OS 3.0 factory preinstalled, we'll most definitely have a detailed look in this review at the changes it brings about - no matter that iPhone 2G and 3G have both received the update for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where it stands today, the iPhone OS 3.0 is much more mature version of itself back in the day. Honestly, when we look at where it's at now, we can only be amazed how limited in features it was when it all started a couple of years ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's a lot to cover today, so let's not waste any more time. Join us as we go through the well known hardware and design and bear with us as we cover the iPhone OS 3.0, because it will get interesting, we promise.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the iPhone 3GS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple continues to use the same boxes for the iPhone 3GS. At least, it says 3GS on the box - a sign that is not to be found on the iPhone itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contents of the box are pretty standard issue stuff - a USB cable, a charger that uses this very cable to charge the phone and a pair of headphones. You also get some Apple stickers to proudly advertize your loyalty to the brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no docking desk stand again (it was there with the iPhone 2G) and there's no cleaning cloth (it was there on both the iPhone 2G and 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple have supplied the iPhone 3GS with a new set of headphones - this time there's remote function for controlling the music playback and voice control. Except for the new three-key remote, the headset looks exactly as the previous models and can only be described as "basic" - both in looks and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might be misled by the looks of the remote as it only has three keys and they seem to be assigned to different functions. But the remote has its tricks and once you learn them, you'd controlling your music as easy as pie. On the other hand, a remote that comes with a manual cannot be called user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the top and bottom keys control the volume. The central key is where the magic happens. One click during music playback plays/pauses music, two clicks start fast forwarding, three clicks activate rewinding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same time, a click during an incoming call accepts the call and in almost every situation clicking and holding briefly triggers new Voice Command feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 3GS 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 3GS looks just the same as the iPhone 3G, but you knew that, right? The shell has remained the same so there are no changes in the dimensions whatsoever. The iPhone 3GS has put on some weight though, but it's just 2-3g we're talking about here, so it's not a big deal. Alright, let's get the thing spinning now, shall we?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Describing the iPhone 3GS is no-brainer. Hey, you've seen the iPhone 3G already, right? Well, it's just the same. And we mean THE SAME. Finding a visible difference between the two is quite a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only difference we could find is a really subtle one - the fine-print text on the back of the 3GS (including the "iPhone" sign) has chrome finish now instead of the grey ink used on the iPhone 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And unfortunately, much to our disappointment, there's no sign of any "3GS" branding - so it would be hard for you to really show off with your new Apple handset ('cause it's just the same as the old one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the iPhone 3GS is again the same industry-leading stuff as last generations. It's got great viewing angles, excellent colors and most of all, yet unsurpassed among GSM handsets sunlight visibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display has a resolution of 320 x 480 pixels. While that resolution seemed hot two years ago when the first iPhone was launched, year 2009 saw WVGA resolution screens becoming more common in the upper market segment and they are already found on a number of non-smartphone devices by competing brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess however that changing the screen resolution along the way would mean compatibility issues with many AppStore applications. So there might be a point in keeping the same display unit for future phones, but still the geek squad will most probably object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 3GS however has a changed white balance much like the 3G had it changed as compared to the 2G. It's kinda geeky to make a point of it, but we couldn't help ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 3GS has a slightly warmer representation of the colors as compared to the 3G and that's a good thing since the 3G had it way too cool and even bluish (check out the last photo). But that difference is obvious only when you compare the devices head-to-head. When you have them on their own, chances are you'd never notice it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple claim to have laid a special oleophobic coating on the screen glass, which simply means cleaning those smudges should be easier than before. And indeed it is. You see, the difference is nothing ground-breaking, but it's still there. Where several good scrubs with the cleaning cloth were needed on the 3G, now only a quick T-shirt rub will do for the iPhone 3GS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the iPhone 3GS could have made a good use of a camera shutter key - we're dying for one, especially now when there's auto focus. Yes, we know the camera works with touch focus making the old focus-and-recompose technique a thing of the past, but still touching on a feedback-less screen to take photos is not our thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now as you may have guessed it, the top of the iPhone 3GS has seen no changes at all. The awkward SIM card slot, the 3.5mm audio jack, and the On/Off key - they are all here, conveniently placed to make you at home with the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is where the mic and the loudspeaker is situated. The loudspeaker is a single one unfortunately, which is a shame, we would have enjoyed stereo speakers on the 3GS. The particular location of the loudspeaker is the very same reason we prefer landscape AppStore games to be rotated the opposite way (with the loudspeaker on the right instead left). Otherwise, your fingers holding the iPhone muffle the loudspeaker unless you go the extra length of putting it out of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news however is Apple have finally tuned the loudspeaker performance, and yes, it's noticeably louder than before. Not that it's a great achievement, as the previous iPhone bottomed out our comparative loudspeaker tables, but it's a really nice upgrade. The loudness level is now pretty much acceptable, but you'll have the chance of checking out the test results in the Telephony part of this iPhone 3GS review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the iPhone 3GS is the same shiny stuff that's best suited to showroom floors than everyday usage. It's a true fingerprint magnet and quite hard to clean. And unlike the display, we don't think it has that extra oleophobic coating to make things easier on the cleaning cloth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is on the same place on the back but nothing suggests its improved functionality - higher resolution, auto focus and video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, Apple claim to have pimped the battery life to as much as 20%. The talk-time in 2G network has been upped to 12 hours (10 on the iPhone 3G) and the audio playback has reached 30 hours (24 on the iPhone 3G). Video playback endurance has been upgraded from 7 to 10 hours, while the stand-by and 3G talk time remain unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life scenarios we hardly saw any improvement over the iPhone 3G. If you intensively play around with apps - downloading, testing, tinkering, etc, the battery won't last you a full day, which is exactly what we had with the iPhone 3G. Perhaps turning the 3G off would help, but it makes no sense to voluntarily give in the HSDPA speeds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iPhone OS 3.0 changelog or over 100 new features for the new and older iPhones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone OS 3.0 is quite more progressive than the new iPhone 3GS itself. And since it's available to past iPhone owners as well, the 3GS certainly looses an edge here. Nevertheless, it comes with some exclusive features that are not available to the iPhone 3G despite the same OS used (you can refresh your memory on the first page).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone OS 3.0 introduces more than 100 new features, which bring the iPhone functionality up to date, while catering for some badly missed stuff, which users of other mobile phones take for granted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, Apple certainly took their time, but two years ago, even in its limited form, the Touch UI presented on the first iPhone was nothing short of revolutionary. It took the other manufacturers more than a year to catch up and though they may have long surpassed the iPhone as far as hardware is concerned, the interface remains one of the finest example of the industry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure Palm have their WebOS and Google have their Android but they have yet to close down on the fluidity, sophistication and the reach, if you like, of the Apple mobile OS. Not to mention that the fast growing Apple AppStore is making the iPhone one of the most exciting platforms to date capable of offering modern smartphone functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So after some serious work we managed to distill this list of the 100 new iPhone features introduced by the OS 3.0. Some of them are huge (in iPhone terms at least), while others are minor, but are still there. We'll cover the major ones on the following pages, but we just wanted to give you a one-page, bulleted scoop of what's changed and how.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>General user interface and key features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the surface, the traditional flat (no submenus) interface should be all too well familiar by now. Tap an icon to open an application, and then press the hardware Home key to close the application and return to the Home screen. That's all there is to it. Only the Settings portion goes several levels deep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you've probably seen on the previous page there are quite a few changes that have been introduced by iPhone OS 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regular iPhone users won't notice any performance improvements just by the very fact of upgrading (except perhaps in the web browser), but the new iPhone 3GS does bring some pure American muscle in the equation. The original iPhone 3G is a responsive device by all means, but the capable hardware under the hood of the 3GS makes a noticable difference. The iPhone 3GS is faster in all aspects - initial starting of menus, programs, and the responsiveness of screen auto rotation has also noticeably increased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an impromptu speed test between the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3G. Though it's nothing professional, we admit, it does give a perspective to how the new iPhone handles some everyday tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>After we shot this video, we also decided to clock the opponents and give you some figures to chew on. So here it goes (taken straight from the video above):</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you are interested in some more numbers, we also clocked how long it takes the iPhone 3G and 3GS to boot the iPhone 3.0 OS. Well iPhone 3GS finished in 15 seconds, while the old dog needed twice as much time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of new useful features brought about by 3.0 the first thing to mention is definitely the system-wide system search engine Spotlight. The easiest way to start that is by sliding left from the main Springboard screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By defaults, the iPhone searches in 9 "places": contacts, music, applications, mail, calendar, notes, audio books, video and podcasts. You can filter out some of those places however, or you can change their results listing priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search itself is quite fast, but we didn't have that much info on our test iPhone(s) so we can't eally comment how clogging-proof it really is. Opening any of the search results is generally fast but when you start iPod tracks directly from there, it gets a bit slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Spotlight would have been a great system settings launch tool if it included features such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi in the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone as it was had no multitasking support, and so does the iPhone 3GS. With the iPhone OS 3.0 however Apple introduced the push background notifications service instead. The service can inform you of new events in applications that support it (such as some IM client) by changing the app icon (via an icon badge), by invoking a pop-up reminder or through sound alerts. In the same time the applications can simulate that you are constantly online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next big thing is the Cut, Copy and Paste text feature. It works throughout the whole interface where you deal with text. It's not a ground-breaking feature we know, however iPhone users have been waiting for that simple thing for two years now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The support also stretches to the Safari browser (you can copy stuff from web pages), but fails to cover pop-up text boxes and games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works quite logically - you simply press and hold the finger over the text you want to start to copy, while the selected word gets marked in blue with start and end markers. Then you drag the markers until the text you want is marked. And finally, you use the cut/copy/paste/select all pop up tabs to do the action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Peculiarly, the copied text is preserved in the clipboard even after a system restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next feature is the redo/undo function, which can be used in any program that calls up the keyboard. You have to shake the phone or just flick it to see the undo/redo dialog box. Of course, if you do not need it, you can switch the feature off so it won't bug you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The system-wide landscape QWERTY keyboard is also among the handy upgrades. You are now allowed to use the landscape keyboard mode in messaging, notes, contacts (partially), and of course in the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were surprised that the landscape mode is not available when entering text in Calendar - somebody at Apple must have missed that we guess. The same is with the Contacts - the only possible way is via "Add to Contacts" feature from new message opened in landscape mode. Google maps also cannot rotate the map and the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Apple iPhone 3GS has two new features that are not available to the iPhone 3G. This is the Voice control and the magnetic compass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Control app supports lots of commands: call a phone name/number, play music by song/album/artist name, shuffle music and Genius support for playing more similar songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You don't need to pre-record your voice commands, as the recognition is speaker-independent. There's support for over 30 with their local variations such as Chinese Mainland or Chinese Taiwan, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Control app can be launched with a longer press of the Home key. The interface is simple. You pronounce a command and the application response. If you have a match, the result is automatically displayed/dialed, if not, the program quits. That quitting is quite inconvenient, because you have to start the application again to retry the command.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key when using it is to say the right commands. The music-oriented functions include ?Play artist? or ?Play songs by,? ?Play playlist,? ?Play album,? ?Pause,? ?Play music,? ?Genius,? ?Next track,? ?Previous track,? ?Shuffle,? and ?What is this song called??</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you try and improvise saying "Play Sting" or whatever artist you need, the iPhone won't handle it at all as it?s expecting to hear ?artist? or ?songs by? as a prefix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compass works in Google maps and third party maps, but also has its own application, which allows you to see your exact GPS coordinates and toggle between true North and magnetic North.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated application seems quite inaccurate at times and quite often gave us some interference alerts In Google Maps however, the maps auto rotation is quite accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the new iPhone 3GS is also optimized for the disabled people. Three features are integrated to aid those get around the interface easier: Voice over, Interface zoom and White-on-black color combo. We haven't seen so much optimizations targeted at disabled people on any other mobile phone. The Voice over is a text-to-speech feature, which also pronounces the name of each menu item as you go through the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this mode a single click marks a button and reads its name; a double click opens it, while swiping with tree fingers allows you to scroll up an down. The pronunciation speed and voice can also be customized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zoom feature magnifies the interface screen in every application. To zoom in the UI you have to double-tap the screen with three fingers. The White on Black makes the UI high-contrasty to help the visually impaired.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts management has seen some improvements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The nice Contacts department in 3GS has got several new features we just take for granted on any other phone: (1) share contact via mail or MMS in the widely accepted .vcf format and (2) call duration notification in the Recents call list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out the new calls counter acts rather bizarrely. We tried a call between two iPhones that went on for exactly to 1 min 32 sec. Then it turned out that both iPhones had it differently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calling iPhone reported a call duration of 2 minutes, while the receiving iPhone stored that as 1 minute call. It is probably a bug that needs some attention from the Cupertino team and we advise you to take these figures with a pinch of salt for the time being.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts search box or the dialer for that matter still doesn't support Smart dialing (though Spotlight is a good substitute). The phonebook also lacks an interface for deleting contacts en masse or at least the no-brainer slide-to-delete option that is widely available in mail, notes and other third party software and can be easily used for deleting contacts without opening their details.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While network coverage of the iPhone 3GS was a bit dodgy in tight urban spots, in most cases in-call quality was just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The really nice news about the iPhone 3GS however is the improved speakerphone performance. The new iPhone scored the Good mark as oposed to the Below average one of both the previous iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 3GS has improved the most in our pink noise test, which means that music playback has been the area that got the most significant volume boost. With the other two tests the improvements were marginal (if any), yet the 3GS jumped all the way up to the Good mark thanks to the fact that the end score is a sum of all sub scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is finally up to scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the main features of every phone, the messaging, has been greatly improved in the iPhone OS 3.0</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the separate msg balloons in a threaded story can be deleted individually or several ones can be picked for en masse deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other new thing is the option to forward one or several SMS or MMS messages from a threaded conversation. The text is combined in one SMS/MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally you can disable text message reminder alerts or disable text message previews.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the SMS improvements, there is now full MMS integration. Interestingly enough, before you set up MMS connectivity, you won't see any signs of it around the general interface at all. And even worse, straight out of the box, the MMS settings are not user configurable either so the only way to set them is to have your carrier supply them to you. We guess that's a way for carriers to restrict MMS usage as they please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are workarounds for that of course, but they won't help you with every carrier there is. You can try googling "Enabling MMS on iPhone 3.0" and see what options you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the MMS you can receive vCards, audio files and location data. An exclusive for the iPhone 3G S is the option to send video using the MMS, thanks to its ability to record video clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing MMS is as easy as it gets. You can choose from existing photo or you can take one with camera just before sending the MMS. One image can be captured or selected at a time. For another, you have to press the camera icon again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sending multiple photos, GPS coordinates or clips is initiated outside the messaging department via the respective Share function of those apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the iPhone 2G has been left out of the MMS equation but as it turned out it's probably Apple trying to get 2G users more reasons to upgrade to 3GS. A fix for enabling the MMS feature on the 3G is available via the unofficial third-party app repository Cydia. To get that, you have to jailbreak your iPhone 2G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email is expanded too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The email client has also seen several improvents and upgrades but still misses the most important one - threaded view of a mail. In this aspect, the dedicated mobile versions of Gmail or Yahoo! Mail look quite better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With OS 3.0 the email has got a Search bar on top which searches in sender, recipient and subject. Unfortunately, it doesn't search in the email body, so we hope too see Apple add that as well in the next OS upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've got a remote syncing setup going on such as MobileMe or MS Exchange 2007 and later, you can continue the search on the server going beyond what's in your local mailbox</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty is the new action button in Photos lets you choose multiple pictures to attach to a mail message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now even send the full-res 3MP photos made by the iPhone camera via email. To do that you must keep away from the regular email attachment routine and instead you should simply go to gallery, mark as many pics you need, copy them and then paste them in the mail body. If you prefer to attach the images the regular way, they will get downsized.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Search-and-play iPod<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The multimedia department has also benefitted from the iPhone 3.0 OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPod player now accommodates its own local search, apart of the General Spotlight search. The results get displayed sorted by Albums and Songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another very handy tool in the iPod player is the media scrubber which allows more precise rewinding and fast-forwarding in music and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular action of dragging the position indicator along the playback axis skips larger portions of the audio track or video, but if you slide your finger down the screen without letting go the position indicator, shifting back and forward gets more precise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another hip new feature is the shake-to-shuffle function (can be disabled). Each shuffle is accompanied with a system sound, which unfortunately cannot be disabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Listening to music while charging the battery now displays the album art instead of the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cupertino team has also allowed third-party apps to get access to the iPod music library, which for example means you can use your own music while playing games, or allows or some amusing music applications to be created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 3.0 OS users can finally enjoy listening music with stereo Bluetooth headsets or compatible Bluetooth speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the Bluetooth connection with a Sony Ericsson MBS-200 Bluetooth speaker and found out that the sound volume cannot be toggled from the phone, but only from the Speaker volume rocker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>YouTube logs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The big news for the YouTube app in iPhone 3.0 is the account integration. Personal subscriptions and playlists are now accessible after login. Users can now also view comments and rate videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already wrote, YouTube video uploading is a snap and it even works in the background allowing you to shoot more videos while you upload the first one. There are some limitations to it. For instance, the maximum duration of uploads should be no longer than 10 minutes. Also YouTube resizes the video files to 480 x 360 pixels and at least for the time being the re-compression outputs quite pixelated videos, perhaps YouTube will optimize their encoding for the iPhone uploaded videos to achieve better quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality deserves a High-Five<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just when we thought that they cannot get much better in this area and here come Apple to surprise us. The audio quality of the iPhone 3G was almost as good as it gets on a portable device and now with the iPhone 3GS it is simply perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPod's bigger brother provides the best sonic experiences on the market with all of its readings simply remarkable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the improvements over the previous gen iPhones is concerned, the iPhone 3GS sports a much improved frequency response with the other readings almost on par. No one will probably be able to tell the differences in distortion levels for example, but this is mostly because the iPhone 3G performed flawlessly there to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But here are the results, so you can see for yourselves. You can find more information about the test itself and the meaning of the different numbers in the table here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 3GS frequency response is simply flawless</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 MP touch-focus camera with video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 3GS camera has been upgraded to 3 megapixels only - probably to keep the waistline of the 3GS down. Yes, it sound kinda lame having only a 3 megapixel snapper on a high-end pricey device, but still Apple chose to go for only a diminutive megapixel upgrade here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most importantly beside the more megapixels, there's now touch AF and video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch AF works very fast and accurate. It even tracks moving subjects after you tap on them with a finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface is more than simple - the only controls are the camera/recorder key and a small thumbnail in the corner that shows the last taken photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera quality is ok actually. Colors seem balanced and the image is nicely sharpened with relatively good reproduction of details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An easily visible drawback however is the high noise level - just look for the grainy effect found all over. That amount of noise is way too much even for a mobile phone camera. The only good thing about the noise is that the luminance noise is much more than the nasty chromatic noise, which usually takes the shape of variously colored dots across the photo and is much more nagging. Plus the noise on these photos has some nice pattern, which adds for subtle analogue film-like effect. But it's noise after all and it's there on all photos - even those made in bright daylight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the end, we've seen better 3 megapixel cameras on phones, but the iPhone 3GS does alright. It's only that some users would have preferred a higher megapixel count. If LG can fit a 5 megapixel camera in the 12mm LG Arena and an 8 megapixel one in the 12.4mm LG Viewty Smart, then it shouldn't bother Apple fitting something more substantial despite the thin 12.3mm iPhone girth. So we guess, it's a marketing decision after all - you know, probably something along the lines of "keep the specs down so we can upgrade more easily in the future". Hardly a user-friendly approach, we know, but it seems to do the trick for Apple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several Apple iPhone 3GS camera samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When they announced all the "sizzling" camera features of the new iPhone 3GS the guys from Apple also threw in the magical "improved low light performance" line. If you know us, you'd do know that we live for lines like that. Disproving high-flown pitch phrases is the most fun part of our job. But again, the best times are when marketing has not lied but we indeed see improvement of any sort. So we organized an impromptu low-light shootout among several handsets, none of which is famous for its low light performance, just so we check whether the iPhone 3GS is any better than the 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>INDOORS: Low light samples without flash - full resolution:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since objectively judging image quality based on full resolution samples produced by cameras of different calibers will be a daunting task to anyone, we decided to take them all and downsize them to a more appropriate 2 megapixel level. If you haven't noticed up so far, downsizing images actually hides excessive noise, so no one of our competitors should be in a disadvantageous position. Besides the Apple iPhone 3G of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s funny we should say that, but quite subjectively the results by the iPhone 3G are our favorites. If anything else, at least it's easy to spot that the iPhone 3GS doesn't offer superior results to iPhone 3G. So, that's done, here's another high-pitched copy busted!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>INDOORS: Low light samples without flash - downsized to 2 megapixels:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OUTDOORS: Low light samples without flash - full resolution:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally it comes the time for our studio resolution chart. This is a standard ISO12233 chart used for evaluating the synthetic resolution of digital cameras. It is an excellent tool for measuring pure horizontal and vertical resolution and also offers a good reference point for comparison of resolution between cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The long parallel lines serve as good measurement of resolved resolution. The point where the lines are no longer clearly separated is where the resolution resolved by the camera maxes out. There's a number scale alongside so you can even set a number corresponding to the camera's performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The several different line sets are taken from various places across the frame so you also have a nice representation how the image resolution changes as you go towards the edges of the frame (poor optics are far blurry towards the frame ends than in the frame center).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have some grey and color test charts stuck on there - those show how the noise suppressing algorithm affects the various colors (usually different) and how the algorithm affects the detail in the shadows. Usually with a poor camera you can't distinguish any difference in the shades of black, while in reality there is some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPhone 3GS records video in VGA resolution at 30 fps. The .MOV file format of the clip shouldn't surprise anybody we guess. The video quality, colors and contrast are relatively ok. The iPhone 3GS could benefit from some sort of digital image stabilization to keep handshake under control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 3GS sample video - VGA@30fps, MOV file format (approx. 7MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting drawback to video recording we experience and successfully recreated on several occasions includes the audio recording unexpectedly cutting on us when shooting in loud environment (say, a night club). Yes, shooting video with the iPhone 3GS in really noisy environment such as a night club makes the camera stop recording sound at its whim - for no particular reason, whenever and for how long it decides it's appropriate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video clips are stored in the camera roll and are indicated with a play icon. They can be send via email, MMS or can be directly uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>YouTube video uploading is a snap and it even works in the background allowing you to shoot more videos while you upload the first one. There are some limitations to it. For instance, the maximum duration of uploads should be no longer than 10 minutes. Also YouTube resizes the video files to 480 x 360 pixels and at least for the time being the recompression outputs quite pixelated videos, perhaps YouTube will optimize their encoding for the iPhone uploaded videos to achieve better quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recorded clips can also be trimmed. When in editing mode, the video is shown in filmstrip line, surrounded by a yellow box. After positioning the beginning and end of the trimming zone, the clip is ready for precise editing. You simply have to hold your finger down on the yellow box to activate the precise editing mode. There is a play button for quick preview as well as a yellow Trim button for saving the result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, at least until iPhone OS 3.1 doesn't make it to the scene, saving a clip after editing it WILL OVERWRITE the original video file. Quite a nuisance, we know!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Safari remembers passwords, auto-fills data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We consider the password and auto fill managers the most important update of the Safari browser in the iPhone 3.0 OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The password manager can store various website credentials (username and password) eliminating the need for entering them each time you visit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pop-up menu of the manager appears only when users try to enter username and password in the provided fields. If more than one username was used for a site, the last one is displayed. Changing with other is as easy as it gets - just type the first letter of the alternative username and hit next ant the new name and pass will be entered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AutoFill works both with either previously entered information in a contact entry, or with previously entered data in similar fields. It offers to fill in the details for you, when you are working on some online form. That's quite handy on a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an anti-phishing tool built-in right there in the web browser with support for the latest standards for secure access and information sharing on the web. It includes built-in anti-phishing technology that detects fraudulent websites and support for EV (Extended Validation) Certificates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari has also got new Copy Link and Open in New Page commands. Holding down a thumb over a hyperlink grants you these new options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some other improvements under the hood of the mobile browser. Thanks to the new SquirelFish Extreme engine rendering HTML and especially JavaScript with iPhone 3.0 OS should now be faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to see how fast it really gets, we ran an impromptu speed test on both the iPhone 2G (2.2.1 OS) and the 3G (3.0 OS). After that we tested the iPhone 3GS as well which supposedly has both the benefit of the new rendering engine and the faster hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this test we used a random synthetic JavaScript test that we found in the top results in Google. We executed it over the same Wi-Fi connection and we grabbed the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out the iPhone 3G is up to 2x faster than iPhone 2G running the previous 2.x OS. Since the processing power of both phones is the same, it can be concluded that the speed boost can be attributed solely to the new rendering engine. So the new software surely brings around some improved performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same time, the new iPhone 3GS is up to 3x times faster in JavaScript benchmarks over iPhone 3G - obviously thanks to the added oomph in the engine compartment. And you'd be interested to see that it even gets close to the results by the desktop Internet Explorer 7 web browser. To make things even more fun, we also threw Firefox 3.0 and IE 8.0 into the fray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we don't have the iPhone 2G (2.2.1) to publish here but you can take our word for it - the score there was around 10,000ms. And remember - lower numbers means less time of Javascript crunching so essentially lower is better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A word of caution is due here - JavaScript benchmarks are not indicative of how fast the web browser is in real life scenarios. Some web pages may not even use JavaScript in their code, while others (such as some picture galleries) may rely heavily on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are wondering how much faster the iPhone 3GS really is in real-life web browsing, then you should jump back to the forth page of this review and check out the results below the video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Maps have a new friend - the digital compass<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>T-Mobile G1 was among the first phones to start the digital compass trends in touch phones and many of the other manufacturers quickly followed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple have also thrown in the obviously easy to integrate magnetometer and on iPhone 3GS it's fully integrated with the Google Maps application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another huge change is Apple have finally made possible third-party GPS navigation with offline maps and turn-by-turn 3D voice navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first fully-fledged sat-nav app released in the AppStore is Navigon's MobileNavigator. Though a little pricey, the application is a nice tool for turn-by-turn voice guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got really nice graphics, it's got top notch POI database and the on-screen perspective and zoom level changes automatically according to the driving speed and the terrain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application of course has its drawbacks, but we are not up doing third-party application reviews now, we just wanted to show you the new and exciting options available to GPS-equipped iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other leading GPS navigation developers have already declared their intent to release sat-nav applications for iPhone as well - TomTom and iGo, to name a few.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity boosted to the limits<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the most important upgrades that come with the iPhone 3.0 OS is the ability for third-party developers to build apps that communicate with accessories or peripherals over the USB or Bluetooth connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life this means that iPhone will be able to connect with, display data for, and/or control items as cameras, barcode readers, game controllers, and even keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Peer-to-Peer connectivity is the other huge step ahead. This opens new doors to apps and devices to communicate and exchange data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bluetooth v2.1 now has accommodated A2DP profile and can transfer music to compatible stereo Bluetooth headset or speakers. There's still no file transfers allowed, but you can establish peer-to-peer connections over Bluetooth when Wi-Fi is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi is well known since the first iPhone, but now it features auto-login for public Wi-Fi hotspots (ones that have login redirects) and peer-to-peer functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New to Network Settings is the Internet Tethering. It is operator depended as it requires on operator provided connection settings, but there are workarounds for that. Just Google around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internet tethering itself can be made either via USB or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the new iPhone 3GS boasts HSDPA 7.2 Mbps, which should be considerably faster than the iPhone 3G if your network supports such speeds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>AppStore changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Some of the hundred-or-so updates that Apple has introduced with the 3.0 OS concern the AppStore too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The greatest update for the AppStore is the option to log in directly from iPhone as well as to create new accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing screenshots of apps in the Store is now changed as well with a sideways scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Application subscriptions for a monthly fee are also among the new features. Some applications will offer users services based on a monthly flat rate. AT&amp;T Navigator is a nice example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also third-party applications can now have In-App Purchases, meaning paid apps will be able to offer users optional upgrades or modules directly from the application environment (think an e-book reader with books available for purchases). Unfortunately, free apps will not be able to offer paid upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The business model for in-app purchases will be the same as the current model: Apple gets 30 percent of the revenue, while developers take home 70 percent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Upgraded organizer and pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this section, we'll discuss only the applications that have been upgraded in some aspects compared to the old iPhone 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most commonly used one is Notes. Notes now feature a local search field which looks for the requested information in the title and note's body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also swipe-to-delete a note without opening it. Finally the notes now can also be synchronized to third party applications (Outlook) via iTunes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPhone 3.0 OS has finally got another application that's basic for most other phones - the Voice Memos. The simple interface reveals old style microphone and two controls - one for record/pause and other for listing the recorded clips. Files are recorded in m4a format with very good quality but not too big for sharing. Audio records can also be trimmed and saved as well as shared via MMS or Email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also label each record with with pre-defined tags including None, Podcast, Interview, Lecture, Idea, Meeting, Memo or you can input your own Label via the Custom tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is almost unchanged. There is still no landscape view or week view. Except this, there are two new features for Exchange users. You can now add Invitees and set Availability when adding a new event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Deeply hidden in the Settings menu is the the new LDAP (contacts directory), CalDAV, and Calendar Subscription, to be found under Add Account, Other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks app powered by Yahoo has got a swipe-across section that displays stocks details, charts and news feeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rotating Stocks to landscape mode now expands the graph to full, wide screen mode, similarly to the calculator application. Point a section on the graph and you'll get an exact price quote for that day. Swiping left or right will reveal info for the other stocks you've subscribed to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's true that the iPhone 3GS brings over only incrementing changes, there's nothing ground breaking about it. But before everything else, the newly introduced changes on both software AND hardware level will make the new iPhone 3GS a more balanced smartphone most of all. That will give it some more charisma and it will hopefully lure some new users and get most current iPhone 2G users trade in their devices for a piece of Apple's latest tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sounds like quite a plan and indeed, the iPhone 3GS is a top-notch hardware platform for experiencing one of the most advanced touch user interfaces to date (not to mention the ridiculously easy and dun way to get yourself geared with tons of apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But by keeping the old design of the device Apple took quite a risky step. As if they wanted to keep their 3G user base where they are - consuming apps at a fast rate - and are willingly putting them off from upgrading. As we can't really imagine how many people would want to shell out the cash for a new phone that looks just the same as their old one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real truth about the iPhone 3GS is that though it may look the same, the 3GS has got some new feel to it that certainly makes a difference.</paragraph>
