			<paragraph>A dazzling handset with a music talent: Sony Ericsson W660 will not only charm the ladies with its delicate beauty, it will connect them to the world and entertain them, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A dandy with an ear for music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Outspokenly tech and sporty, Sony Ericsson's Walkman Series have so far seemed intended to attract men. A Walkman handset could hardly be seen in a lady's hand, let alone that of a fashion sensitive female user. Yet, the appeal of portable music devices has never seemed to depend on gender. And Sony Ericsson figured it out: W660. With W660, Sony Ericsson follows the trail blazed by Nokia, trying to fill all the niches on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finished in red and gold, Sony Ericsson W660 is the latest and most delicate addition to the Walkman Series. Red is the dominant color with highlights of gold on a few details like the stripe along the sides of the device, the navigation keys, and the Walkman logo. The rear panel is especially attractive - half of it is made of smooth plastic covering the battery, while the other half is encrusted with fine flower ornaments, with the camera lens and speaker amidst. In the black version of SE W660 the flower-like ornaments are replaced by fine concentric circles. The handset is truly a piece to brag about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A wrist strap eyelet is placed at the bottom of the battery cover. UMTS-enabled, Sony Ericsson W660 has another camera lens on the front, above the display. The earpiece is marked by three horizontally placed dots. Circles are a repetitive decoration element; most of the controls in these handsets are of a round shape. Beneath the display there are 6 selection keys and a 5-way navigation key. All controls are of quite small size and therefore inconvenient for users with larger fingers. Sorry, gentlemen. Ladies, on the contrary, are likely to find them truly enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone only features a Fast-port connector and a microphone grill. On the left side you will see the Memory Stick Micro card slot. The slot is protected by a plastic cap, which is fixed to the body of the device and thus hard-to-lose. A little higher on the same side is the play/stop button, which will only work if the keypad is unlocked. On the other side of the phone is the camera button. It's only got a capture function, as the camera lacks autofocus. At the very top edge of the right side you will find the volume rocker, which works even when the keypad is locked. The on/off button, which also changes ringing profiles, is the only control on the top side of the Sony Ericsson W660.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reliable keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display takes almost half of the front panel. In technical terms, it's an average-quality active 262K color TFT display with a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels. While the number of colors displayed is not that important, resolution is usually crucial and we find it insufficient in the case of SE W660. In fact, QVGA has long been considered standard in handsets of this class. On the other hand, the display of Sony Ericsson W660 is perfectly legible under direct sunlight, which is almost as important as resolution. We recommend you use color schemes of maximum contrast in bright summer days, preferably those with black font on white background. Visibility under direct sunlight usually suffers with darker schemes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigation and selection keys operate a standard menu, which needs little presentation. Typical for all Walkman phones, the dedicated Walkman Player shortcut is also present here. The navigation key is enhanced with Walkman Player controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features a standard numeric keypad, though kind of crammed down to the bottom of the handset. The keys are made of rather soft plastic material and are therefore a bit unstable. Nevertheless, in contrast to the control keys, they are big and tactile enough to minimize typing errors. The backlighting of the keypad is white and uneven.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Zero modifications in the menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have used a Sony Ericsson model in the past you will feel at home with this new Walkman phone. The menu has undergone no significant modifications. The device is controlled by 2 functional keys, plus the C (delete) key and the "back" key. Navigation is quite simple and we believe that it will take even absolute beginners a short while to master it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If preinstalled graphic themes do not meet your requirements, you can create a theme of your own. Theme changing also modifies the icons in the main menu. Our favorite theme is the elegant golden-black Spinnin as it perfectly blends with the phone's exterior. The display goes out as soon as the keypad has been locked, but can be lit up by pressing a random key. This is the simplest way to check the current status of the phone. Sony Ericsson W660 responds to user commands immediately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's talk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook fits a total of 1000 contacts with up to 2500 phone numbers. You can set the way contacts are organized: by first or last name. However, searching in both fields simultaneously is impossible and that is definitely a feature we miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers plenty of practical functions. You can back up all contacts on the memory card, which comes in handy should the device has to be left for repairs, for example. Contacts can be copied and moved from the SIM card to the phone memory and vice versa; they can be assigned shortcut keys for speed dialing, as well as organized in groups. Moreover, each contact can be assigned a special image and ringtone. You can also use ringtones stored on the memory card. As usual, Sony Ericsson offers exceptional ringing profiles, including a wide range of setting options; incoming calls can be filtered by manually created list of contacts or by way of contact groups. What else to ask for?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike W610, Sony Ericsson W660 offers UMTS and video calls. The latter are executed as in any other 3G phone. The quality of the earphones enclosed in the retail package is surprisingly high. Sound is rich and natural. Ongoing calls can be recorded from the menu. Sony Ericsson W660 performs admirably even with third party wireless headsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Texting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No news in the text message department either. SMS are standard; smilies are fast to attach and T9 is very user-friendly. The MMS editor implemented in the phone deserves a compliment too. MMS are composed intuitively, sending and receiving go the good old way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W660 has a good email client, even though it misses some important niceties. A spam filter, for example. The client sends out and receives attachments. When sending images, reducing image size prior to sending is an option you can choose. Regular mailbox checking is available too. E-mail addresses can be inserted straight from the phonebook, which in such cases only shows contacts with full email address. To sum up, the Sony Ericsson W660 is up to any user's daily needs as regards email and messaging.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet and communication<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we've noticed in the last few years, Sony Ericsson tends to ignore EDGE not only in its standard models, but also in its upmarket business handsets like the new Sony Ericsson P1. W660 is no exception to the rule - it offers UMTS, but no EDGE. This is also the key difference between W660 and W610, which did not support UMTS, but had EDGE. Which technology to use is a matter of preference. The phone also has a slower GPRS Class 10 to offer. Mobile data transfers have been improved. You get a standard Internet browser including the option to resize pages to fit the display. The browser can work in landscape mode and has a RSS reader, but it is most suitable for browsing text and PDA versions of web pages. If you need to log on to more elaborate websites, we recommend you use the Java-based Opera Mini. RSS works smoothly and it also offers updates in pre-set intervals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman is not Cybershot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Totally music-centered, Walkman phones are known for paying little heed to camera and photography. In Sony Ericsson W660 that's even more obvious. The 2-megapixel camera lacks autofocus, making close-ups and text a tough job to shoot. There's no LED or xenon flash either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality could hardly be called impressive. Even pictures taken in very good light conditions come out of focus. Blurriness is unpleasantly intensified by the higher jpeg compression that is used. All photos published in this review were taken at the highest resolution and best quality level. Yet, we believe that photos would have come out much better if the compression wasn't so high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the same time the camera of Sony Ericsson W660 deserves a compliment for its rich setting options and extra functions. You get white balance, automatic insertion of data into the images, various effects, a self-release timer, etc. Images do not look burnt out; exposure is spot-on. Sony Ericsson W660 also shoots videos, although the resolution of 176 x 144 is not impressive by any means. All in all, the Walkman and Cybershot lines, still avoid crossing over their territories.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fun and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W660 handles Java applications well. All programs we tested ran fluently in mobile data transfers as well as Bluetooth communication protocols. One application that worked seamlessly on that phone was the great Handygeocaching, which simultaneously communicates with a GPS module and obtains data via mobile data transfers. Although Java applications' Bluetooth compatibility may seem natural, there are many, even recent, models that do not support it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two preinstalled games in the phone: Snowboarding and Tower Bloxx. The first one is entertaining enough, while the latter will only keep you interested for a few minutes, before getting rather repetitive. Sony Ericsson W660 also has a video player supporting MP4 and 3GP formats. Images can be rotated and videos can be played in a landscape as well as in full-screen mode. Great, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PhotoDJ, VideoDJ, and MusicDJ applications are available too. They allow you to play with pictures, create slideshows and videos or mixing your own melodies, which is an activity far more interesting than any Java game.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calendar: could've been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's now have a look at the organizing functions. The calendar hasn't changed a jot and still occupies too much space on the display. There's also a monthly view, as well as short text descriptions of the events for the respective day. Events are not distinguished by type (meeting, memo, call, etc.) as they are in other phones. Instead they are only one type with enough room for custom settings. Both events and tasks can be sent via Bluetooth, email, as well as MMS and SMS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>W as in Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman label on this new Sony Ericsson handset guarantees the presence of several important properties, common for all Walkman mobiles: a very good music player, state-of-the-arts earphones, a stereo radio with RDS and a larger memory card enclosed in the retail package - a 512MB one in this case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardly any headsets delivered as part of the retail package of current mobile phones manage to satisfy us. The great exception to this rule is the headsets Sony Ericsson usually ships with its Walkman models. The set in this phone shows good, synchronized dynamics. Preset equalizers provide a balanced audio performance. To enhance the bass response and seal out ambient noise Sony Ericsson W660 offers a variety of rubber ear buds for a comfortable fit in the ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cable of the earphones is divided in two - a wired remote with a 3.5 mm jack and the headphones themselves. The remote also features a Send/End key, and a microphone. The standard 3.5 mm jack on it allows the use of custom headphones. This layout makes virtually any type of headphones usable as a hands-free set. The one and only inconvenience is the excessive length of the cable. The Sony Ericsson W660 standard headphones are of such high quality though, that few users will opt for another set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is equipped with the Walkman 2.0 music player - the same as the one in Sony Ericsson W850. Music files are sorted by ID3 tags; the player ignores any kind of filing into playlists. Given the absence of correct ID3 details on some songs, I personally prefer to select and play the entire list.. Sony Ericsson W660 plays MP3, WMA and all kinds of AAC formats. It also offers the Disc2Phone application (traditionally implemented in Sony Ericsson Walkman models), which enables fast transfers of audio CD to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the player can be minimized when active; the home screen then displays a bar with details on the current track is shown. Volume is controlled through the respective side keys even if the keypad is locked. An equalizer with manual setup options, shuffle and repeat, and three different visualizations are also present. W660 offers light effects too - for example, the central navigation key can blink to the rhythm of the music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio application has not been modified. It supports RDS and memorizes up to 20 stations, which can be quickly browsed . Yet, there is one drawback: frequent switching between stations seems more comfortable with Nokia models, as they allow changing stations through a button on the hands-free control pad. Sony Ericsson, however, offers no such option and one has to pull the phone out of their pocket every time a switch is necessary. In brief: Sony Ericsson W660 brings no music innovations, but it does its job just fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>TrackID first appeared in W850, and has undergone basically no changes. The phone records a bit of music via the microphone or from the radio. TrackID then connects to the Internet and checks the recorded track in a worldwide database. In case of a positive match, the Internet browser recovers the name of the performer, the song and the album. The service alone is free of charge, but data transfers of about 25-30 KB per every request are not. Illogically, TrackID cannot be applied when the music player is active. It does work when the player is minimized, but the current track is muted. It is quite strange that Sony Ericsson has failed to eliminate this drawback given the application dates back to the Sony Ericsson W850 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Songs by Louis Armstrong, Seal, Jamiroquai, Morcheeba or Pet Shop Boys were easy to find, but they were hardly a challenge. When we tried to search for less known tracks like Gabriel by Lamb, TrackID filed it into one of the Cafe Del Mar albums instead of the correct What Sound. Still, TrackID managed to recognize older Savatage songs as well as new solo albums by John Oliva and Chris Caffery, which proves its reliability. TrackID performance is ambiguous as far as movie soundtracks are concerned. It recognized Solaris by Cliff Martinez, K-Pax by Edward Shearmur, and the Lost in translation soundtrack, but failed in the search of Birdcage and Requiem for a Dream.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike most people, we found the TrackID service useful. Just imagine how often you hear interesting music and think "Wow, it would be great to make a note of this track!" Now you can. Too much fuss for nothing?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson models usually feature long-lasting batteries. Inside the Sony Ericsson family, the W660 belongs to the middle class: a few calls, data transfers and SMS a day will require charging approximately every three days (without switching off the phone at night). In 3G networks battery may last even less. Anyway, with Sony Ericsson W660 "you'll never walk alone" as the phone constantly shows status details, which are useful indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of content, Sony Ericsson W660 brings no innovations; it's the good old applications and functions, but with a facelift. From the point of view of conventional users, however, W660 scores brilliantly in all aspects, except for the absence of EDGE. This phone is great in terms of communication and will meet any of your daily needs with ease. The only obstacle to the Sony Ericsson W660 market success remains its high price. This money can easily get you a smartphone these days. Your personal preference is what matters here. For example, the more affordable W610 seems a better choice for users who don't need UMTS. And then, W610 has EDGE and autofocus, adding extra value to such a purchase.</paragraph>
