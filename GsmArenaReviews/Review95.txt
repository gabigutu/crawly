			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A blue earth it is. We mean there's no need to tell you our home planet is not quite in the pink. So, before you go on reading, you might want to turn off the lights and the telly, and go pick up a wind turbine and a bunch of solar panels at the local DIY. Forget where you put the car keys? Good, get the bike. Samsung says thanks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, now seriously. Maybe it's good to know you're not the only one using recycled paper, composting your garbage and flushing the toilet responsibly. Samsung are perhaps really trying to encourage the effort. The S7550 Blue Earth is a gadget that gives much credence to the likely growth of eco-friendly products and technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Blue Earth is a solar powered, eco-friendly phone that promotes green thinking. It's made of recycled water bottles, has an ultra low standby power DC charger and comes in a reusable box made of recycled paper. The first solar-powered touchscreen has a special "eco mode" to use the display in an energy efficient manner. The accelerometer-based step counter has a new spin to it too. It calculates how much CO2 would have been released if you drove instead of walked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another quite appropriate feature is the Eco Day list in the calendar, which gives you all the environment-related dates celebrated around the world. Without the Samsung Blue Earth we'd still be ignorant enough not to know what day is today. OK, not in that sense, but we honestly had no idea that September 16th is the World Ozone Day. So, take a deep breath, congratulate us on our timing and get ready for the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solar panel is enough of a rarity in mobile phones. The Blue Earth is only the second mass production handset to have it, next to another Samsung phone - the entry level E1107 Crest Solar. Samsung E200 ECO in turn, was the company's first device made of environmentally-friendly materials. Eco-friendly telephony is not exclusive Samsung territory though. The Sony Ericsson GreenHeart program, as well as phones like Motorola W233 Renew and Nokia 3110 Evolve, show that major manufacturers are willing to at least explore this market niche.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the Samsung Blue Earth does look like the most complete and focused product to date. The eco-friendly concept was so far tested on rather marginal handsets - a straight-up remake like the Sony Ericsson C901 GreenHeart or downright basic phones. The Samsung Blue Earth tries to be different and we don't mean the relevant applications and the solar panel only. It's a fully featured phone and a touchscreen at that. That it was made with care for the environment doesn't mean they didn't care about the specs. The S7550 is a midrange phone which has more to offer than some of the recent Samsung bestsellers in the touchscreen category (take the S5230 Star for example). On top of the capacitive screen and TouchWiz, you get 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS and rich media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not the least, the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth is committed to its cause and you know that before you even take it out of the box. The retail package is enough of a green statement itself. Let's see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A tree-hugging retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Blue Earth phone comes in a small box made of recycled paper, which can - and we guess, must - be reused. As shown on a diagram under the cover, the retail box can be made into a photo frame, pen stand etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box contents are quite obviously kept to the minimum - you'll find a detachable headset, a small user manual, and an energy-efficient DC charger, which uses less than 0.03W of standby power. The only gripe we have is that there is no USB cable here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S7550 Blue Earth 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Blue Earth stands at 107 x 53 x 13.9 mm and we find it quite decently sized for a 3" touchscreen. You'll appreciate the relatively compact appearance and feel of the phone but we guess you won't be expecting the solid weight of 118.9g. The plastic front might fool you but do keep in mind that the rear cover is unusual enough. It features a solar panel on the outside and a metal plate inside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth has a lot in common with the Samsung S3650 Corby we just recently reviewed. The screen size of course makes quite some difference. The touchscreen form factor is more or less repetitive but the Samsung Blue Earth is a novel enough concept to be mistaken. The unique rear makes it really a two-faced handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exterior of the phone does not give any clue that it uses recycled bottles of water as its main material. The oval shapes and smooth design with its shaded dark-to-light blue coloring makes the phone quite appealing. The build quality is commendable while the solar panel on the back looks quite tough too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth is understandably dominated by the touchscreen, all 3 inches of it. The 16M-color touchscreen display has WQVGA (240 x 400 pixels) resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S7550 touchscreen uses capacitive technology and it responds promptly to taps and sweeps. The resolution is not the best though with notable banding in some background images. Not that it's too much of an issue, but the Blue Earth's WQVGA screen stands no comparison to the WVGA AMOLED display of the Pixon12. Legibility suffers under direct sunlight but indoor performance is quite alright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three regular keys - the Call and End keys, plus the Back key in the middle. The controls are well defined and have a solid press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Blue Earth is quite plain and features the lanyard eyelet only. The bottom section isn't crowded either - the mic hole and a thumb rest for removing the battery cover/ solar panel are the only things to note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key and the Hold key are placed within a single long button but the camera key is tangibly raised to ensure proper handing and touch orientation. The microUSB headset port under a plastic lid is in the upper right corner of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the handset is mostly taken by the solar panel, which is used for charging the phone battery. The rest of the rear accommodates the 3 MP camera lens, a charging indicator next to it and a loudspeaker grill under the Samsung logo at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tiny dot next to the camera lens is an indicator that glows in blue to show the battery is charging off the solar panel. Samsung claim that one hour of solar charging should provide 2 hours of standby and a little over 15 minutes of call time in 2G networks or alternatively 10 minutes of talk time via UMTS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the solid rear panel reveals the 1080 mAh Li-Ion battery, the microSD card slot and the SIM card compartment. The 2 pairs of power connectors for the solar panel can clearly be seen around the memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Samsung Blue Earth is really top notch. The styling and shape are commendable too. The screen sunlight performance is probably the only big issue with this phone. Another thing to note is that the solar panel at the rear tends to get quite greasy as you handle the handset longer and doesn't allow as firm grip as we would have liked.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz UI gets eco-friendly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S7550 Blue Earth comes with Samsung's user interface for touch-based phones - the TouchWiz. It is as usable as ever, though they've cut down on the eye-candy a little - both Motion gate and Media gate are gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No big deal, the homescreen has plenty of widgets and the new customizable menu is here to make using the phone easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth has the same homescreen layout as the Jet - it gives you three different non-scrollable screens that you can alternate by sideways sweeps. To help you orient, there are three small squares at the bottom, which indicate which of the three screens you're viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fill up each of the homescreens with as many widgets as you like and assign a wallpaper that spans the three screens. Widgets are mini-applications that you can use to customize your home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets are tucked in a tray on the left side of the screen by default. Once you open the tray, all you need to do is drag them to a place on the screen where you would like them to be. If you decide that you no longer need a widget just drag it back to the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widgets are handy like the AccuWeather widget that shows the local weather and a clock with two time zones. There are widgets that simply serve as shortcuts to an application and the good thing about them is that you don't even need to drag them out - a tap on a widget in the tray will launch the app too. So, if you carefully select which widgets to be in the tray, you can use it as a simple menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download new widgets and change the settings for network access. This is something to keep in mind - some widgets need to download data from the Internet (weather forecast, news feeds, etc.). It's not large chunks of data but it can still involve data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star widget here is the Eco Walk widget. It works with the Eco walk app and can be used to start a new walk, showing you the number of steps and some stats at the end of the walk. Stats include how many calories you've burned, how much fuel you've saved (and how much CO2 emissions the trip would have produced if you drove). The units for this calculation are the number of trees saved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blue Earth uses the rearranged main menu we saw in the Jet and Pixon12. It stretches over three different screens which are sweep-scrollable sideways. The reason that so much more space was needed is the fact that almost all apps are now brought to the main menu, arranged in a flat iPhone-like structure and you will only need to dig deeper for the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick between four different themes for the menu and you can also assign a custom background. The image selected sits slightly dimmed in the background so that it doesn't interfere with the icons and hurt usability. You can remove some of the shortcuts or bring back ones you've removed; you can also rearrange them and even rename the three screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In both the main menu and the homescreen, you have a button bar at the bottom that features three virtual keys - keypad, phonebook and a button to toggle between the homescreen and menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth, like most recent Samsung phones, comes complete with multitasking. The task manager gets launched by pressing and holding the hardware Back key. It's not as nice as the one in the Jet, both in terms of aesthetics and functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "task manager" is actually two different and unrelated screens - the first, which you get most of the time, is just five shortcuts which allow you to switch between the native phone functions. The other - which you can only get if you press and hold the menu key with a Java app currently on the screen - allows you to switch between and terminate Java applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is very annoying as minimizing a Java app to get to the native functions means you have to open the "Games and more" menu to get back to the Java application, even if it's just to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blue Earth phone features Samsung's Smart unlock, which allows users to not only unlock the phone but open a menu item or an application, or even dial a contact, just by drawing a letter on the unlock screen. Each letter from A to Z can be set to trigger one of those actions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lock however is different. It's called Eco unlock and is in tune with the message of the phone. To unlock, you need to pick up a discarded soda can and throw it in the trashcan next to it. Eco unlock is not as functional as the Smart unlock or as quick as the regular unlock, but it does neatly reinforce the phone's central mantra - "recycle".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other eco-related bits and pieces in Blue Earth's TouchWiz include the Eco mode, which sets the display backlight to more conservative settings. This is perhaps not very useful, but when you change the backlight settings, a message informs you that Eco mode has been turned off. We couldn't help but feel a little guilty when we cranked up the backlight to maximum, so this might keep people from using the maximum setting. Before you know it, this attitude will extend to air-conditioners too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other feature (for which we couldn't quite find an explanation) is the Eco profile, which changes the ringtone to "Eco chirrup". Eco chirrup (there's also "Eco chirp") is a high-pitched chirp, which is rather annoying (to say the least). It might be because the ear-piercing chirps are easier to hear even at a lower volume, but the energy savings are probably not worth the torture.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook doing fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth comes with a phonebook that can store up to 2000 contacts with multiple fields. You can assign a photo to each contact, or even a video if you so wish. You can view contacts in the phone memory, the SIM card, or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blue Earth offers three different search patterns for the phonebook. The first is the traditional search by typing a part of the contact's name. It doesn't work all that well with the virtual keyboards however. You have one extra click to open the text box to type and only after you tap 'Done' do you get to see the search results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we ended up using the alphabetic scroll most of the time. Quite nicely, Samsung have provided the option to place the scroll bar on either side of the screen to facilitate single-hand usage for both left and right-handed users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the kinetic scrolling is also available in the search but it's not quite as convenient in longer contact lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook doesn't display the contact photos and offers only a Call button, unlike the Jet, which also had a Send Message button. Still, there's a good reason to assign photos to the contacts aside from Caller ID. It's called Photo contacts and we'll take a look at it in the next section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact there are first and last name fields along with a field for the display name. So you can have a contact appear by his nickname while still keeping the contact's full name on record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful feature to avoid duplicate entries is that the phone will display a warning if the number for the new contact you just entered is already in the phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo contacts shows off your contacts' photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo contacts app in the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth keeps tabs on the contacts you talk to most often. It displays an arc of photos (the contacts' photos) with a name and number next to them. The contacts are sorted in order of most recently called and tapping a contact brings up buttons to call, video call, send a message to or delete a contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth is more than just a phone but the added features do not come at the expense of its main job - making calls. Reception was strong with excellent voice quality during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer gets activated through its shortcut on the homescreen or from the main menu. You can proceed to dial just like you would on any other phone. Unfortunately the smart dial feature works with numbers only, instead of names, which makes it pretty useless. When you punch in some digits, the contacts whose numbers contain them pop up but we doubt it anyone really remembers just a part of a contact's number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with most recent Samsungs, the Blue Earth phone has a nice accelerometer-based telephony feature. It allows you to mute the ringtone of an incoming call (or ringing alarm) by turning it face down. The other call-related trick from the Samsung Jet - Speaker Call - is missing. It automatically activated the speakerphone when you placed the phone on a level surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7550 Blue Earth doesn't have a proximity sensor to automatically turns off the display when you hold it next to your ear, so instead it just locks the screen - if you need to access something while on a call, you need to unlock it first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New events like missed calls or incoming messages show up on the homescreen as a widget. It has three tabs each signaling a different type of event. It also displays the sender's number and the time of the call or text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the Samsung Blue Earth comes complete with a reject list option that allows you to selectively block numbers you don't want to receive calls or messages from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the loudspeaker performance, here is how the S7550 ranks alongside some of the other devices we've measured. You can find more details about the test itself, as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging needs automatic setting detection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth messaging department is an exact copy of what we saw on the Samsung S8000 Jet. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS editor is the familiar intuitive application which allows you to add the recipient from your phonebook, from your recent contacts or punch it in manually. You can also add a whole group in the recipient field for mass messages, instead of adding contacts one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messages can be broken down into up to 15 chunks for sending if you exceed their maximum character limit (standard 160).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice green feature allows you to add an Eco day to your message. It inserts a text template containing the date and a short background of the selected green day. Quite handy if you want to tell all your contact what they should be celebrating today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email support is also duly covered. There's a Gmail icon in the Google menu but all it does is open the gmail.com webpage in your browser. You might as well use it if you prefer web-based access but the native email client seems the far better option to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The greatest problem we had with it is that it didn't automatically detect the settings for Gmail so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, handling email is a breeze. Still most other brands are already providing some automatic configurations for the email clients on their handsets and maybe it's about time Samsung did something about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email download limit is 5MB, enough for receiving most types of files. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth has support for typing on a customary (albeit virtual) 3 x 4 alphanumeric keypad. Unfortunately, the unit we used for this review did not come with the finalized software and the QWERTY keyboard didn't work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File browser browses with the best of them<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its pedigree, the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth is equipped with one of the most elaborate file managers you can find on a feature phone. It can display the files and folders on the phone memory or the memory card, and even both at once with matching folders nicely brought together. The phone uses predefined photos to keep media organized, but you're free to use your own folders as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy, move files or send them over Bluetooth - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except the default folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 handles memory cards very well, and even initialization and reading of a 16GB card doesn't take too long.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and Photo browser can do one-finger zoom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like its more imaging-savvy siblings, the S7550 Blue Earth has two different picture galleries. They are both optimized for touch operation and are very user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and accessing it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images. It allows sorting your images by date, type, name, and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers grid and list layouts but no zig-zag view like in the Jet. The zig-zag view was the more visually elaborate one, but this gallery serves a more organizational purpose - for a proper viewing experience, head to the Photo browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going through photos is quite fast with the S7550, we're delighted with the image browsing speed. Once you open an individual image, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next images without having to return to the image list. Alternating portrait and landscape modes is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also implemented the so-called one-finger zooming, which compensates for the lack of multitouch functionality, though some might say it's a better way to zoom altogether. Zooming is extra simple and takes only a single move of your thumb - you just need to hold it on the screen for a second and then drag up or down for zooming in or out. This method works in both galleries (as well as the web browser).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alternative to the picture gallery is the Photo browser. Photos can be arranged by date (the default setting), by file name or the more intriguing option "by color".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the two galleries also have another Samsung proprietary accelerometer-based feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone up and down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player does a bang up job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth is exactly the same as in the S5230 and hasn't been much altered from the M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a dedicated widget, allowing quick access to the full version of the application with only a single tap. You can also start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, etc. but it also packs three extra options - widening, dynamic and surround effects. It doesn't offer custom presets though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized to include fast forward and rewind, just like on the S5230. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth also features an FM radio with RDS, which offers intuitive controls. It can be opened from the main menu or for more immediate access you can use the Radio widget on the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on it brings up the radio or you can just use the widget's controls to start/stop the radio or change the station. It can only skip between saved stations though, and if you want to search you'll have to do it in the actual app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stations, you can save stations but they are labeled just by their frequency and you can't rename them. There's a separate list for your favorite stations though. Find Music doesn't work with the radio and radio recording is also missing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio output of the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth is good, albeit hardly spectacular. There are no deal-breakers anywhere in its performance but it didn't manage to achieve any records either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level and dynamic range readings are excellent even at this stage, while the stereo crosstalk is passable at least. The distortion levels are slightly higher than those of some competitors but there's nothing too disturbing about them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the table and the graph so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player covers the basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface without too many features. All the basic are covered though, and that should really be enough as the screen size doesn't really lend itself to watching whole movies on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MPEG-4 videos but we only managed to get QVGA samples running. The VGA resolution videos we tried playing turned out to be unsupported. The video player can also use the accelerometer so once you flip the phone to its side it goes landscape and fullscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel fixed-focus shooter does well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth features a 3.15 megapixel camera with fixed focus and is capable of taking photos with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does not have auto-focus, but it sports the nice Smile shot feature. Basically when you turn it on, pushing the camera button doesn't immediately take a picture. Instead it just starts monitoring the framed face and as soon as the person smiles (or at least grins), the handset takes the shot for you automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly one of the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the Blue Earth phone is pretty basic but shows some pretty mature image processing. The contrast is good, the noise levels are tolerable, while fine detail smearing is by far not as frequent as it was on the Samsung Star. The images from the Blue Earth are sharper, which comes at the cost of oversharpening in some areas. The color rendering has improved as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall result is quite good for a basic camera though it certainly won't cut it as your main camera. You can see that for yourselves from the samples below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities of the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth are very poor - it maxes out at QVGA resolution and frame rate somewhere below 15 fps. Needless to say that hardly any usable videos can be produced with those specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample Samsung S7550 video recording for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3G connectivity more than welcomed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 is usable worldwide with quad-band GSM support. It also packs 3G support at the 2100 band and with HSDPA it's perfectly ready for speedy network data transfers. Anything data-intensive also has the option to go through Wi-Fi, which is a welcome but surprise addition to the connectivity specs for the Blue Earth - Wi-Fi is not what we'd call "energy efficient".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is present and it is complemented by A2DP support, making up somewhat for the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Blue Earth comes with garden variety microUSB port, unlike the S5230 Star, which was stuck back in time with a proprietary port. You can set up the phone to connect in mass storage mode or PC suite mode (or Media player) or to prompt each time it's paired with a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In mass storage mode it gives access to the memory card but not to the internal memory and you cannot use the phone for calls or data in this mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser might be changed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There was something fishy going on with the web browser of the Blue Earth unit we got - it was a NetFront 3.4, which is something we haven't seen for a while. Since the software in our unit wasn't finalized, we can't be sure this is the browser the phone is going to ship with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We certainly can't think of any reasons not to replace it with the excellent WebKit-based Dolfin browser, which was cooked in-house by Samsung. There was something wrong with the NetFront browser, as it showed too many rendering issues, ones we haven't seen before on the same browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, one-finger zoom and kinetic scrolling are enabled in the browser, which is nice, but the Flash support is very basic so don't count on YouTube support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps are sociable and eco-friendly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth has the typical time-management applications - Calendar, alarms, to-do list, memo application. Tools like a calculator, world time application, countdown timer and stopwatch are included, as well as a voice recorder and unit converter. The calendar is mostly unchanged, except for the addition of several permanent events - the Eco day list. It's a list of eco holidays, which show up as events in the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an RSS reader and an application caller "Communities". It helps you upload data to content sharing sites like YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, MySpace, Picasa and a few others. It will automatically resize images and has a handy account manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other apps are familiar enough, so we won't go into details. Just remember that there are widgets that do some of those tasks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung S7550 comes with an office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files. It's an application developed by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the software package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The documents viewer is quick enough when opening files; however, panning is rather slow. The document viewer also works in landscape mode (rotating the screen automatically), which makes reading a little easier. The excellent one-finger zoom is a great addition here and is much more comfortable than the default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The corporate types among you will be happy to know there's Exchange ActiveSync support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Eco walk application is part of the eco-image of the phone. It's a step counter with a green twist - when you input some info about yourself, it will calculate how many calories you've burned, how much CO2 would have gone into the atmosphere if you drove a car instead of walked and how many trees you've saved by choosing to walk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app keeps a history of all your eco-walks displaying the number of steps for each and one of the other statistics. This turns it into a sort of game appealing to your competitive spirit to try to beat your previous "high score". Of course, there's a complementary widget, which makes starting eco-walks easier.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Proper GPS software missed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the Samsung Blue Earth has built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS, which puts it up there with high-end phones but all you're getting from it is geo-tagging and what you can coax out of Google Maps. So much for our dreams of solar-powered satellite navigation in case we ever went off-roading.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Game department is rather poor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of Samsung recently, the S7550 offers plenty of games but just one is a full version, the others are trials. The full game is called Party Island, which is more like a game and a half since it includes a demo version of the Party Island game. Leaving the demo aside, in Bubble Popper, as the name suggests, you have to pop all bubbles before they reach you. The title doesn't make it sound very tempting but if you have time to kill, it's an enjoyable way to do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trials include well-known titles from other Samsung phones. Here's the list: Asphalt 4 (a racing game), Brain Challenge (several puzzles), BrickBreaker (BreakOut clone), Diamond Twister (think Jawbreaker on WinMo), DJ Mix Tour (rhythm game like Guitar Hero for DJ's) and finally PyramidBloxx. Some of the games rely on a virtual D-pad, which isn't very comfortable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, will the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth usher in a new age in the design of mobile phones? Well, fully solar-powered phones are still years away but both chips and solar panels are getting more efficient by the day. The plastic used on the phone is top notch, and we know many people would love to hear it's been recycled (most of it anyway).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, it's hard not to like even the box of this phone. It can be turned into a photo frame or a pen stand for example and that's a trend we'd like to see continue. Not that a pen stand is exactly essential but a clever way to make the packaging useful is a great idea - nothing goes to waste, plus you get one extra thing in the box? though well, not exactly in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Barring third party solutions, mobile phones that pack a solar panel are quite rare. The Samsung S7550 Blue Earth jumps in the deep - but it gives you the novelty of solar power without sacrificing features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's just a touchscreen bar you're after, well there's plenty to choose from. Just keep in mind that none will offer a feature that makes them unique and makes you responsible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5530 XpressMusic is quite affordable and will match most of the Blue Earth's features. What it lacks is a GPS receiver (and a solar panel of course), but install the free Nokia Maps, pair it with a Bluetooth GPS unit and you're ready to go. Of course, you can also trade up to Nokia 5800 XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 5530 XpressMusic ? Nokia 5800 XpressMusic </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ones that flaunt eco-friendliness do so at the cost of features. The Samsung E1107 Crest Solar has the solar panel, but that's pretty much all it has. The Motorola W233 Renew on the other hand is made from recycled plastic and is carbon neutral, but again - it's very basic.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Sure, the solar panel of the Samsung S7550 Blue Earth alone isn't enough to power the phone and will only top up the battery if it's running low and you're away from a charger. This may not sound like much to some, but do not underestimate the statement it makes - recycling and renewable energy are things many people care about deeply. In the end, the Blue Earth may not be the Toyota Prius of mobile phones but it marks an important shift. It's not fully environmentally friendly just yet, but it's perhaps environmentally aware enough to start making a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That takes us back where we started actually. Looking up the Eco Day list in the Samsung Blue Earth calendar, we guess Samsung may try and rush things to launch the handset in time for the 28th of September[*].</paragraph>
			<paragraph>* 28th September is Green Consumer day</paragraph>
