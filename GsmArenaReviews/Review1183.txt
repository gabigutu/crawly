			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GSMArena Labs are tests designed to give an objective account of how a device performs in real-world scenarios. In short, it's about what you can expect from a gadget you're planning to buy. Our tests are constantly being developed and refined to keep up with the latest emerging technology. We aim to give you real results, avoiding convoluted technical jargon, so you can easily compare all tested devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are offering a detailed look into the specifics behind out testing process, including what we test, why we test it, and how we go about the whole thing. While it provides enough technical information should you require it, we've tried to cover each subject in a way so as not to confuse the inexperienced reader, and the following pages a great place to get introduced to any of these topics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In brief, here is an overview of our various testing routines. Clicking on any of the tests below will take you to its respective page, where more detailed information can be found.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With displays, it is easy to get caught in the hype as technology buzzwords are meant to grab your attention rather than describe the actual screen quality. Super AMOLED, HD-IPS, Super LCD, Retina IPS and whatnot, each claim to offer the best image quality around, but usually find it unnecessary to provide specific numbers, which would make technologies easier to compare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the rare occasions that display specs are actually quoted, the numbers are purposely chosen to be misleading and make the real-life performance seem much better than it really is. Which is where our first test comes in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the most important factor when it comes to screen quality is contrast ratio. Contrast ratio is the measure of the dynamic range of the luminance of the display, essentially describing how much darker the deepest blacks are than the brightest whites. A display with a good contrast ratio is able to show richer, more vibrant still images and videos that come to life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness of a given object is measured in candela (cd), which is the scientific unit for luminance. One candela--which stands for candle in Latin--is the equivalent of the light intensity of one candle as perceived by the human eye. For displays, light is measured per square meter of surface area (cd/m2), which is sometimes also referred to as Nits (nt).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast ratio itself is determined by measuring the cd/m2 of a pure white screen, and dividing it by the cd/m2 of a pure black screen (note that on an LCD a pure black screen is not the same as a screen which is turned off, because even black pixels emit some light). So, a display which has 100 cd/m2 of whites and 1 cd/m2 of blacks will have a contrast ratio of about 100:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important note about AMOLEDs is due here. As AMOLED units have the ability to completely switch off individual pixels, their black level readings are 0, which gives them an infinite contrast ratio under the testing conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we measure we take two readings off each device - first with the display brightness set to 50% and then with the brightness setting pushed all the way up. We test the handsets in complete darkness, because when ambient light is present, the luminance levels of the blacks displayed goes up, and affects the perceived contrast ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast ratio is very heavily influenced by the black levels of a display. While a brighter display would normally have an advantage, it will usually be unable to compensate for insufficiently deep blacks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight legibility<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While having a good quality display is important, the reflectivity of the screen is not to be neglected. After all, you rarely use your smartphone in complete darkness, so there's little use of having a premium screen that turns into a mirror in bright environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our sunlight legibility test aims to show you how legible each screen remains in bright environments, where screen reflectivity matters as much as its natural contrast and brightness. We use fixed studio lighting to simulate sunlight falling on the phone screens and measure the contrast ratio of each of them, when faced with this powerful light source. We measure each display with brightness turned up to 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The perceived sunlit contrast ratio is then calculated based on the values of the blacks and whites visible on the display. The higher the value here, the more visible the screen in bright sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And before you start asking for a "real life" test (typical indoor lighting), you should know that contrast loss is linear, so you should be able to make out the usual performance as an average of the two scores we provide. Our test is obviously based on two extremes: the pitch black room and the bright outdoors. Adding something in between wouldn't make much sense, as there's no standard for how bright a home or office is.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Speakerphone loudness test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A loudspeaker that is nice and... well, loud, is a nice asset for your mobile. Whether it's hearing the other person on the speakerphone or your phone ringing from the other room, or even playing music on your get-together's, a loud speaker is definitely something that's nice to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the quality of the loudspeaker sound is difficult to measure and is for the most part a subjective matter, we can effectively measure how loud it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this, we use a digital noise/loudness meter which measures the peak loudness of the phones and tablets we review, in decibels (dB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do our tests in a soundproof studio taking measurements with the handset loudspeaker facing the loudness meter at a distance of exactly 1 m. For each test we make several consecutive measurements - we usually disregard the highest readings and take the lowest of the maximum values, as that's least likely to have been misread. We test three different types of audio samples for three different scenarios:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1) A phone ringing. For the first part of the test we use a ringtone which resembles the ringing of an old rotary phone, because it seems that most phones do well when we use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2) Pink noise. Next we try a sample of pink noise. Our readings with it are pretty indicative on how well the handset loudspeaker can play most music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3) Human voice, male. This is an important test, since if you tend the use the loudspeaker for speakerphone purposes, loudness is really important, regardless of whether you are in the conference room or in your car.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once we have the results in db for all three sound samples, we sum them up and use a in-house developed formula to produce a qualitative description of the loudness levels: Below Average, Average, Good, Very Good and Excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As many of our results are separated by a difference of only a few decibels, it is important to keep in mind that the decibel is a logarithmic unit, which means that a reading of +3dB represents roughly two times the power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd like to reiterate again that this test is not about the quality of the sound produced by the loudspeaker. A mild, relatively deep-sounding loudspeaker that soothes the ear won't do well in this test. Instead, what we are after is pure peak loudness - it's our hunt for the loudest phone, ever.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio Quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The series of audio quality tests we perform measure how well a device is able to reproduce sound, based on a scientific approach rather than our own subjective opinion. Keep in mind that these tests do not take into account any retail headsets that come with the device. We use the same pair of AKG headphones when we test the output with headphones attached to the phone to even up the field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, we put special test tracks on the device and play them through the audio output jack to our M-Audio Fast Track Pro external audio interface. This rig has has decent enough capabilities to test even the highest quality portable music players. You can find its quick Line Input specs here, if you are the audiophile type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we run the resulting recordings through the RightMark Audio Analyzer (RMAA) software, which does all the analyzing fro us..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the beginning of every test, RMAA generates a calibration sound in order to set the correct input levels. Then we play a special test tone (again, generated by RMAA) which allows the software to evaluate the signal captured real time with the M-Audio Fast Track Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We test all handsets we review on how they perform at the maximum volume level. We disable all available equalizer settings and sound enhancements that the handset music players may be equipped with. All this gives us the opportunity to create a controlled environment, which should produce accurate and comparable results throughout the tested phones and tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RMAA software produces results on several important measurable areas of sound quality. These are frequency response, noise (signal-to-noise ratio), dynamic range, harmonic and intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk. Typically, high-quality sound should have high signal to noise, low distortion and cross-channel interference, an accurate frequency response, as well as high dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frequency response is used to indicate the accuracy of amplifiers and speakers in reproducing audio, and is a measurement of how much sound deviates (in decibels dB) at a given frequency (in Hertz Hz). As an example, a high fidelity amplifier may have a frequency response of 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz ±1 dB. This means that the system amplifies all bands from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz with a maximum positive or negative deviation of 1 dB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is this deviation that we look at when evaluating frequency response. In our tables, you will see two numbers listed under frequency response--the highest positive and negative deviations of the sound produced across all audible frequencies. The closer each of these numbers is to 0, the better the frequency response of the device. Lower absolute numbers also mean the handset treats all sounds equally; it won't impose its will on the music but will allow you to hear it as it was recorded, which is what a good piece of audio equipment should do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also include a graph which shows exactly what sort of sound deviations occur at the various frequencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As shown in the graph, the frequency response tests are performed twice. The first time when plugged into an active amplifier--the same as what you'd expect when plugging it into your car stereo or home audio system--while the second run is done with headphones attached, as the added resistance oftentimes makes the audio quality output slightly worse. As mentioned above, we use the same pair of AKG headphones with an impedance of 32 ohms for each of these second runs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good frequency response does not necessarily guarantee a high level of audio fidelity, but rather how well a piece of equipment meets the basic frequency response requirements. It's important to note that larger deviations below 40 Hz or above 15 kHz should not be counted, being beyond the audible rage of the human ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise levels of a given device are usually measured in relation to the signal levels, otherwise known as the signal-to-noise ratio. In less technical terms, the signal-to-noise ratio compares the level of a desired signal (such as music) to the level of background noise ('background' meaning unwanted interference created by the equipment). So, the higher the signal-to-noise ratio (the further this value is away from 0), the less obtrusive the background noise is, meaning the audio equipment is of a higher quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic range is the measure of how well a given device is able to play both loud and quiet sounds simultaneously. The human sense of hearing has a very high dynamic range; a person is capable of hearing anything from a quiet murmur in a soundproofed room to the sound of the loudest rock concert. A difference like this can be up to 100dB. However, a person cannot perform these feats of perception at both extremes of the scale simultaneously - you cannot hear a whisper in a noisy street, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, a good quality audio reproduction system should be able to reproduce accurately both the quiet and loud sounds at the same time. This dynamic range of an audio device is also sometimes referred to as the dynamic window. To mathematically determine a dynamic range you must take the difference between the ceiling (the loudest sound) and the noise floor (the quietest sound) of an audio device. For example, if the ceiling of a device is 10 dB and the floor is 3 dB, then the dynamic range is 7 dB, since 10 - 3 = 7. So, the higher the value in the dynamic range field, the better the device is at reproducing quiet and loud sounds simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Total harmonic distortion (THD) and the intermodulation distortion (IMD) measure the unwanted altering of the original audio signal. When an audio signal passes through a non-ideal, non-linear device (such as your smartphone), additional content is added to the original frequencies in the form of interference, which results in distortion. Distortion is the name given to anything that alters a pure input signal in any way. So, as you might have guessed, the lower the number in either of these fields, the better the audio output of your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo crosstalk is a measurement of the interference between the two audio channels of a given device. All modern digital audio players feature two distinct analogue channels for audio (left and right) to match the stereo recordings, but most often a certain degree of inter-channel interference can occur. The stereo crosstalk measurement determines the amount of signal leaking from one channel to the other. In purely non-technical terms, this rating measures how good the stereo effect is. The larger this value is (the further away from zero), the better the quality of the sound coming from each channel.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera compare tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Photo/Video Compare tools are designed to give you an idea of how well a given camera performs in real-life conditions, and how it stacks up against its peers. Being able to look at the images produced by up to three devices side-by-side is immensely helpful in figuring out how good a given cameraphone actually is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we still take "real-life" outdoor photos with all of the devices we review (which you can check out in the reviews themselves), those are frequently at the mercy of the weather, and not as easy to reproduce all year round as we would like. That's why we designed this test to be as objective as possible - all samples are taken in controlled conditions in our studio, at the same time of day under the same lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tools allow you to judge a cameraphone's performance not only in terms of resolved detail, but also image processing (noise reduction, sharpening) and camera lens distortion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Photo Compare Tool, you'll be able to choose from one of three different charts, and up to three devices to compare. Each device is listed with its native resolution, but you can scale all the sample photos to see how cameras of different resolutions compare against each other. A good 8MP camera, for instance, will typically be sharper when scaled down to 5MP, but sometimes the lower-res camera will win out when you equalize the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPhone 4S in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Video Compare Tool allows you to compare still frames taken from videos captured with the phone. We've set up two test scenarios: one under normal lighting conditions and one under low-light to give you an idea of how the handsets fare in different environments. The motion in the Ferris wheels will allow you to see how much fine detail survives the post-processing, as well as the compression levels, noise levels and so on. Of course, a still frame doesn't tell the whole story - there's also framerate, rolling shutter effects and other considerations which the tool doesn't cover, but it's still a good starting point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have our resolution chart shot on video. It shows how much of the available resolution is retained when shooting video. Just like in the Photo Compare Tool, the three charts are accessed by clicking on their names below the main sample image. Other tested devices are listed alongside their natively supported video recording resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N9 in the Video Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For both tools, at the bottom of each device selection field you'll find a list of reference cameras available, which allow you to see how a particular cameraphone compares to a professional DSLR unit, such as our in-house Canon EOS 5D Mark II. You'd be surprised at how well certain cameraphones stack up against these heavy hitters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that only devices reviewed after November 2010 will have compare tests available, and only cameras with 720p video recording and higher will have video compare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info about video and photo compare can be found on the tool pages themselves, or you can check out the following section of our video site tour.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In gauging battery life, it's hard to perfect a methodology that lets you cover all of the various use scenarios without having to test for weeks on end. Whether it be display, audio quality, or camera, the goal with all of our tests is not only to provide you with the clearest, most comprehensive examination of a particular device, but also to provide it to you promptly. Our battery test is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With each battery test you'll see four different numbers, each reflecting a different type of battery-consuming activities. The test revolves around three fundamental tasks, which we feel are most commonly performed by smartphone users: making calls, browsing the web and playing video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test is the talk time test, which measures how long it takes to deplete the battery by making voice calls. Bearing in mind that most screens automatically turn off during a call, we've made sure our set up accounts for this. We close all applications which may further strain the battery, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browsing test is performed using an automated script which reloads a webpage every ten seconds. There are no flash elements on the web pages, so the playing field is even. The brightness of the phones' displays is set to 50% and we use a 802.11n access point placed a few meters away to get full connectivity bars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our video playback test we measure how long it takes for a device to run its fully charged battery down to 10%, while looping a standard-definition video. We stop at 10% since most devices shut their video players at this point. The display is again set to 50%, and all radios on the device are switched off (Airplane mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update Jan 29, 2016: By popular user request we're changing the brightness level at which we conduct our battery tests to a fixed value. Whereas before we would set the brightness slider midway on the phone's brightness slider, which worked out to a relatively random brightness number, we would now aim for a fixed level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of 200nits, which we've chosen for our tests, has become somewhat of an industry standard for indoor use in daylight. But more importantly, it's both the median and average value of the brightness levels at which we've tested all reviewed devices so far. This means that our previous battery life test results will remain comparable and equally relevant as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, our Endurance rating gives you an idea of how much battery backup you can get from a single charge. A score of 40h means that you'll need to fully charge once every 40 hours if you do one hour of 3G calls, one hour of video playback and one hour of web browsing daily. Essentially, it's an aggregated and normalized score, which factors in the three mentioned tests along with the real-life standby power consumption, which we also measure. Such usage scenario may not match your own so you may get out a different endurance out of a particular phone. However, we've devised this pattern so that we can compare devices and estimate the differences in their battery life from a comparative point of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update March 28, 2014: To meaningfully compare battery life across devices, we've released a new tool, the Battery life test table. It contains all the data from the tests we've conducted so far and lets you sort the phones by their overall endurance rating or one of the three test components ? call time, web browsing and video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tool lets you set custom times for browsing the web, talking and watching video so they reflect how you actually use your device, rather than sticking to our pre-defined pattern.</paragraph>
