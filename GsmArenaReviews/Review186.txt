			<paragraph>The LG KC910 has a moniker that sends out a bold and clear statement about talent. Packing a whopping 8 megapixel camera and top-of-the-line video recording, the LG KC910 Renoir is all about capturing the moment, leaving an impression. While this alone should be enough to assert an identity, the Renoir just won't stop there. With the full touch user interface and the portly 3" display, everything is a mere touch away. Wi-Fi, HSDPA and GPS are all aboard to add the last bits of oomph to the feature-loaded LG Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exciting facts and figures from the Renoir specs sheet however won't really give away its real-life performance and this is where we step in. We already had the camera performance of the LG Renoir to bits in our 8 megapixel cameraphone shootout but it's time to move up and look at the bigger picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It certainly took us quite some time to bring this review forward. Perhaps we even pushed it over the peak of your anticipation, but we didn't mean to get you starved so you like the meal better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our better-late-than-never department - duly sent to the corner, by the way - has finally prepared a full-featured, action-packed and hopefully eye-opening review of one of the best imaging mobile phones this year - the LG KC910 Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir is among the few 8 megapixel cameraphones that are already on the market and chances are you have been eyeing it big time for this year's holiday shopping - especially if you are into big touchscreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It builds on the Viewty popularity but does walk its own path, adding a number of innovations to the equation. The feel and overall experience is different - and better - with LG Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess we're looking at one of the most obvious rivalries in the game. The main competitor of the Renoir full-featured multimedia package is no other than Samsung Pixon. Both share the touchscreen form factor and will probably appeal to the same kind of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing between them is a tough call. The Pixon has more camera-centric looks and is certainly a match for the Renoir imaging skill. Both have similar price tags and, while the Pixon lacks Wi-Fi connectivity, it makes up some with slightly bigger screen estate, better widgets, WVGA video recording and quad-band GSM support (which most Renoirs on the market reportedly lack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we have it duly covered, it's only fair for the competition to clear the stage for today's headliner - the LG KC910 Renoir. Jump to the next page for more on looks and handling.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KC910 Renoir 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir is slim enough for the power offered and by no means does it feel heavy at 114 g. In terms of girth, it loses the slimmest 8 megapixel cameraphone mark by a mere notch to Samsung Pixon. However, the difference is so small it hardly gets noticed, especially with that bulging camera grip of the Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just to give you a size perspective, LG Renoir is about the same size as the LG KU990 Viewty, but about 5mm taller. They even weigh pretty much the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the LG Renoir includes a charger, USB cable, stylus dongle, stereo headset with a 3.5mm audio jack adapter and an 8 GB memory card (market dependent as usual).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stylus dongle may come in handy for those of you that are into handwriting. Thanks to the touch-friendly interface, it's otherwise pretty much redundant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KC910 Renoir has a subdued and conservative styling, which however looks and talks shop. The high-quality materials used and the sharp shiny finish add to a really nice first impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost the whole front panel of the LG Renoir is taken by the 3" touchscreen with a resolution of 240 x 400 pixels. It has a subtle mirror finish and is generally the same as the one in the LG Viewty. That means it offers nice picture quality but visibility suffers under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there is a video-call camera and an ambient light sensor that allows the Renoir to dynamically adapt screen brightness to the ambient lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware keys. Those are the red and green call keys, which are on either side of the special shortcut key that opens an application launcher and the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few months back, when we saw the first images of the device, the buttons below the display did come out rather cheap looking. Now that we have it in our hands, we're glad to be proven wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two camera controls on the LG Renoir, placed on the right hand side of the device. The shutter key also starts the camera, while the image stabilization key does its gimmick in low light situations. The "daily" purpose of the latter is to lock/unlock the screen and keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, digital image stabilization is way behind the efficiency of its optical counterpart, so we find that a rarely used feature that hardly deserves its own dedicated shortcut key. We would have preferred it if it started the Macro mode or toggled the Scene presets instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is a pleasure to use, with soft but distinct half press. The irregular bulge makes it very tactile. The volume rocker, which is all the way up on that right-hand side, is equally user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Renoir there is the universal connectivity port and the microSD slot. Both are covered by plastic caps to keep dust off. The connectivity port is used for all your cabling needs, while the location of the hot-swappable microSD card slot grants hassle-free access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the LG Renoir with a 8GB microSD card and it worked flawlessly. User reports suggest it's capable of handling 16GB cards too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing lacking in terms of connectivity is a 3.5mm standard audio jack, but the provided headset adapter takes care of that. You can use your favorite headphones with the Renoir, while still getting to keep the mic and the Send/End key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Renoir is where it gets more interesting. The camera lens is right in the middle of an impressive bulging ring that really looks the part. Unlike the LG Viewty, there is no multi-functional slider here. Instead, you rotate the outer part of the ring to open or close the camera lens cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safeguarding the high-quality lens is a really practical decision, but it's implementation might have been better. For example, the ribbed ring provides way too little grip and you can easily find yourself struggling with it to open the lens cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Renoir sports manual focus too, but it's operated via a software slider on-screen instead of the lens ring. That may as well be irrelevant, as we find both solutions equally uncomfortable to use on a regular basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the camera lens there is the xenon flash and a focus assist light. There is no LED flash to use as video light or a torch. It's no biggie, point-n-shoot cameras lack that too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, as it turned out in our 8 megapixel cameraphone shootout, the Renoir xenon flash is a bit underpowered and there are issues with automatic exposure when you use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom and top part of the LG Renoir lack any controls at all. On the top however you can spot the back cover release key dead center and the lanyard eyelet right on the edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover reveals the 1000 mAh battery and the SIM card bed. As to battery performance, LG commit to 264 h of standby time and up to 3 h of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite complaints with poor battery life by some users, our Renoir managed 6 days in standby mode on a single charge - used quite sparingly, of course. In serious use - intensive but still no extremes - you're looking at 3 to 4 days of power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the battery life of the Renoir seems pretty much identical to LG Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, we also noticed that heavy use of the camera tends to drain the battery more quickly than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the LG KC910 Renoir easily fits in hand and, as far as we are concerned, it's a pleasure to work with. It's remarkably compact for the rich multimedia capabilities it offers, it's got an excellent build quality and finish, with commendable ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A fresh touch to the user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Renoir has the latest Flash-based touch user interface by LG. The first time we saw that was in LG Viewty, and it even got jazzed up with the LG KF700 (although stripped of some features to reflect its downmarket positioning).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir boasts an even more advanced UI version with quite some little tweaks noticeable throughout. We'll be glad to share those with you, as we go on to check what the user interface of the latest 8 megapixel cameraphone offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, LG Cookie seems to offer even more new features, but we are yet to see those in action. For now, the LG Renoir interface is the most advanced touch UI we've seen by LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a lot more animations now, scrolling is much smoother and more Apple iPhone. For example, when you get to the bottom of a scrolling list, the items don't just stop rolling, but bounce and throb to your sweeps with almost physical elasticity. As expected, every touch is accompanied by a short vibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only drawback we noticed is that the interface tends to be a bit slow, every operation involving a bit of lag. It's not really a big deal, and some probably won't even notice it. But truth be told, the competing Samsung Pixon feels snappier compared to the LG Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's start with the new stuff. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a wider choice of desktop widgets now to put on your homescreen, and they are easier to control. A touch on the W icon on the homescreen activates the Widgets bar - choose the ones you want and hide the ones you don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among those there is a Weather widget, which continuously retrieves information about your local weather. There is also a Contacts widgets, which offers an image-based quick dial pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting note is that when the active widgets on your screen become too many, you can fluidly scroll them right on your home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new widgets system has a slight imperfection - the currently active widgets take some time to appear on the Home screen each time you wake up the device and that can be nagging if you just want to see the time for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And truth be told, Samsung seem to have a nicer choice of widgets with their TouchWiz interface on the Samsung Pixon. Plus you can even download new widgets in various languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the other updates of the interface is that the main menu items are no longer fixed - upon a longer press you can move the icons around and reposition them within the grid - much like on the Apple iPhone, but without the wiggling. The Samsung Pixon for example, doesn't offer that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the LG Renoir interface auto rotates when you turn the handset to landscape mode. The feature works selectively and is only available when you're typing a message, browsing images, watching a video or viewing documents. Rotation is smooth and the phone reacts promptly to your movement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are of course many other changes and, though less significant, they will get mentioned along the way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All the basics are covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For those of you that meet the LG Flash interface for the first time, we'll also cover the basics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the LG Renoir homescreen you will find a navigation bar with shortcuts sitting at the bottom of the screen - just as in the Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four available shortcuts are not user configurable. The first shortcut takes you to the Dial pad to punch in a number, the second opens the Contacts list, the third one opens the Messaging submenu, and the last one takes you to the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside all that, the user interface of the LG Renoir retains the same menu system as the LG Viewty - simple, yet nicely elaborate and functional. LG have made a really nice job designing the user interface and we like that they are improving it with every new handset they release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of four tabs - they are displayed in a column on the right-hand side of the screen. They don't have names but the first one is related to making calls and sending messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second one is the entertainment package, which houses the multimedia files, the camera, the FM radio, the games, and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab includes tools such as the web browser, the Google package, organizer applications such as the Calendar, Calculator, Unit converter, etc. And, finally, the fourth item handles all the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the user interface comes in the black and white theme, well-known ever since the LG Prada phone. Beside that default one, the LG Renoir has another color theme as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An absolute must-have for every full touch-operated handset, and a feature we miss in the Apple iPhone (used to actually - thanks to some smart third-party developers), is some sort of feedback when the screen is pressed - besides the touch tone and the touch animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KC910 Renoir is haptic-enabled of course, every press is accompanied by a gentle vibration to let you know your press has been accepted. Settings for it include a choice of three types of vibration plus 7 levels of vibration strength.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 was the first touch handset by LG to make use of a task manager and the concept has been extended to the LG Renoir as well. You can run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on the Renoir has a new "launcher" tab that hosts a number of configurable shortcuts to various applications. The list is scrollable so you can fit quite a bunch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Pixon allows Java multi-tasking too, however it doesn't have a Task Manager of any kind. When you minimize a Java title on the Pixon, the only way to see it's still running is the small status icon next to its name. And the only way to end it, is to open it again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's get back to the Renoir. Another thing borrowed from KF700 is the Status screen - touching on any of the icons on the top status row (next to the clock) opens up a screen that displays signal, battery and memory stats and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The Samsung Pixon lacks a screen with similar functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is the usual good quality stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG Renoir is up to 1000 contacts (2000 on the Pixon), each with its own set of details. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a personal picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of available fields for each contact on your list - you start off with twelve fields, but once you enter a number, an additional number field becomes available. The same goes for email, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add a note to a contact and when you enter the birthday field, you can also have the phone save the date as a reminder to the calendar (unlike the Pixon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the contacts list is fluid and friendly. In fact, LG have done a great job with scrolling throughout the user interface so it's almost as enjoyable as on the iPhone. By the way, scrolling is equally nice on the Samsung Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't want to go through all the contacts for reaching those which start with "Z" for example, you can either use the search box at the top or you can drag the side scrollbar, which allows you to jump letters alphabetically (just as on the Pixon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for displaying the SIM and phone contacts separately, as well as together in a single list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir handles phone calls trouble-free, as you have every right to expect. The phone dialer works with an on-screen numeric keypad - the QWERTY one is quite naturally not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Smart Dialing, which the competing Samsung Pixon doesn't have, and Speed dial is supported. When you hit a key, which has been assigned, you get hinted of the contact in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any LG handset - the green receiver key takes you to the list of all calls. You can access them from the main menu too, but unlike the previous LG handsets, you won't find call time counters and the web data counter here. Those are moved to the Call settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir scored a Good mark in our loudspeaker performance test. While it is somewhat louder when using its music player, you may miss a call or two in noisy streets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Renoir stacks against some other handsets we've tested. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is intuitive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. Much like the Viewty, SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For typing you can use either the multi-tap alphanumeric keyboard, or you can rotate the Renoir and go for the landscape QWERTY one. There is touch feedback either way, and typing seems accurate even if the QWERTY keyboard is a little crammed up leaving buttons quite small. The Samsung Pixon QWERTY keyboard is a bit more spacey.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also handwriting recognition (three types of it actually) if you feel like using the stylus dongle supplied with the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG Renoir deals with them hasslefree. Setting up an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever setup scheme. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported. You can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum attachment size for outgoing mail is now 2MB instead of the 300KB in previous models, but the maximum size of incoming mail attachments is still 300KB. The sending limit of 2MB would allow most 8 megapixel images from the camera to be sent via email but the 300KB limit on incoming emails is quite impractical. The Samsung Pixon for example, will accept up to 5MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but still you can save those to the phone memory when you receive them. MS Office and PDF files can be opened and previewed directly inside the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for setting multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Superb multimedia performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir comes with 100MB of internal memory much like the Viewty and of course it's expandable via the microSD memory card slot. Hot-swapping a memory card is easy. We can also confirm that 8GB microSD cards worked fine on our unit. Some users claim that 16GB cards are handled trouble-free too, but we haven't tested that out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast but when you have a memory card inserted, each time you open the file browser it needs to refresh the image thumbnails. If you have a lot of images it can really get annoying, as the whole thing will take up to a good 5 seconds. Other than that there are no noticeable lags in file browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another drawback is that no matter what file sorting you opt for (date, type, name), the files on the memory card always get listed first. While that doesn't sound like a big deal, it should have been up to the user to decide, not software engineers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir file manager appears as the My stuff item in the menu. It includes separate factory-preset folders for different file content. The Renoir had no problem reading custom folders off the memory card, unlike some midrange LG phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG have vastly improved their image gallery with the LG Renoir and now it offers a great touch experience. Flicking through images feels so natural, this may as well be the first time we see a manufacturer get it fluid enough to compete with the Apple iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check your photos straight from the file manager or you can start the dedicated gallery where larger thumbnails are available. Still, the viewer for single images is one and the same for both methods.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse images in portrait or landscape mode just by changing the orientation of the handset itself. Unfortunately, zooming on an image is a bit slow and works in quite small steps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir also has an image editor, which offers a wide range of options. First off, you get a creative part that allows finger drawing on images, text typing, clipart watermarking, face morphing, selective colorization, and selective color boosting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then you have options for basic image treatment tools such as rotate, resize and mirror, as well as more advanced photo editing options such as levels, brightness, contrast, color, hue and saturation, sharpness, blur. Red-eye removal is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can add color effects such as black &amp; white, sepia, negative, glow, etc. An extra feature to the image editor is Face beautify, which softens skin and enhances skin tones. However, it doesn't really function as well as claimed, and we had several instances of enhancements being applied to only parts of the subject's face resulting in rather ugly transitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another enhancement that's not available in the feature-rich editor but can be applied in the file browser (strange, isn't it), is the Smart Light enhancement, pioneered on the LG Viewty, which ups the exposure of photos taken in dim light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, despite the rich features of the editor, we think it scores low on usability. The different options are inconsistently spread through various menus. Nevertheless, we highly doubt that most users will edit photos on their mobiles anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Renoir has the same Music player as LG Viewty. You can filter tracks as with any other up to date music player - by artist, album, genre, and recently played. User-created playlists are also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player can run in the background. If you want you can control the music straight on the home screen with the dedicated widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still no equalizer settings, but there is Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement, which does seem to make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to visualizations, the music player offers a choice of either Album art or random animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we couldn't run our usual audio quality test on the Renoir, since some technical glitch rendered our unit impossible to analyze. Perhaps, we'll be able to update as soon as we get hold of another unit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Renoir comes with FM radio and you can enjoy it on either earphones or through the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the music player, when the FM radio is running in the background you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir video player is among the most attractive features of the handset due to the still not so common DivX and XviD support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It successfully played every DivX and XviD movie we threw at it. In comparison, the Samsung Pixon, which also has DivX and XviD support, didn't manage to play all of the test videos due to unsupported resolution or bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the widescreen display, wide aspect videos are a treat in fullscreen landscape mode. The semi-transparent control overlays disappear in a few seconds so they don't get in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an additional feature you can take screenshots from the video you're watching, and you can also upload any video directly to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the much promoted Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement is not available to videos - you can make use of that in the music player only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can also be streamed to an external display thanks to the TV out port but, as usual, the TV out cable is sold separately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Online video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Renoir comes with YouTube integration alright. You can upload videos to YouTube directly from the handset. Bear in mind that the option is available only in the video player, and not in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG Renoir web browser doesn't have Flash support, so watching YouTube videos from the desktop version of the web site is a no-go. The same holds true for the Samsung Pixon too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only way to watch your favorite videos is via the mobile version of YouTube.com where videos get streamed in 3GP format over the RTSP protocol. If that's more mumbo-jumbo than you can handle, here's what it means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile version of YouTube found at m.youtube.com gets you access to the same videos as the desktop version, however they are of inferior in quality so that they can be played over the wireless carrier network - EDGE or UMTS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strange as it may seem, the LG Renoir would allow you to watch streaming media (of any type) only over that EDGE or UMTS connection, so in essence - you cannot watch the streaming mobile YouTube videos over Wi-Fi. A real bummer, we know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since we've noticed a lot of users not realizing this fact, here's a tip for you - to watch streaming videos (such as YouTube) you first need to setup the streaming settings of the phone to use the same internet profile as your mobile web browser. The place you do that is in Settings tab&gt;Connectivity&gt; Streaming settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have no Internet profile setup at all, you need to define an access point (enter the carrier settings) and then you'd have to create an Internet profile that uses this access point. After you're done, just go and setup the Streaming options to use that same Internet profile. You can use the same one for the web browser, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that should be enough to get you started.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-of-the-line imaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir packs a whopping 8 megapixel autofocus camera with maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. Video recording is also on par with options varying from VGA@30fps videos through slow-mo QVGA@120fps to time-lapse QVGA clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already reviewed the image department of the LG Renoir in great detail in our 8 megapixel shootout where we compared it to some of the other 8 megapixel sharp-shooters out there. You can jump to it later on to see how the Renoir fares in fierce competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is hidden under a manually operated cover that you can also use to toggle the camera on and off. Its slider is located on the ring around the lens. The problem with this slider is that it offers little grip and sometimes takes a try or two to slide it open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is comfortable to work with and a short press on it starts the still camera, while a longer one activates the camcorder (use the key lock to prevent accidental presses).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another hardware button next to the shutter key toggles the digital image stabilization. The practicality of this shortcut is dubious as we for one almost never use digital image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is xenon flash on board to assist shooting stills, but no LED flash to use for video recording. We are quite disappointed with the xenon flash performance - it's not even nearly as powerful as the one on Sony Ericsson C905, plus it always gets the white balance and exposure settings wrong. As a result flash pictures with the Renoir always turn out underexposed with a heavy bluish tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir camera has a pleasant interface where most options are displayed as semi-transparent screen overlays. Those are easy to touch and pick, so handling the camera menu is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only issue with that kind of interface is that the settings in the camera viewfinder are displayed as graphical icons only and not every user will guess what they do unless they give them a test run. That hurts usability to an extent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having a huge amount of settings on screen is not that user-friendly either. So every cameraphone has an extended settings menu that takes care of the least used options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's ok with us, however picking the right ones to put in the viewfinder is of crucial importance to user-friendliness. Unfortunately, the LG Renoir is not the best example. Let us explain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason, LG have forced the viewfinder to fullscreen mode. But as the camera sensor has a different aspect ratio than the widescreen viewfinder, some of the image gets cropped. It still gets captured, but you don't really see it in the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, since the viewfinder is fullscreen, the overlay camera controls are only a few and they fade off the screen after a really short period of time so that they don't get in your way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in essence - the controls of the LG Renoir are (1) not always at hand (due to the fullscreen viewfinder) and (2) even when you tap on the screen to display them you get only a few, with still quite a lot of important setting buried in the Extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, about the available settings. First off, there's the standard set of options such as white balance, preset scene modes, self-timer, color effects, ISO and exposure compensation. A dedicated macro mode is available and close-ups usually turn out fine. Unfortunately, neither the scenes menu nor the macro switch is available as shortcuts in the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir has a nice Continuous shooting mode that snaps 7 full-res images and then allows you to review them and pick the keeper(s).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama mode also deserves attention. The Renoir can take up to three full-res shots that are stitched together automatically. The actual snapping is not automatic but your panning is assisted by a semi-transparent overlay on screen to show you where the last frame ended, so you can take it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in GPS you can also get fairly accurate GPS data embedded in your photos. Later on, when you upload them to a geotag-enabled photo sharing service (Flickr or Picasa to name a few) you can show your friends and family where you took them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection and tracking is another hip feature making its way into high-end cameraphones. Unlike digital cameras however, the Renoir can only detect/track one face at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smile detection is a nice add-on to the face detection gadgetry. When smile detection is enabled, it sets the camera in auto shutter mode, so instead of shooting right up when you press the shutter all the way down it waits for a smile on the currently detected face and snaps only when the time is right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the last geeky feature is blink detection, which is supposed to deal with eye blinks in portraits and group shots. Unfortunately, the Renoir warns you of any blinks only after the shot has been taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the LG Renoir has several other aces up its sleeves. Beside manual focus, it also offers the so-called backlight compensation mode. It helps shoot backlit portraits by exposing for the face while keeping as much detail in the background as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tool in the LG ammo is Beauty shot, which we guess many people would welcome. It smoothes skin and enhances skin tone for a better portrait.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir also offers enhanced color effects that include cooling or warming the scene and adding a nice looking vignette as part of their Art shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now those are things that you can easily replicate with most desktop image editors but if you are among the many people that don't like to waste time with post processing on a computer, now you have a chance to get those shots just as you like them straight in the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, LG are offering the nifty little Touch shot feature. It's simple - choose an object you would like to focus on and simply point it on the screen. When the handset focuses, lift your finger and voila - you've got your photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, that type of focusing is way impractical in real-life shooting. The whole thing brings all kinds of challenges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you touch the object on the screen, you can't really see what's under your finger. So you can't know if your subject looks good right when you shoot; you can't see when the autofocus indicator has turned green to show you it has nailed it, and you will be struggling to frame your shot with your finger getting in the way. Still, the feature is there if you want to give it a spin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the LG Renoir is not the only handset to offer Touch Focus - Sony Ericsson G900 pioneered it, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 features it as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Shooting stills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, when it comes to image quality, the LG Renoir is a real treat. It resolves a high level of detail and has excellent edge-to-edge sharpness probably due to some high-quality lens used. There are also no signs of nasty purple fringing on high-contrast edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image noise is kept well under control and doesn't cause any troubles. At low ISO levels you would probably find the results as nice as those of a regular point-and-shoot camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is also pleasingly precise in almost all situations. Colors turn out natural except for the reds, which tend to be a bit pinky, but all other cameraphones have troubles with those, so it's not a big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only fault we find with the Renoir in-camera processing is the oversharpening it applies. Subject edges get too pronounced and there is an easily visible "staircase effect" on diagonal lines. However if you don't like to edit your images on a computer, you may as well like it this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some sample photos from the LG Renoir camera:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capturing video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir manages VGA@30fps video recording with no issues. It even encodes videos with the superior DivX compression and records AVI files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an option for widescreen videos, but they are captured in either 640x384 pixels or 400x240 pixels resolution. So its widescreen VGA mode is actually less than the regular VGA, while the widescreen QVGA is actually higher than regular QVGA. The nice thing about those clips is that they make full use of the wide display and nicely play fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slow motion video recording is abother really neat trick, pioneered in mobile phones by LG with their Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Later on LG expanded the video capabilities of their mobile even more and with the LG Secret we had quite some fun with time-lapse action-packed videos in QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both of these video modes are available on the LG Renoir as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several samples recorded by the LG Renoir in various formats:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1. Normal VGA video at 30 fps 2. Time-lapse QVGA video 3. High-speed QVGA video taken at 120 fps</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is in the fast lane<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir features quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support plus dual-band HSDPA 7.2Mbps - or at least that's what the manufacturer claims. There seems to be a lot of commotion about the supposed quad-band support of the Renoir. Many users (especially in the US) order the device online only to find that the shipped product is tri-band (stated right on the very box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far there's no official statement on the matter by LG, so we guess this discrepancy has something to do with some regional versions of the Renoir not being quad-band.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other connectivity options of the Renoir include Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP support for channeling music to a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB Mass Storage mode is also on board. Much like the Viewty, when you connect the Renoir to a computer you only have the memory card appearing as a removable drive, and the internal memory is not accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to access it, you'll need to install the proprietary LG PC Suite that's also used for syncing your handset PIM details with the computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The very same USB port is also used for pairing the handset with a TV set if you have the optional TV cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can also plug in the headphones stereo adapter supplied in the retail package. The adapter ends on a 3.5mm audio jack so your favorite headphones are compatible with the Renoir.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Renoir has a generally nice web browser, which seems more responsive than the one on the Samsung Pixon. Scrolling is fast enough and you can drag pages around with your finger much like you would on an iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse web pages with or without controls visible. A tap on the screen brings back the controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in and out is quite intuitive too - a longer hold on a section of a web page will zoom in so it fits on the screen from side to side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the screen landscape is automatic thanks top the built-in accelerometer and it makes browsing even more enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all that is not enough, the browser can work with up to two separate tabs and it can save web pages to be viewed offline. You can also search web pages for specific text strings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the web browser history is quite conveniently displayed as a line of webpage screenshots - you can flick through them and just pick the one you want to open again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. But, as we already pointed out in the multimedia section of this review, you can go for the mobile version of YouTube found at m.youtube.com once you setup your streaming settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got to point out that the free Opera Mini web browser that we installed additionally on the Renoir is noticeably faster at loading web pages and is more responsive to your touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Heavy duty organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward, it offers a monthly and a weekly view, and you can browse dates with your finger. When you touch on a date, a pop-up appears so you can see what's under the tip of your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as the Viewty, you can choose which day should be the first day of the week by default. You can also choose the default view - weekly or monthly. Adding an event is made really simple. You can have up to 500 calendar events (300 on the Pixon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a separate To-Do application and it also stores up to 500 tasks. There is a Memo feature that allows storing some notes (up to 50). Another organizing app is the Date Finder - it's simple stuff like "Let's see what date will it be five days from now!"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you can backup your calendar events and to-do's on the memory card, and restore them later on if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has 5 alarm slots available. The LG Renoir also offers a Calculator, Unit converter, World clock and a Voice recorder. Once you record a voice note, you can send it via MMS, email or Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>There's some extra stuff, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir also offers office document viewing courtesy of the Picsel viewer. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports DOC, XLS, PPT and PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on the LG Viewty, scrolling and zooming in documents is relatively fast and fluid, except on closer zoom levels. Searching is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even view your documents in landscape mode. The viewer switches to it automatically when you tilt the handset. Unfortunately, the zoom control and the mini-map are not available in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Google package is another boost to the web experience for the LG Renoir user. Much like the LG Viewty, it offers shortcuts to Google Search, Gmail, Blogger and the mobile version of YouTube. From there you can also open the Google Maps app that comes pre-installed on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also easily download the Java-based Gmail application, which gives you a better, more optimized experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the most popular electronic map software that you can use on your LG Renoir to make use of its embedded GPS receiver. Unfortunately, the competing Yahoo! Go application is not compatible with LG Renoir yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, you can go for the free Mobile Gmaps application that will provide the Yahoo Maps for you, plus it allows you to even preload them on a memory card so that you don't get charged for downloading them over the cellular network. And best of all, it recognizes the internal GPS of the Renoir hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, despite the Renoir GPS capabilities, there is no popular Java software that will provide you with voice-guided GPS navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have equipped the Renoir with another GPS-based application - the Jogging buddy. As the name suggests it's a sports application, which should come handy for joggers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses the GPS receiver to detect your speed and reports other stuff such as the distance covered and the calories burnt. The application is rather basic and it's nowhere near competing products such as Nokia Sports Tracker for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now don't get us wrong. While the Jogging buddy seems a bit of an underdog when it comes to sports, it may still serve some purpose. Getting you the distance travelled (or jogged if you prefer) sounds like a useful thing for sure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Not really into handheld gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir comes with two simple accelerometer based games (or sort of) plus three Java titles in trial versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two accelerometer-based thingies rest in the M-Toy corner, which up so far has served us with some simple, yet enjoyable games in previous models. This time we are not exactly looking at games but more of helper applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one (Flying dices) allows you to roll a pair of dices by shaking the handset. The second one is a rotating Wheel of fortune (called Wheel Mania). The sectors on the wheel represent different card types (cards, as in playing cards), so essentially both applications are not really games on their own, but more of applications that allows you to play other gambling games with friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Java game titles include Asphalt 3, Bubble Bash and Diamond Twister. As we said, those are just taster versions, so you better find yourself another pastime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you are free to install other games of your choice without worrying about the unconventional resolution - titles for QVGA screens run just as fine on the Renoir, taking only the upper two thirds of the screen. The unused space is occupied by virtual controls that make up for the lack of a D-pad and context keys in applications that are not touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are programs such as Opera Mini that don't need the virtual controls as they support touch operation, while there are others such as the unofficial Google Talk for Mobile that will accept commands only from the virtual controls at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is available for Java apps, however you can only switch to it manually from the Options menu once you start inputting a text field. The competing Samsung Pixon has a better implementation of the feature as the QWERTY keyboard is automatic (just tilt the screen) and there's also handwriting recognition as an option for text input in Java apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KC910 Renoir is without a doubt an impressive package. It's got a nice user interface with rich feature set such as the capable task manager and well developed multi-tasking, excellent touch optimized gallery, DivX/XviD video support plus direct YouTube uploads, as well as auto screen rotation and a landscape QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely, the Renoir rich features such as Wi-Fi and GPS are a bit limited by the feature phone interface, but if you are after a more expandable platform such as Symbian S60, the Samsung INNOV8 is your only cameraphone option right now and although similarly priced, it would mean you'd have to ditch the touchscreen functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pleased with the LG Renoir camera features and performance too with the small exception of the image oversharpening it applies and the feeble xenon flash that's not only underpowered but also throws the camera automatic exposure and white balance over board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG handset has its other quirks too - lack of video streaming over Wi-Fi (you can enjoy YouTube only over the cellular network), silly 300KB limitation of incoming emails, no QWERTY keyboard in the Java apps and no free games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing between the LG Renoir and its direct competitor - Samsung Pixon - is a tough call since both are similarly priced. While the Pixon lacks Wi-Fi, it adds to the equation 0.2 inches of screen estate, more advanced widgets system, a snappier interface, WVGA video recording and a true quad-band support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the end, it's the consumer that makes the final decision - choosing between such close competitors is always a matter of personal evaluation and there's no one-size-fits-all answer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Happy holidays to you all!</paragraph>
