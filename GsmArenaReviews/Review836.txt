			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo has been consistently living up to its name as an innovator in the mobile space and actually over-delivering in terms of user experience and features. To be fair, it's only going to get harder for them - this was easily a brand to approach with low expectations, but not anymore. The Oppo Find 5 was a flagship to be proud of, and the N1 raised the bar even higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nearly a year and a half after the Find 5, Oppo is about to unleash its next premium device - actually a pair this time. The company is doing well to use the latest technology available - even better to give users a choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the current crop of flagships is still utilizing 1080p displays, the QHD screens are on the verge of becoming the next big hardware breakthrough (and key selling point). And Oppo is letting you decide which screen resolution will best suit your needs and budget. The Full HD display on the already available Find 7a, which we're about to review, or the Quad HD screen on the upcoming Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today we'll be making the rounds with the recently released Find 7a - which is impressive enough on paper, even though clearly the lesser package. It still packs quite the processing punch, a huge IPS display, feature-rich and quite capable camera, a wealth of connectivity options and a custom-made Android UI. Here goes the full cheat sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a matches the true flagship almost to a t - the key difference being screen resolution. More than reasonably priced for the level of equipment, the Find 7a has every right to hope for a warm reception - and that's in the face or serious competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, to some the Oppo Find 7a may look like the adopted child next to the QHD-screen-touting sibling, plus Oppo didn't give their best effort naming it. But QHD or not, it seems quite capable of keeping up - and even outsmarting - most of the competing flagships. Ready for a ride?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Oppo Find 7a<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a comes in a flat retail box, quite similar to the Oppo N1's luxury packaging. This level of attention to detail leaves no doubt that you are unboxing a premium smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you get in the box is a rather large piece of a charger (it's a high-current, fast charger ), a separate microUSB cable and a single-piece headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charger is quite powerful, providing the Oppo Find 7a with 4.5A of electric current. This is way above the 1A or 2A of the popular chargers, so it's best that you don't use it for other microUSB compatible devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Oppo Find 7a 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a measures 152.6 x 75 x 9.2 mm, which is more compact than the 5.9" Oppo N1 and very close to the Galaxy Note 3 though the Find 7a is thicker. Oppo's latest flagship weighs about 170g - the same as the Note 3, but 43g less than the Oppo N1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is almost as big as the Note 3 phablet and bigger than Samsung's Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is a premium device and definitely looks the part - as the company's high-end smartphones have done so far. It looks a lot like the Find 5, but with slimmer screen bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo continues to insist on the assertive, angular styling the Find 5 introduced to the series, and we don't mind that at all. The most notable difference between the two generations is the absence of a "chin" - on the Find 5 the white finish of the rear extends to the bottom front, which was a very nice accent. The 7a has a more conservative all-black front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire front is covered with what looks like a proprietary factory installed screen protector though it seems it can be removed. Sony ships their phones whit a similar screen coating, though non-removable, for shatter proofing the screen in its Xperia line. The Oppo Find 7a has the latest Gorilla Glass 3 of course but we don't mind the extra touch of care - especially when it's up to the user to keep or get rid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the screen protector is quite prone to smudges and hard to clean so we chose to do away with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Find 7a is made of textured white plastic, which is even better than the matte finish we've seen on other Oppo handsets. The Find 7a is really a pleasure to handle, while having an almost rugged feel and great grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a has one foot in phablet territory with a big 5.5" screen. Still, we found it reasonably easy to operate, its controls (lock key, volume rocker) nicely placed and accessible with just one hand too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of controls, let's take a closer look at the Oppo Find 7a and see what's there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the familiar pieces of equipment around the earpiece: a 5MP front cam, along with proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the usual set of three capacitive keys - Menu, Home and Back. Those have a very faint and dim blue backlight and are barely visible even when the backlight is set to always on. You'll eventually get used to their placement, but until then your thumb may wander around the deck, while you are looking for the right key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, just below the bottom deck of controls is a notification light strip, which lights up gradually for a nice visual effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Oppo Find 7a features the volume rocker and a tiny pinhole near the bottom to release the battery cover. You'll need a thin pointed object to open the battery cover - a normal ball pen tip usually does the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is the only control on the left. We find its location a bit hard to get used to as most smartphones meant for the European and US market have it on the right-hand side but it's not a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone is a microUSB port and the mouthpiece. At the top is the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens is at the back, along with a dual-LED flash and a prominent loudspeaker grille. The Oppo Find 7a has the so-called Super Zoom feature to create a 50MP image out of four 13MP shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 2,800mAh user-replaceable Li-Ion battery. The micro-SIM compartment and microSD slot are also around, but you'll have to remove the battery to access them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Easily one of the key selling features of the device, the 5.5" screen of the Oppo Find 7a has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, resulting in around 401ppi. Hardly a surprise for an IPS unit, the side viewing angles are excellent - it's a high-quality screen, no doubt about that. The screen's digitizer is super-sensitive and the phone can be used with gloves (if you turn that on in the settings menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB with an equal amount of green, red and blue pixels in a line. Below you can see it magnified using our trusty microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast of the screen is pretty good, color reproduction is great too, all adding up to an excellent image quality screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the sunlight legibility is rather mediocre. Oppo has shipped the Find 7a with a factory equipped screen protector. It is quite the finger-print magnet though, very hard to clean and reduces the sunlight legibility as it?s quite reflective. We didn't try to remove it on our review unit, but we would have without a doubt done so if it was a personally purchased device. The Gorilla Glass 3 layer on top should be enough to keep the screen in top shape even without a screen protector film.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a's 2,800mAh battery can be fully charged in about an hour, thanks to the high current fast charger. If in a hurry, a few minutes on the charger will give the Find 7a enough juice to last a couple of hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional battery test and the results are in. The Oppo Find 7a pulled an overall rating of 60 hours. The 60-hour rating means the Oppo Find 7a will last two and a half days on a full charge with an hour each of calling, browsing and watching video daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a did pretty well when it comes to talking, web browsing and video playback, but its standby battery performance is rather mediocre. For a more detailed breakdown of the Oppo Find 7a battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Color OS atop Android Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7a runs on Oppo's proprietary Color OS v1.2, which is another name for a heavily skinned Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. The Oppo's launcher customizations run very deep, they keep all Google apps and services, and even bring quite a few of its own - themes support, new lockscreen, homescreen, app drawer and settings menu among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not into custom UIs, there is a preinstalled theme called Jelly Bean, which would replicate the stock Android Jelly Bean UI for you as close as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick Color OS rundown on video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, let's cover the Color OS lockscreen. It's almost identical to the stock Android one. There's an unlock ring, which you slide to get to the homescreen. You can have widgets on the lockscreen, which are located to the left of the main window, while on the right there's a camera shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen supports double tap to wake gesture and it also works on the Home key. By the way the lockscreen has a hidden flashlight shortcut - a press and hold of the Home button (the screen needs to be awake) turns on the dual-LED flash. It goes out when you let go of the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the LG G2, the Oppo Find 7a has a Guest mode. It only gives access to apps that you've pre-selected so you have no problem sharing your phone without worrying about your private data or your settings getting all messed up. In order to use Guest Mode you'll need to set up a pattern or password unlock for regular access and another one for the Guest Mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen of the Oppo Find 7a likes to keep things huge - its apps above the dock are organized in a grid of 4x4 and the widgets are hardly optimized for the large, high resolution screen. On the up side, you can add up to 9 homescreen panes, whereas most custom launchers top out at 7 (the stock Android one is fixed at 5).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen is reserved for the dock. You can have any shortcuts or folders you like here - you can even move the app drawer shortcut (but not remove it altogether as you won't be able to access it). The dock has four default shortcuts (Dialer, Messaging, App drawer and Camera) by default, but you can actually fit a fifth one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is pretty simple - it has horizontally scrollable pages of 20 shortcuts or folders. A small green dot marks newly installed apps that haven't been launched yet. You can re-arrange or add to homescreen shortcuts by tap and hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the notification area will show one row of quick toggles, a brightness slider and a shortcut for enabling auto brightness mode, the current notifications plus a shortcut to go into settings. If you do a drag gesture from the quick toggles row you get two more lines of toggles. There's also a Kill all apps button there. At the bottom of the notification area sits a clear button to remove all your notifications at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on a toggle will bring up its respective settings entry. By the way you can access the notification area even if you slide down from any empty part of the homescreen (not just the top), which helps single-handed use a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is pretty close to stock Android. All your apps are shown in a vertically-scrollable grid of thumbnails, which you swipe either side to close or tap to open. Oppo has added a Kill All toggle at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By holding a finger on an empty spot on the homescreen or performing a swipe up from the dock you open up the contextual menu. It lists widgets, wallpapers, effects and themes. You drag widgets upwards to place them on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exclusive space is Oppo's custom homescreen page. Currently, there are only two available - Photo and Music. Photo space takes up a whole homescreen and features a live viewfinder so you can take shots straight from your homescreen plus a shortcut to the full camera app. Bellow you get a timeline with all your recent photos and you can share them very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second Exclusive space homescreen pane is Music. It features a cool, if slightly intuitive design with a vinyl for changing the currently playing song and stopping/resuming playback. You can change songs, go directly to the music player or the Phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo's Color OS supports themes, but besides the default Color OS, you only get one extra. It changes the appearance of the homescreen, app icons and app drawer to match what you would get on stock Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the wallpaper with live or static ones and change the scrolling effect of the homescreens. There's one more option - Live Weather - it can flicker snow, rain, dandelions, etc. over the screen. The effect is very impressive - for instance, snow would pile up on the bottom of your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Gesture panel. You access it just like you would open your notification area, but you need to start your swipe in the left quarter of the bar at the top, just as if you were pulling down the notification area. You can perform various gestures in the Gesture panel to open different apps. For instance drawing a circle would open the camera app but you can assign any apps to any gestures you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the homescreen, the Settings menu is another part of the UI that has seen a lot of changes. It is divided in three tabs - General, Sound and Display. The tabbed design is intuitive and works pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Gesture &amp; motion menu deserves our attention. It holds all the various gesture and motion tricks to make your life with the Find 7a easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one you can swipe with three fingers across the screen to capture a screenshot or pinch with several fingers to launch the camera and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motion options are very useful, too - flipping the device will mute the ringer, raising the ringing Oppo Find 7a to your ear will automatically answer the call and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now is here too - it integrates with your Google account info and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Color OS strives to be more feature rich than stock Android and has been customized quite deeply. It is still Android though, so users, who are familiar with the OS won't have trouble knowing their way around Color OS. In fact most of Oppo's additions are quite welcome and improve the user experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset model MSM8974AB, while the QHD-boasting Find 7 is powered by the Snapdragon 801 MSM8974AC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MSM8974 chipset is the base Snapdragon 800 chipset, while MSM8974AB has a higher clocked GPU (up to 578MHz from the base 450MHz) and hence has deserved the Snapdragon 801 badge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MSM8974AC goes a step further and has a higher clock for the Krait 400 CPU cores as well ? they reach up to 2.5GHz from the stock 2.3GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Find 7a has Snapdragon 801 chipset inside with four Krait 400 cores clocked at 2.3GHz, an Adreno 330 GPU @578MHz and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first test - BenchmarkPi - tests the single CPU core performance and the Krait 400 scored on par with other Snapdragon 800-powered devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7a aced the multi-core Linpack test with a score, quite similar to that of the LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another accurate CPU benchmark test is GeekBench 3, where the Oppo Find 7a managed to beat every other smartphone we've tested so far, including those running on Android 4.4 KitKat.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In compound benchmarks - Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 ? the Oppo Find 7a produced similar scores to the other S800-powered smartphones such as the Xperia Z1, Galaxy Note 3, LG G2 and G Flex. HTC One M8 running on the same chipset managed to beat the Oppo Find 7a though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II tests just about every facet of your phone's performance. It's exactly here that manufacturers used to heavily cheat, so we ran an anti-cheat version that should've kept any trickery out of the equation. The Find 7a produced the same results as the other Snapdragon 800 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to offscreen benchmarks, the higher clock speed of the new Adreno 330 easily pushes it on top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 3.0 Manhattan (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lower resolution phones (720p or so) like the Xperia Z1 Compact and iPhone 5s climb on top, but as far as 1080p devices go, the Oppo Find 7a is only matched by the HTC One (M8) and the Galaxy S5 on the GFXBench suite. Epic Citadel placed it around the top too, beaten only by the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 3.0 Manhattan (1080p on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is an integral part to any smartphone experience, and the Find 7a posts respectable, if not remarkable, results in both of our browser benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Oppo Find 7a clearly proved as a blazing fast performer across all benchmarks. But the synthetic tests aside, the smartphone also delivers amazing lag-free and buttery-smooth UI experience even without the KitKat optimizations. And isn't that just awesome?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Contact management and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses a tabbed interface - it offers groups, then there's the contact list and favorites. The UI is pretty standard Android affair, save for the custom paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact's photo brings out Quick contacts - shortcuts for calling, texting, emailing a contact and a bit more (e.g. a Chrome shortcut to visit their web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact syncing tools are very powerful - contacts can be moved or copied between phone storage and a Google account, they can be synced with an Exchange server or Facebook, and you can send / import contacts over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an Anti-harassment mode located in the contacts app, which is pretty powerful. You can put numbers in a blacklist, block messages and intercept spam calls. The strange thing is, you can't block people from within the messaging or phone app - only in the contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports Smart dialing just fine (looking up both names and phone numbers). The Oppo Find 7a offers a Holiday mode, in which only notifications and calls from a whitelist of users will get through, while the rest will get muted or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the call settings you can tweak a number of things. One is Notify on connect - the phone can vibrate or ring (or both) when a call connects. You can also build a list of texts to send when you decline a call. Flip to mute calls is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a scored a Very Good mark on our loudspeaker test. This means you won't miss any calls or notifications with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we did the test with various WAVE sound presets - the results varied between Good and Very Good. The main difference came from the Pink Noise test, which is a clear testament to the fact that the Wave sound presets are quite capable of tuining how music sounds through the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a loudspeaker is quite loud no matter what preset you are using, but you can squeeze even more, courtesy of the WAVE effects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all bubble-styled conversations organized into threads, with a big New Message button at the bottom and a settings button next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts is also included and supports SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen and supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7a offers great Swype-enabled keyboard with big keys and they become even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the wide screen is remarkably comfortable for two-thumb typing. There is an option to change the individual key height in both portrait and landscape, which isn't found that often. Themes are available too. You can select to have a split or mini keyboard layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing the device in landscape expands the keyboard immensely but leaves too little space for the text box above and we found ourselves never really using landscape as the portrait keyboard was spacious enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A custom gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the Oppo Find 7a is a custom job, but surprisingly one with less features than the vanilla app. The default view is a grid of folders, with a name and number of images for each folder labeled underneath. You can't filter images by location, time, people or tags like you would in the stock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images inside folders are arranged on a rectangular grid and you have two options - image selection mode and start a slideshow. You can select multiple images (folders too) and then Share and Delete options become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it, delete it or get a menu with more functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image editor offers light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights, you can apply effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and WAVE effects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo's latest music player has quite a simplistic interface and is very easy to use and navigate. It supports the Oppo's latest audio customizations called WAVE as well as Dirac HD Audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave audio enhancements apply on all music-related apps and games no matter if you are using headphones or the loudspeaker. There are a few WAVE presets you can use, but you can also customize one preset by yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize some basic options such as maximum bass, treble, volume and dialog, but you can also completely configure the audio frequency curve. So if you are using some high-quality headphones, you can fully customize your audio experience. We wish Oppo had provided an automatic configuration similar to Samsung's Adapt Sound though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player UI is pretty straightforward - your music library is organized into a local list of all music, favorites, artists, albums and folders. There's also an option to add a playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is split into two - the current playlist and the album art/music controls screen. You can swipe between the two. By default the player will look for lyrics and display them under the album art, which imitates a vinyl record. You can add album art if it's not built inside the tracks (but the player won't look for it automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a playback mode button (normal, shuffle, repeat track) and a toggle for audio enhancement. That cycles through Off, Dolby and Dirac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the music player successfully played a 16-bit FLAC file so there is hardly anything it won't play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is on, the notification area lets you control the playback via an expandable notification but there are no music controls on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music is preloaded on the Oppo Find 7a if you prefer that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a comes with a pretty simple-looking video player, which supports DivX, Xvid, Avi, MVK, MP4, etc. We had no issues playing files all the way up to 1080p resolution and the only real setback were files with AC3 sound, which obviously is not supported and the videos run without sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface for video selection is pretty basic too - a list of all available files. The player supports subtitles too, but there's only an on/off toggle here, you can't manually pick the subtitle file (so it would have to have the same name as the video file to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While watching a video you get a timeline scrubber, play/pause along with forward/back controls, a lock option (which locks the display against accidental touches) and a pop up toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that seems lifted right off the Samsung Galaxy flagships is the pop-up player. It's a small floating window that lets you have other apps working underneath. You can move it around to get it out of the way, but there's no resize option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a supports Wi-Fi display but you'd need a display with the standard's support to output video on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output but not without some flaws<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a audio output is certainly among the cleanest we have seen when the smartphone is connected to an active external amplifier. Posting excellent scores top to bottom in the first part of our test, the Find 7a was also nicely loud, producing one of the best performances out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones tells a different story, however. The stereo crosstalk increases way beyond the point where it can be considered as good, or even acceptable. The other readings remain great, but the high cross-channel leakage has the potential of damaging the whole audio experience for more exacting users and put the Oppo Find 7a below the current crop of flagships as far as audio output is concerned.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP camera can shoot 50MP stills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a looks to be one of the phone's key selling points. It's obvious that a lot of hard labor has went into making a great cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is based around a Sony Exmor IMX214 BSI 1/3.06" CMOS sensor of 13MP resolution. The lens has a bright, F/2.0 aperture. The camera is capable of producing 50MP interpolated shots, RAW images, HDRs and Panoramas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7a is quite in tune with the world's fixation on the selfie genre and comes equipped with a 5MP front snapper, which takes some nice photos as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the regular flash mode, the LED flash on the back of the phone can work in a fill light mode, producing a naturally looking image without any color shift and without strong shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has two control sidebars in the viewfinder, the right one holding the still and video buttons and gallery shortcut, while the left one is for settings, flash and front 5MP camera switch. The standard way of accessing recently snapped photos - a left swipe - is available here too and you can swipe up to delete photos straight from the image viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the screen there's a little three dot toggle, which will guide you through the different shooting modes - Beauty, Panorama, HDR, Ultra HD Picture, RAW, GIF, Audio Photo, Slow Shutter and Normal. Our unit's RAW mode produced JPG pictures identical to those from the Normal shooting mode - obviously this isn't working at this pre-release stage so we can't comment on those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Slow Shutter mode allows for longer than usual exposures - from 1 up to 32 seconds actually (the Lumia 1020 can only shoot reach a shutter speed of up to 4 seconds).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beauty mode will snap a photo of a person, preferably in portrait mode. The mode removes imperfections like skin lines, facial hair, etc. Then the app gives you various makeup options. It detects eyes and mouth but you can fine tune them if the app gets them wrong. It's more of a fun app than a practical enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultra HD Picture is a very interesting feature advertised as Super Zoom. It snaps ten (probably 13MP) photos in a flash and then post-process them to create a single 50MP sample, giving you plenty of room for zoom in and cropping a part of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a camera captured impressively good photos. The image processing is nicely mature, bringing noise levels down without sacrificing much high-frequency detail. There is plenty of resolved detail, the colors look accurate with spot-on white balance. Contrast is good too, and so is edge-to-edge sharpness. We really like Oppo's work on the Find 7a camera processing algorithm. Here come a few 13MP samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also took a few snaps in bad weather just to show you the camera keep its cool all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, we come to the Panorama shooting mode. You can capture up to 180 degrees and the resulting image is up to 15MP. Note that if you hold the phone vertically you'll be getting those 15MP pano shots (6100x2500px), while the horizontal shooting will output images only up to 10MP (5500x1900px).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panoramic images are quite good, too, the stitching is fine as are the colors and contrast. The resolved detail isn't on par with the regular still images, but it is more than enough to please most of the users. Here is a sample Panorama photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a nice HDR mode on the Oppo Find 7a. It snaps several shots of the same scene with different exposure settings and then combines them into a single image. It does an excellent job of adding more detail in the highlights without going overboard with the effect and keeping the real-life look of the photos. Enjoy the samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we just couldn't miss the opportunity to snap a long exposure shot. As we mentioned already the Oppo Find 7a is capable of slower shutter speeds, ranging from 1s up to 32s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped a few Super Zoom 50MP samples side-by-side with the Lumia 1020 in 38MP mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the 50MP samples all have good colors, contrast and little noise, the resolved detail is quite uninspiring. The side-by-side comparison with the Lumia 1020 38MP shots shows Nokia's top cameraphone does a better job, but that was expected since it does boasts a 41MP camera sensor instead of relying on software post-processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We even tried downscaling those to 38MP and see if they are on par with the Lumia's. They are not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We downscaled the 50MP samples to 13MP and compared them to Oppo's regular 13MP images taken in Normal camera mode. The downscaled images weren't on par with the 13MP shots and we don't think you can use this Ultra HD Picture with the hope of taking better pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo claims the 50MP Ultra HD Picture should be used for high-quality prints. It's worth noting the samples are indeed better than anything we could have achieved by upscaling the regular 13MP to 50MP, so they certainly have their use, especially if you would like to crop and keep only a portion of the image. But we'd still use the excellent 13MP Normal mode most of the times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the full resolution samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here some 5MP shots snapped with the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a enters our Photo quality comparison tool to compete against the latest flagships. It definitely does a great job on all three charts - the resolved detail is top notch, the colors are quite accurate and the contrast is good too. There are no visible defects of whatsoever, pink spots or oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Oppo Find 7a in our photo compare test</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also snapped the three charts in 50MP Ultra HD Picture mode. The results are nothing to write home about, but you can compare them to Lumia 1020 and Xperia Z1 test samples, if you are curious.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2160p and 1080p video recording at 30fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is capable of 2160p and 1080p video capture at 30 frames per second plus 720p slow-mo videos at 120fps. Oppo's specs sheet claims the smartphone is capable of 1080p@60fps recording too, but this moe was absent on our pre-release unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To compensate, both 4K and 1080p video samples turned out great - there is lots of resolved detail and the quality is similar to the stills - accurate colors and very good contrast. Both modes produced samples with a steady 30fps frame rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've uploaded a 4K and a 1080p video samples over at YouTube. Check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download untouched 4K@30fps and 1080p@30fps video samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR video shares the same credentials as the normal one but adjusts the exposure a little differently, resulting in less contrast in the scene. The level of captured detail seems about the same, but not quite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an HDR 1080p video sample on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched HDR 1080p video sample for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is among the few 2160p-enabled cameraphones in our database, but they are becoming more common with recent releases. The resolution chart (the third one) shows lots of detail but the Galaxy S5 and the G Pro 2 did a little better. In low light the Oppo Find 7a does great, even better than Samsung's and LG's flagships.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Complete connectivity package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a comes jam-packed with connectivity features. It has quad-band GSM, penta-band HSPA and quad-band LTE Cat.4 support. There's dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, microUSB 2.0 with USB on the go support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One useful app here is the System update app, which can be used to update the phone's software over the air or from a local file (a ZIP saved in the internal memory). The latter is one of the easiest way software upgrade utilities we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Data monitor app preloaded on the Oppo Find 7a, which scans how much data you've used through Wi-Fi and the carrier network you're using. The app can set limits for usage and also break down the used data by apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data Saving app allows you to restrict the data usage in background mode. You can choose which apps are allowed to use background data and which are restricted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a comes with Google Chrome as its preinstalled browser. The interface is the same as on any other Android smartphone - clean and minimalist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. Incognito tabs are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous on customizable settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a comes with Kingsoft Office preinstalled. It's a pretty powerful office editor that can handle Word docs, PDFs, Spreadsheets and Presentations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can link to cloud storage, email files, create a shared view with other users and more. There's editing enabled too so you can get some work done on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has three views that you can swipe between. First is the Year view, which aggregates all 12 months with all of their days, a month view, which has little red dots for events and the agenda view, which is a vertically scrollable grid of events. Sadly, year view doesn't show little dots for when there's an event, despite the screen being large and high-res enough to allow it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an event is pretty straight-forward - you just hit the New event toggle in month and agenda view and start choosing the name, if it's a birthday memo, dates and times, the time zone and you can add reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ring tone, volume, snooze interval and note. The app also offers a world clock, a stop watch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is pretty simple to use - it has big, thumbable keys. In order to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.) you just have to turn the smartphone sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app lets you create complex notes with text, images and hand drawn notes. You can even set a password for your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tools folder is preloaded with a few apps that you usually get from the market. There's a Flashlight app, a sound recorder and a 3D compass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a backup and restore app, which does just what it says ion the tin - it backs up your Oppo Find 7a's data, settings and apps. You can schedule a backup, choose whether to backup multimedia files, etc. You can later restore your backup but you'll need to export it first as the app doesn't auto upload the backup to cloud services (like HTC's or Samsung's does).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The O-Cloud app is another backup&amp;restore app, but it looks like it can only backup your contacts, text messages and can be used to Find your phone remotely. There doesn't seem to be any real cloud storage involved or any interaction with the previously mentioned Backup and Restore app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable file manager out of the box. Its interface is laid out over two tabs, the first one organizes files by category, while the second is a traditional folder browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be copied, moved, deleted, renamed and compressed to ZIP (and ZIP files can be extracted). Batch operations are supported. The folder browser has list and grid views and you can change the sorting method. The system can be encrypted and password protected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also has built in DLNA and FTP server support, which makes it easy to access multimedia and general files on another device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Permission Monitor app. Here you can check the allotted permissions to all installed apps and even restrict some or all of them - i.e. cut off the ability of an app to send SMS messages. You can search either by app or by permissions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a comes with a GPS/GLONASS receiver. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. If rough positioning will do, Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are on it. Wi-Fi positioning can work even if Wi-Fi is disabled or you can turn this off to save battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7a comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution already. The public transport option can be very useful too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps show alternative routes and you can see alerts if there are any potential holdbacks along your route like construction zones, traffic jams and so on. Google's involvement with the live traffic info crowd-sourcing app - Waze - seems to be paying off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also supports the Street View mode, allowing you to see the landmarks you're looking for before you set off. That makes them much easier to find when you arrive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has added a small "designed for phones" warning for apps that don't have tablet interfaces. Those can look bad on the large screen, so it's nice to be forewarned.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7a is among the cheapest flagship smartphones you can get today. And while it costs less, the Find 7a does not skimp on quality and offers a great build, performance and user experience. You get top notch tech with a reasonable price tag - something you won't get from Samsung, HTC or LG any day soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not only that, but the Oppo Find 7a offers some unique features you can't get from any other device. First, there is the Rapid Charging functionality that allows you to charge your Find 7a super-fast. Then there is the Super Zoom interpolation to 50MP. The simplified Color OS based on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean is also a nice departure from the custom UIs we are all used to see. Finally, the Find 7a offers a high-quality 5MP front facing camera for high-res selfies - a feature of increasing importance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is powered by one of the best performing chipsets currently on the market - the Snapdragon 801. It comes with a beautiful 5.5" 1080p IPS display and offers an excellent build quality. The battery life is good too, especially for such powerful device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tell we really liked the Oppo Find 7a and we enjoyed the time we spent with the handset. It is quite the looker and performer, and yet it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. And while we still think it one of the most amazing bang-for-buck packages out there, we are still going to explore the competition out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The closely related Oppo Find 7 (sans the A) is probably the phone many people are looking forward to. It looks absolutely the same as the Find 7a, but boasts a QHD display and its CPU is clocked higher at 2.5GHz. The Find 7 is going to hit the shelves next month and should go for about ?100 higher than the ?399-priced Find 7a. Anyone, who wants a QHD flagship today - Oppo Find 7 is one of the best bets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S5 is currently one of the most popular smartphones. It isn't a massive upgrade over its predecessor, but it managed to make some important changes - a new modern design, a better display and chipset, a more capable camera, plus a fingerprint scanner and a heart-rate monitor. There is the water and dust protection, too. All these will cost you some good ?200 more than the Oppo Find 7a though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 offers even better camera than the Find 7a, plus it is water and dust proof. Its 5.2" 1080p display also looks great, while its clean Android KitKat implementation and the 3GB of available RAM are surely favorites for many. The phone has just hit the shelves and it costs some 300 euro more than the Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G Pro 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are more likely alternatives if you are shopping for a gadget like Oppo Find 7a. They are all Snapdragon 800-powered phablets with 3GB of RAM, with 1080p displays, 13MP rear cameras and Android 4.4 KitKat. LG G Pro 2 has a huge 5.9" IPS display and brings a plethora of software features and customization options to the table, while the 5.7" Super AMOLED Galaxy Note 3 is all about the S-Pen and its unique integration in the UI. You can get the LG G Pro 2 for about ?80 higher than the Oppo Find 7a, while the Galaxy Note 3 is exactly on par with the Find 7a pricing, which is dangerously close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G Pro 2 ? Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7a is indeed a great flagship and an amazing opportunity for those who want the best tech on a reasonable price. Find 7a is a great package of hardware and software features, one that everyone will be happy to work with. And if that's not enough for you, there is always the Find 7.</paragraph>
