			<paragraph>Beside all its extras, the successor of the famous Samsung D500 can also pride itself on having a 2 megapixel camera. And what are its pros and cons? The answer is to be found in this review. It features many sample photos, 3 sample video records as well as a comparison with two rivals - Nokia N90 and Sony Ericsson W800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual phone used in this review is Samsung D600E - it is the same as Samsung D600, but it supports EDGE and it is tri-band, not quad-band. The cameras in D600 and D600E are absolutely the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you all can see, photo-mobile phones are no longer a fashion craze. Step by step, they have grown into high quality devices, which are slowly, but surely getting into our daily practical life. Currently, the market with mobile devices is offering a lot of 1 megapixel camera phones, which manage to substitute any cheap compact digital camera, made to solely take the so called moment snapshots. Sony Ericsson and Nokia have also released a few mobile phones equipped with a camera of 2 megapixel resolution and auto focus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Entering the photo mobile hall of fame<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K750i (W800i, D750i) and Nokia N90 will soon have to share their company with another representative of the top-class photo mobiles equipped with a sensor with 2 megapixels resolution - the new elegant black Samsung D600, which comes to replace the successful D500 model. Just like its forerunner, it will be offered in an "E-version" with EDGE - the one we were given the chance to thoroughly test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us first shortly describe the phone. I dare foretell that this attractive black slider will surely attract the majority of phone fans. It looks extremely elegant and luxurious. Its high quality construction and comfortable keypad make the overall impression even better. Samsung D600E's size is 96 × 47 × 22 mm. It weighs 99 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung D600E</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a brilliant active display of a 240 × 320 pixels resolution able to show 262K colors. It also has an exceptionally high-quality stereophonic speakers, a TransFlash memory card slot, 75 MB built-in memory, Bluetooth and finally, the most significant option for this review - a 2 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of function possibilities, the phone should satisfy even the most pretentious users. It offers a big phonebook, an organizer with synchronization options, a MP3 player and videos in MP4 format, an email client as well as details like java games or WAP browser. And that is not all; the D600E model supports EDGE data transfers, so you can use it as a fast modem as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    A few interesting details </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera's equipment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Camera lens in D600 is situated on the backside of the device. Unlike the one of its forerunner Samsung D500, however, it is not situated on the backside of the front sliding part, and thus does not remain hidden, when the phone is closed. A bulky silver frame partly protects it from scratches. The lens is accompanied by a tiny mirror that facilitates taking self-portraits and the flash diode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On one of the sides of the phone there is a special button, which opens the camera application and activates the shutter release function. You will have to use your thumb to control it for the phone is not designed to take pictures when held horizontally. The photo application menus are displayed vertically. The same holds true for ready pictures, which do not snap over, but remain as if turned upside down, "in the vertical".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp; Camera with flash diode and mirror ? shutter release button is mounted on the right sideway of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though a horizontal hold with both hands would have been handy, the vertical way also seems to be fine. The only problem lies in the location of the lens, which is ideal resting place for one's pointing finger, so pay attention not to cover the lens. The shutter release is activated by the confirming central key or by the already mentioned side button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the phone is not equipped with auto focus lens. Its focal distance is steadily fixed, just like it is in the common photo mobiles. This results in slightly out of focus photos when shooting from a close distance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Quality photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At a first glance, the camera control application seems to be quite unsophisticated. When you start it from the menu, you will be inquired whether you are going to take pictures or shoot video, or whether you need to enter the picture gallery. If you press and hold the sideway button, you can start taking pictures immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung offers three types of viewfinders - the fullscreen one, the type with added grid and the most practical type - the one, which frames the exact part of the scene. To quickly switch between them press asterisk. The zoom-in indicator stays in the right margin of the display. The setup indicator for the exposure compensation is located in its bottom part. These indicators disappear after a few seconds, but if you press any of the ways of the navigator button, which controls the above-mentioned functions, the indicators pop out again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Viewfinder across the whole display ? viewfinder in the form of a block, which matches the picture format </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a 2x digital zoom; the zoomed-in pictures are resampled to full size, the final result is quite good. A bit surprising is the lack of a bigger zoom for the pictures in lower resolutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung offers various advanced photo settings in addition to the exposure compensation options. For example, it is equipped with a four-step setup for the ISO sensitivity (automatic, 100, 200, 400), which is an unprecedented feature for a photo mobile phone. It also offers three exposure metering options - evaluative, center-weighted and spot mode. Here is an explanation article about the metering in general from DPReview.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These settings are somewhat buried in the third level of the context menu. Their pre-selections, however, can be promptly changed by pressing the relevant key on the numeric keypad. For example, 6 stands for sensitivity, 3 stands for the exposure metering selection. The other keys are each assigned to a particular function. In this menu you will also find a 7 step option for changing picture size - from a full resolution of 1600 × 1200 pixels down to a display size, i.e. 320 × 240 pixels. The unusual size of 240 × 180 pixels is meant to help you attach and send pictures in MMS. It also allows for playing with interesting frames. Image quality or in other words file compression in JPEG format is available in 4 steps. The camera offers a night photo mode as well as an option for white color balance according to the type of light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera setup options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A separate menu contains the sound settings. You can choose among several types of shutter sound. Zooming and modifications in the exposure compensation can also be accompanied by a selected sound motive. Fortunately, all sounds are possible to deactivate if necessary. In the pre-selection menu you will also find an option for pictures titles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The setting for the main photo functions are located inside the menu, accessed by the left context key. Among others, here you will find a shooting mode selection (single shot, multi shot and mosaic shot), color effects, decorative frames for MMS, flash settings, and the self-timer option. The flash can be activated automatically in accordance with the light conditions. It can be set to work during the capture only, or to be constantly on, as a flashlight. In this last case it can be instantly activated by simply pressing the zero number key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last two items in the menu are the picture gallery and the help-list, which shows the way functions are assigned to the phone's keys. The first position is reserved for activation of the video shooting mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Picture viewer and image editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The taken pictures are saved into the gallery, which is situated in the phone's memory. The manufacturer has prepared memory space of 75 MB, but if this is not enough you can use the memory card slot. When you view pictures, you can set the phone to display three thumbnails with file info, or a matrix of nine thumbnails without info. When you select a picture, it opens across the whole display. To zoom in, you need to use the sideway buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Saving pictures in the phone and their viewing </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selected picture can be sent out directly from the gallery through Bluetooth, via email or in a multimedia message. The pity is that the email client is not capable of sending a file bigger than 200 KB. As the phone backs up direct printing, you can connect it to a printer through a USB cable or Bluetooth and send your pictures straight there. The picture files can be deleted, moved or renamed. The picture folders can be sorted by name, type, and size or creation date. You can even make a slide show with your pictures by arranging that they get displayed continuously in time intervals of 1 or 3 seconds. To do so you will need a special cable that is delivered together with the phone. Once you have connected the phone, you can start your presentation on the TV screen. The same principle is applicable to video records. The con of the picture gallery is that it does not use folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has an unsophisticated image editor. Here are some of its options: picture flip and rotation; inserting frames, emoticons or clip-arts; adjusting color, brightness and contrast; color tones and photo effects.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Jazzy video is something we already know<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides static pictures, with Samsung D600 you can create your own video records. Video options available here are similar to the ones in Samsung E720. The same holds true for the quality of the clips, which is superb, having in mind that the device we are talking about is a phone. Videos with high-quality settings have a resolution of 352 × 288 pixels and are able to catch even quite fast movements. Video records are saved in MP4 format. You can also set lower resolution parameters and a saving mode in 3GP format, which is more convenient if you are going to send your videos in MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Viewfinder in video mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like pictures, videos can be compressed in four quality levels. The phone has a white color balance option, color effects, a night mode, a self-timer function and a flash. The length of the video records is limited in two ways: a maximum of 300 KB for MMS and with limit by the free memory space only. I like the fact that the audio record can be switched off in the middle of the shooting process. Zoom is also available, but its range is pretty limited and the zooming is much too slow. On the other hand, here - unlike other phones - the zoom process is not immediate, but consists of several small steps - it's almost smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VIDEO:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: In order to open the above sample photos, you need the QuickTime video player. Press on links to download the records to your computer and then open the downloaded ZIP file. The files are approximately 1 MB in size.&nbsp;</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A lot of settings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After having gone through all lengthy "details" we have finally come to the point of our review. Let us now pay special attention to sample photos. Let me start right away with one of those pictures, I took in piles during the testing process - a photo of my pointing finger. The lens is mounted somewhat inconveniently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: the sample photos have been resampled to 800 × 600 pixels for faster downloads. The more important sample photos are shown in full size. In such case the link takes you to a file of up to 400 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;There is no doubt that in the beginning you will take plenty of faulty pictures, just like the one above </paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the factors that play especially important role for the quality of a certain picture is its image sharpness. Here Samsung seems to suffer certain difficulties, caused by its fixed focus. The sample pattern taken from about 1.5 meters reveals this weak spot quite clearly. Even though the phone takes good pictures from far distance, it is practically useless for macro photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: the strong noise in the testing pattern photo is caused by the low lighting. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Sharp image photos from greater distance only</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difficulty that the Samsung D600E has with focusing at shorter distance may turn to be quite unpleasant if you decide to scan texts. It is better to shoot from a distance, for the text will be easy to read considering the high resolution of the sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  It is better to scan text from a distance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The zooming-in process  is nothing special, but it is applicable in practice. Pictures are captured in full size, which causes a certain downgrade in its quality, but it is still possible to look at. Besides, when I think of the useless 20x digital zoom of Nokia N90, the solution offered by Samsung seems to me much clever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Samples of the digital zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now I would like to pay more attention to the proper exposure settings. Samsung D600's camera surprised me with its accurate automatic exposure. I guess most of you will come to use exposure compensation  rarely. What disappointed me was the exposure compensation implementation - it feels like nothing but a software manipulation additionally applied to the taken image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Picture taken with automatic exposure ? +2 exposure compensation ? -2 exposure compensation </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the high contrast scenes, the phone managed them quite fairly. And once again, I tried to help it by using the exposure compensation option in order that the light sky did not have such a strong impact on the final picture. It worked out - the second picture looks somewhat better than the first one. The last picture is for a demonstration only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;Automatic exposure ? -1 exposure compensation ? -2 exposure compensation ? +1 exposure compensation </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can expect, I also tested the metering options, which were best applicable in a dark passage. I used evaluative metering in the first picture and spot metering in the second one, where the passage details are well visible, but the environment is overexposed. This function can be sometimes quite practical indeed. In spot metering only the middle part of the picture is taken into account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Evaluative... ? ... and spot metering</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the automatic settings worked well, I did not make any big use of the manual white balance. Various settings are displayed in the pictures below. Even though the weather was cloudy (manually setup cloudy mode is used in the second picture), the first picture, where balancing is set automatically, reflects reality the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    White balance: automatic ? cloudy ? sunny ? fluorescent </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatics met my expectations for the ISO sensitivity as well. Higher sensitivity is used when necessary only - to keep the shutter speed high enough in low light. It's interesting to note that some digital cameras show more noise at ISO 400, than what we see in our Samsung D600 ISO 400 sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   ISO sensitivity at 100 ? at 200 ? at 400</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may find the flash diode  useful, especially when the light is low. Unfortunately, it is quite weak and seems to be practically helpful only for pictures taken from no more than a meter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Shooting with flash at a distance of approximately 75 cm ? flash at a 2 meters distance is useless </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Later I put a teddy bear in a dark corridor, leaving a strike of light to fall over it through the transparent glass of a door. The first picture was taken in automatic mode; the second one was made in night mode. As both pictures do not differ almost at all, my logical conclusion is that the night mode is nothing but an increase of the ISO sensitivity to maximum. The last picture is taken once again with a flash and activated night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   It is useless to fuss about the setup of the night mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D600 surprised me with its color effects  menu. Beside the standard black&amp; white, sepia and inverse conversion, the phone also offers old-photo effect, drawing and even emboss. Pictures can be taken with simulated fog or moon light mode on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Picture without color effects ? emboss ? old photo ? drawing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you attach photographs to multimedia messages, have a closer look into the fun options. You will definitely find something that will liven up your pictures. The phone offers a selection of classic frames, various entertaining masks etc. To my disappointment, D600 takes framed pictures in the lowest possible resolution only.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Comparing Samsung D600 to its competitors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I did my best to go and test Samsung D600's camera abilities at precisely the same places, where I took the pictures for the comparative review between Sony Ericsson W800 and Nokia N90. Even though at that time the light conditions were much better, the comparison published below will give you at least a general idea of what you can expect from each mobile. Unfortunately, we are not able to test the first two models all over again, for we no more have them in our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N90:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sony Ericsson W800:  Samsung D600:  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N90: &nbsp;Sony Ericsson W800:&nbsp;&nbsp;Samsung D600:&nbsp; </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N90:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sony Ericsson W800:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Samsung D600:&nbsp; </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It is a success<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that Samsung D600 can join the two current top-class photo mobiles Sony Ericsson K750 (D750, W800) and Nokia N90. No matter how many minuses we have mentioned in this review, the new Samsung D600 belongs to the group of the best photo mobiles, being so not only due to its brilliant resolution characteristics. Its weakest characteristic, if compared to the competitors, is its fixed focus. As photo mobiles tend to be used mostly for taking close pictures, Samsung definitely loses points here. Besides that, I appreciate the fact that Nokia N90 and Sony Ericsson K750 (D750, W800) can be held and taken pictures with horizontally, just like one would do with a standard camera, while Samsung does not feature such an option. And that is not all. You will have to constantly pay attention not to cover the lens with your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera speed in Samsung could have been a bit higher, but put next to the other two competitor photo mobiles, which have to focus, it evens off. When you press the release button, you have to hold the phone still for at least one second. Phone's setup options and the fast function selection with shortcuts are quite pleasing. Another option that could have given Samsung a strong advantage, but is not to be found in the phone, is the possibility of saving EXIF information about taken pictures directly into their files, just like it works in common digital cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although I did not have the chance to compare identical photos, I think Samsung D600 camera capabilities are not a threat for Sony Ericsson W800/K750. I think, however, that D600 can successfully compete with Nokia N90 in two categories: picture quality (excluding the close ups) and price.</paragraph>
