			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Announced alongside the Facebook Home launcher, the HTC First for AT&amp;T is the first smartphone to feature the social network's Android add-on out of the box. Launching a dedicated "Facebook phone" isn't an unfamiliar affair for HTC - back in 2011, the Taiwanese manufacturer released the Salsa and ChaCha duo of entry-level devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook Home aside, the HTC First features a spec sheet, mostly taken from last year's top shelf Android smartphones. The highlights included a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset and a sharp 4.3" 720p Super LCD display for liking your Facebook friends' online rants. Here goes the full list of talents, which the HTC First has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick look at the HTC First's list of talents shows that the smartphone has a lot more to offer than simply featuring Facebook Home out of the box. Hardware wise, the device is as capable as just about any 2012 Android top dog, but with the added benefit of an impressively pocket-friendly form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unmodified Android experience, which the device offers, is also a pleasant surprise. It will certainly help the HTC First attract Android purists to its bandwagon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-expandable memory and lack of user-replaceable battery are on top of the smartphone's list of potential niggles. The former in particular, could be a deal-breaker for many, given the ever-increasing size of today's popular apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera is arguably also a bit of a letdown, as 8MP shooters find their way even in an increasing number of affordable handsets. Our guess is that, given the social networking aura of the First, its camera was likely not a priority. After all, most, if not all, of the images produced by it are likely going to end up viewed on another mobile device, with a square aspect ratio and an effect filter applied to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we will kick off the HTC First's review with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box covers the basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First comes in a retail box, bearing an AT&amp;T and Facebook logos. Inside it, you will find a charger, a USB cable, a couple of HTC stickers, and the usual set of leaflets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no headphones included in the retail box of the device. You will need to pick up a pair of those on your own dime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First sports one of the most understated designs we've encountered in quite some time, albeit with a noticeable resemblance to the first iPhone. No element on the phone's curved body pops out - it is sleek and clutter-free. The subtle branding on the back further enhances the minimalist looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is available in four color schemes -black, white, light blue, and red. The black colored version we've tested is easily one of the stealthiest phones available at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is phenomenal. The HTC First is made from soft-feeling polycarbonate, which feels pleasant, yet extremely sturdy. The display is covered by Corning's Gorilla Glass, so it should also manage the daily wear and tear with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC First size is extremely friendly to both your hand and pocket. The handsets measures 126 x 65 x 8.9 mm and its weight tips the scale at 123.9 grams. In an Android realm, where 5" screens are quickly becoming the norm in the high-end segment, the First feels like a breath of fresh air with its 4.3" unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3" Super LCD display of the HTC First is gorgeous. Its 720p resolution is a long way from the current crop of Android flagships, but, thanks to the phone's modest display size, it still makes for a Retina-beating pixel density of 342ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are good, and so is the contrast and sunlight legibility. Overall, the display makes for a great companion for gobbling up multimedia of any kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you fill find the almost invisible earpiece, accompanied by the front-facing camera, the ambient light and the proximity sensor. Below the display there is a trio of capacitive buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the left side. The microSIM slot and the microUSB port are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack are located on top of the handset. On the bottom you will find a great-looking loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top left corner of the handset's back reside the 5MP camera and its single LED flash. An AT&amp;T, Facebook, and HTC logos can be seen on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2000mAh non-removable battery of the HTC First propelled it to the impressive endurance rating of 57. This means that you phone will easily make it through more than two full days if used for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily. Most importantly however, the HTC First should be able to make it through a day of heavy use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the HTC First feels like a breeze. Thanks to its relatively modest screen size and rounded body, one-handed operation is a joy. The soft-feel polycarbonate feels grippy, so accidental drops are not likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the user interface of the smartphone, headed by Facebook Home.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Facebook Home comes preinstalled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most talked about feature of the HTC First for AT&amp;T is the addition of the freshly announced Facebook Home launcher into the device's preloaded software. You can take a quick look of the launcher in action in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you power-up the HTC First with Facebook Home switched on, you are greeted by a lockscreen, which displays your friends' photos on the entire screen area. You can swipe through the available photos and like or leave a comment under the photos - straight from the lockscreen, without even unlocking the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen also shows useful notifications. They can be removed with a swiping gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A circular icon at the bottom which has your profile photo gives you access to the launcher's features via three shortcuts. They include one for messaging, one for opening the app launcher, and one for accessing your last used app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher shows the most commonly used applications. A strip at the top has shortcuts for updating your Facebook status, uploading a photo, and checking-in places. A full-blown app launcher is also available by swiping to the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you access the Facebook messages via the lockscreen shortcut, you have the option to activate the much talked about chat head functionality. The latter brings an icon to the screen of the device, which helps you access your conversation with a friend of your choosing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The implementation of chat heads is arguably one of the handiest features, which Facebook Home has on offer. It makes communicating with your Facebook friends quite seamless and might cause some trouble even for the established IM apps down the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook Home options menu is straightforward. It also allows you to switch Facebook accounts or turn the launcher off altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Facebook Home works mostly as advertised - while it won't fit all tastes, the launcher offers fairly deep and seamless integration with the most popular social network and is bound to get better with time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Facebook Home switched off, the HTC First offers plain vanilla Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. Despite not being the latest version of the OS, Android 4.1.2 still offers the most important Jelly Bean goodies, including Google Now and Project Butter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unlock screen offers access via shortcuts to Google Now and the camera. There are no surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Jelly Bean homescreen shares many similarities with the one we were first introduced to in Ice Cream Sandwich. There are five homescreen panes, none to be added or removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The docked apps tray allows up to four shortcuts to be placed within this dock, surrounding the app drawer shortcut in the middle. Any of the shortcuts can be customized by dragging icons into and out of the tray, and you can even create folders by dragging icons on top of one another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A permanent fixture is the Google Search bar at the top of the screen, which stays in place as you scroll the homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a redesigned clock and date icons in the top left, followed by a larger Settings icon. The clear notifications button has also been refreshed and it looks much sharper now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the usual swipe to remove functionality, notifications can be expanded by dragging downwards with two fingers to reveal additional information. For example, you can view meeting or message reminders directly in the notification area, and even email the recipients directly from the notification bar. Viewing Google+ photos or captured screenshots can also be done with this gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer features two tabs - Apps and Widgets - that feature side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you automatically move into the Widgets tab. There's also a shortcut next to the tabs, for quick access to the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps and widgets are ordered alphabetically and there's no other sorting option or a way to manually rearrange them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing a shortcut or widget works as you would expect - you press and hold to grab it and then position it somewhere on the homescreen. While you're dragging, an Uninstall field will appear along the top of the screen, where you can drop widgets into to remove them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being resizable both vertically and horizontally (some can be resized only in one direction), widgets in Jelly Bean automatically adjust their size to fit where you want to put them. This is especially useful on a homescreen filled with widgets. Also, if you drag one widget on top of the other, it will make space for itself by forcing the icons underneath to rearrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To resize a widget, you tap and hold on it and then release it. Four handles will appear on its sides, allowing you to change the widget's size in the direction you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are created much in the same way as in the shortcut dock; you simply drag one shortcut on top of another. By default, a new folder won't have a label, but you can name it by opening it and tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only as much as needed to fit the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recent apps button brings up a list of your recently-accessed applications. It displays thumbnails of the applications which you can press to open quickly, or swipe to the side to remove.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now is, in the simplest of terms, Android's version of Siri for iOS, albeit much more integrated into the operating system. Besides being able to talk to it, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards, which give you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First is powered by a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset, whose CPUs tick at 1.4GHz. The GPU is Adreno 305. While the smartphone is far from today's crop of high-end Android smartphones, it easily does better than last year's batch of flagships. See how it fared below.</paragraph>

		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook is the stock Android app, which hasn't been changed since its major redesign with the introduction of Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's made up of three tabs that you can switch between with sideways swipes. The middle tab is the default one, listing all of your contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name, and viewed as first name or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's regular search as you type too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick contacts feature triggers on tapping a contact image to bring up a tabbed popup window. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers or addresses. These tabs can be navigated with sideways swipes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view displays the contact's name along with a star to favorite a contact and a Settings button that lets you edit, share or delete a contact, as well assign custom ringtones to them or set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under that is a list of all contact info sorted by category - phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts that the phonebook displays can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even group (so you can hide all contacts that don't belong in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two major tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is readily thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer features the new neon-blue on black theme, but hasn't grown any new functionality. There's still no smart dialing, which is a real shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is just the first tab of the phone app, the other two being the Call log and the Favorites tab (you get the same in the Phonebook). In the Call log, you can't delete individual entries, which was mildly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call quality of the HTC First was good. We found nothing to frown at on this instance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual but with some improvements. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. A cool new feature is that you can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts work here too and there's a call shortcut at the top of the screen when viewing a thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts on the bottom of the screen are new email, search, labels, refresh and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input is handled by the standard Android Jelly Bean keyboard. There are no surprises here. Voice typing is also at your service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is the Make available offline feature - it lets you easily select multiple online albums and download them for offline viewing. The Gallery app supports online albums like Picasa (but not Facebook) and you can set it to sync photos only over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the single photo view is updated too - above the photo are several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a capable image editor on board. It can be accessed from a small icon from the bottom left hand-side corner, and offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles editing videos and it's quite feature rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and trim their start and end points, you can add titles and effects (including transition effects) add music and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is far from perfect - you get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video but that's it. There's still no dedicated videos app (you have to go through the Gallery). The player however, includes support for the the DivX and XviD codecs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First comes with the latest stock Music app. It has the same side-scrollable tabs like much of the other stuff in Jelly Bean and comes with plenty of updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are used to organize your music library - there's Recent, Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is running, the lockscreen features the album art and track info for the current song along with simple playback controls. The notification area also lets you control the playback via an expandable notification.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First audio output came out pretty impressive as is the case with most recent HTC smartphones. It did great in the active external amplifier part of the test, posting great scores all over the field. In addition it had volume levels higher than the majority of smartphones out there, including the Apple iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, the only area of the First performance that degrades is when you plug in a pair of headphones. Volume levels remain at the same high level, too, so the overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 5MP shooter at your disposal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First's camera captures images with a resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. The interface is stock Jelly Bean one, thus quite intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC First takes some surprisingly good photos. When viewed at 100% magnification they certainly look a bit oversharpened, but when fit to the computer screen they look great. The colors come out natural most of the time and the amount of resolved detail is on a really nice level for a 5MP cam. Expectedly, noise levels and the resulting noise suppression smear quickly start to become an issue in low light conditions. Other than that the camera has a relatively wide aperture at F2.0, which unlike what the small number difference would suggests, lets in almost double the light a regular F2.8 aperture would.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video camera does FullHD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder's interface is no different than the UI of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FullHD videos captured by the HTC First are nothing spectacular, but we've seen way worse, so we wouldn't complain. The action is smooth, the colors are fine. The resolved detail could have been better, but again, we've seen much worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are shot with a bitrate of almost 20Mbps. The sound is mono only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample, captured with the HTC First.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also prepared an untouched video sample from the HTC First camera for direct download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First covers every connectivity base out there with ease. From quad-band GSM/HSDPA, through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, all the way to NFC, the device ticks all boxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AT&amp;T's lovely LTE network is on board as well. It worked flawlessly in the New York City area where we tested the device out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is the default browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First comes with Google Chrome as a default web browser out of the box. The interface hasn't changed since Chrome's launch for Android and is clean and minimalist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop buttons next to tabs and settings buttons. You can switch between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous on settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi access, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's options, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, while Chrome excels in many areas, it falls short on the one that could be a deal-breaker for many of Android users and this is Flash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First comes without a preinstalled office editor. You will have to hit the Google Play Store if you really need one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar's functionality is as good as ever. There are four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app defaults to desk clock mode that looks a lot like the lockscreen. The usual alarm functionality is still present - you can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ringtone and label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC First comes with a GPS receiver, which also supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of the US available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache New York City and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store enjoyed a major overhaul recently, which brought an extra dash of eye candy to its looks, while retaining the same functionality. Running on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, the HTC First has access to the latest available apps. Still, don't go overboard with installing every app you see, as your storage is pretty limited due to the lack of microSD card slot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a lot more to the HTC First than Facebook Home. With solid build quality, minimalist looks, pocket-friendly size, and capable hardware, the handset is arguably the most appealing mid-range Android smartphone at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were most surprised by seeing an unmodified Android OS on the device out of the box. It is the only such option available in the US at the moment, this side of a Google Nexus device. There's no unnecessary carrier bloatware too - a welcome occurrence given the lack of much available storage on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of expandable memory is probably the HTC First's biggest shortcoming. With only 12GB of available space on board, a user should be careful about its use - a tough task when a high-profile video game can easily come close to two gigs of required space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the HTC First has a gorgeous screen and the 5MP camera shoots better stills than you would expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC First is keenly priced at $99.99 with a two-year contract - a fair price given the smartphone's capabilities and the current state of the competition. Should you choose to shop around, here are some options worth taking a look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T will offer slightly better camera, but smaller battery to power its bigger screen for the same price. If you are into HTC Sense, the One X is worth a look.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III is also priced at $99.99. It barely needs an introduction, given the tens of millions sold already. The HTC First however, one-ups the South Korean on pocketability.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you feel like going against the mainstream, the Pantech Discover is a viable option, too, with a bargain basement price tag of $49.99. It offers a large screen, a replaceable battery, stereo speakers, and a 12.6MP camera.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M for Verizon comes closest to the HTC First in terms of size/performance ratio. However, its qHD display is seriously inferior to the S-LCD unit of the HTC offering. The DROID RAZR M is priced at $49.99 with a two-year commitment to the Big Red.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There is hardly a smartphone, which matches the HTC First's talents completely. The so-called "Facebook phone", despite some of its limitations, is a perfect fit for anyone who thinks that an Android smartphone with a screen larger than 4.5" is going too far. It is therefore, the sidekick, which perfectly complements the HTC One flagship.</paragraph>
