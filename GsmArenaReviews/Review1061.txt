			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 is the latest addition to the L-series and rightfully takes charge of a lineup that's known for attractive styling and wallet-friendly prices. It obviously made no sense to LG to start from scratch and the L9 is happily reusing bits and parts from nearly all of its fairly recent smartphone siblings. As far as we can tell, it does so rather well and the resulting mix looks like a great balance between price and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 has the screen size of the current LG flagship and the qHD resolution is quite reasonable. It's powered by the same chipset as the latest Prada phone while the design is strongly reminiscent of the LG Optimus 4X HD and the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see what else might pop out of the bag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we have here clearly isn't the best dual-core chipset on the market, but there's more than enough to keep Ice Cream Sandwich at cruising speed. Well yes, we would've loved to have Jelly Bean but even the flagship is still waiting. In terms of hardware though, the Optimus L9 has a number of advantages over some of its direct competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the L9 is a package that has just about everything people look for in a modern smartphone and the right price tag should help users forgive the omissions. Quad-core CPUs and HD screens are well above the L9's price range and not everyone needs 8, 12 or 13 megapixel stills. It makes perfect sense for LG to try and fill a blank spot right below its premium line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We now have an entire review to try and find out how well it actually did. Follow us on the next page, where we start as usual with unboxing and the traditional hardware tour.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Optimus L9<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box covers just the basics, but that's what everyone else is doing these days. You get an A/C adapter, a microUSB cable for charging and data connections, and a single-piece headset in matching white color. Our test unit didn't have any NFC tags, which are otherwise supplied with most LG smartphones of late, but this could be a region-specific feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus L9 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 has the same screen diagonal and the same angular styling as the Optimus G and the Optimus 4X HD. The three handsets are near identical in size, the L9 being just a tad thicker - but nothing to make an unpleasant difference. At 131.9 x 68.2 x 9.1 mm, the L9 is still nicely pocketable and it's also the lightest of the three at 125 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By some weird coincidence, we had the white version of all three phones for review and that helped us spot an important difference. The LG Optimus L9 and the 4X HD have white screen bezel that matches the handset's paintjob, while the Optimus G's bezel is always black, whatever color version you choose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The finish is different too: the L9 is entirely made of plastic, like the Optimus 4X HD, while the Optimus G rightfully gets the flagship treatment with a glass-covered back. Overall, the L9 is clearly based on the Optimus 4X HD but some subtle changes work well in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, the tacky leather-like texture at the rear is gone and the L9 uses a simpler, more sensible pattern. We tend to prefer hardware Home keys and the L9 obliges, as opposed to the 4X HD, which goes for capacitive only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 is made entirely of plastic and the global version (as opposed to the T-Mobile-exclusive model) we have here is available only in white. The double silver frame running all along the sides of the handsets is borrowed straight from the Optimus 4X HD. All ports and controls are squeezed in the tight space between the frames, which has the same textured pattern as the battery cover. The phone offers quite a secure grip actually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is almost completely occupied by the 4.7-inch qHD display. Above it we find the earpiece, the proximity sensor and the small VGA camera for video chats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just below the screen are the capacitive Back and Menu keys surrounding the hardware Home button. The backlighting of the touch keys is configurable in the settings and you can have it always on/off or choose between several auto-turn-off intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Optimus L9 has the volume rocker, though there is more to it than meets the eye. It actually packs three keys - volume up, volume down and a small middle key for instantaneous access to the Quick Memo app, which we'll talk about later on in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side has the single Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9's top is where the 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary microphone are. The second mic is used for both noise cancellation during calls and for stereo audio during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port and the primary microphone are at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back features the 5 MP camera lens along with a single LED flash and a loudspeaker grille at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the rather thin battery cover reveals the SIM compartment, the 2150 mAh battery and the microSD card slot. The bad news is the memory card isn't hot-swappable - you'll need to pull the battery out to access the microSD slot, which is placed right below the SIM compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the phone will warn against, it can be tricked to change SIM cards without restart. If you turn airplane mode on and swap the SIM, you'll be good to go as soon as airplane mode is turned back off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NFC antenna is on the battery cover itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were preparing to be impressed by the LG Optimus L9's battery life. It is powered by the same 2150 mAh unit as the 4X HD and has fewer pixels to worry about, and only two processor cores. The L9 did get a respectable rating of 42h, which however isn't all that much compared to the 40h score of the 4X HD. Obviously, the power-saving core of the Tegra 3 chipset is making up for much of the difference in power consumption.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 4.7-inch qHD display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9's 4.7" qHD screen (960 x 540 pixels) uses IPS technology and provides better contrast and viewing angles than the standard LCDs. The display has a density 234 pixels per inch, and while that's far from a standard-setting number, images are pleasantly detailed and crisp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As long as you don't stare from too closely even small fonts are sharp enough and there's no pixelation. The L9 cannot quite match the deep blacks of AMOLED and the resulting contrast, but it's doing quite well in its price range.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 could be well out of some people's comfort zone with that 4.7" display but LG did a splendid job of using the available space. The nicely shaped sides and back of the handset allow a comfortable grip - more so than the 4X HD. The textured back looks somewhat simple, though by no means cheap, but is more secure that the fancy glass finish of the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L9 is well-built and quite good-looking, which should hardly be a surprise. The L-series is more about looks than specs (even though the L9 is trying to raise the bid with a qHD screen and a dual-core processor). LG must've recognized the need of a reasonably powered and attractive alternative that costs significantly less than flagships. On the outside, it seems they got it right with the Optimus L9.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ice Cream Sandwich and Optimus UI 3.0 in charge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 runs Android 4.0.4 ICS with the custom Optimus UI 3.0 on top. It is the same combo as in the flagship Optimus G and we think many users will appreciate the cool visuals and rich functionality of the custom LG skin. The L9 is not even nearly as powerful as the Optimus G, but has enough to deliver reasonably smooth performance and solid Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get started with a video demo of the Optimus L9 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Koreans have treated Ice Cream Sandwich with their highly customized style but things look subtler than usual, tidy and uncluttered. We have to admit we really like what LG did with their latest Optimus UI and it is on par or sometimes even better than TouchWiz on the Galaxy S III (maybe not, after the Premium Suite update).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the mostly bright color themes and the white system menus look very nice on the high-res screen. Many aspects of the phone's behavior can be customized, you can go to as small detail as the capacitive key backlight, the icon set and the transition between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android 4.0 interface is littered with some extra little touches that really make using the UI an enjoyable experience, particularly if you've seen ICS on other devices - small tweaks that pop up here and there will surprise you with their usefulness. We'll be sure to point them out to you as we go along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has implemented a cool swipe lockscreen, which lets you see what's "underneath" as you unlock the phone. You can also place up to four shortcuts that will unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the lockscreen clock style as well as the four icons at the bottom with whichever app you choose. That's how it should be done - in HTC's Sense for example, the lockscreen shortcuts always repeat the homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also change the unlock mechanics - you can choose between swipe, face unlock, pattern, PIN and password protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're at it, the shortcut bar at the bottom of the homescreen is one of the major changes in the Optimus UI 3.0. It can now fit up to 6 shortcuts and that's one more than what TouchWiz offers on the Samsung Galaxy S III. You don't have to use all available slots though - you can only keep the App Drawer shortcut if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the shortcuts are always visible on any of the homescreen panes. With the exception of the app drawer shortcut, you can rearrange, delete or replace any of these with shortcuts of your choosing, even folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a blank area of a homescreen allows you to add various customizations to your phone. The tabs along the bottom let you select the appropriate app, widget or wallpaper, which you can add to the homescreen of your choice. Gridlines will appear when you hold and drag an app or widget, allowing you to easily place it on the homescreen. Ice Cream Sandwich also allows you to resize most widgets, if you want them to take up more or less space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get a seven homescreens to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. You can also set the default homescreen to any of the panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has also enabled a ton of other customization to the the homescreen looks and behavior. There's a dedicated setting for looped homescreen scrolling and the so-called screen effect changes the transition effect between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between four pre-defined themes - each of them changes the icon set, the wallpaper and the app drawer and notification area base color. The available themes are Optimus (the default one), Biz, Cozywall and Marshmallow. The latter two are kind of cartoon looking and will appeal to the younger users only. The thing is, those themes don't change the context menus' color, the submenus, system apps, etc. And if you've chosen the pink Marshmallow theme, you'll constantly flip between the system's gray color and the theme's pink one when browsing the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite often miss another feature hidden within some LG phones - you can change the icons of the homescreen app shortcuts. If you tap and hold on an app and then release it, you'll get a small violet icon with a paintbrush. A tap on it will take you to a whole new section of the UI where you can choose an icon from hundreds of pre-defined ones or even create one that suits you. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area contains one of LG's ICS customizations in the ability to rearrange the toggle buttons shown here and you can also add and remove toggles from the edit menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you're playing something on the music player, quick controls will show up here. You can also drag notifications to the left or right to dismiss them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on board is of the new ICS variety, which shows you all of the currently running apps, and lets you stop them by swiping them to the left or right. It is accessed by holding down on the hardware home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two options at the bottom of the task switcher - to stop all running apps or open the task manager. The task manager also offers the option to stop everything that is currently running, but you can also uninstall apps from there and check your remaining storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reorder and uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu, accessed from the bottom right capacitive key, gives you the option of fitting more applications on one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has done a good job of its custom skin for Android ICS. It's nicely styled (if a little too colorful), feature-rich and yet quite tasteful and unobtrusive. We're impressed with the general speed of the phone too. Everything runs smooth and we have no complaints regarding the quality of use. For those who still need to put a number to it, our dedicated Synthetic Benchmarks follow.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks: Two Cortex-A9 cores still gets the job done<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus L9 is powered by the TI OMAP 4430 chipset with two 1GHz ARM Cortex-A9 CPU cores and the PowerVR SGX540. Sure, the L9 hardware is not the benchmark champion of every geek's dreams, but it's nowhere near the end of its lifecycle. In fact, it's more than adequate for the price range. Anyway, let's take a look how this one stacks among the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmark Pi is a simple single-threaded benchmark, so we know what we can expect from it. The Optimus L9 falls behind the Krait-powered and the latest quad-core smartphones, but comes close to its Cortex-A9 CPU siblings - the Galaxy S II and the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack offers multithreaded benchmarking, making it essential for testing dual and quad-core beasts. The Optimus L9 stacks the same as its dual-core siblings - the Galaxy S II and Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant is a composite benchmark (it tests CPU, GPU and I/O). The LG Optimus L9 scored almost the same as the Samsung Galaxy S II, beats the Galaxy Nexus but was outrun by the Galaxy Note, Xperia S and naturally, all the quad-core beasts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another worthy composite benchmarks are AnTuTu and GeekBench. Here are the results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 uses the PowerVR SGX540 GPU and has a qHD screen to fill with pixels. Obviously that's a pretty tall order, which explains the rather poor showing in NenaMark 2. The L9 result is comparable with the Xperia S, but that one uses a 720p screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark isn't particularly kind to the Optimus L9, either, but the smartphone can take consolation in the fact that it matches the HTC One X result. We're using the Egypt test in offscreen 1080p mode so that results are directly comparable even though each device has a different screen resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is a JavaScript benchmark and as such isn't strongly affected by the number of CPU cores - it mostly reflects the raw performance of a single core and how optimized the JavaScript engine itself is. The Optimus L9 score is somewhere between the previous generation Galaxies and the iPhone 4S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark adds HTML to the equation - behind the scenes JavaScript computing won't do much if the web page can't update fast and smooth. Since BrowserMark got updated we don't have all the results from previous phones, but you can still get the idea. Interestingly, the Optimus L9 managed to beat the Galaxy S III here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vellamo score isn't too bad either. We only have the results of quad-core smartphones to compare the L9 performance to, but the difference isn't too huge, which bodes well for the LG mid-ranger.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG Optimus L9 is hardly the most powerful smartphone around and there are certainly be plenty of devices out there to give you faster ride around Android. However, it's no slouch either and it's raw power will be more than enough for the vast majority of the users.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Powerful phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Ice Cream Sandwich has, for the most part, very similar functionality to that found on previous Gingerbread iterations. It has a tabbed interface, in which the central tab lists all contacts alphabetically. Contact images, where available, are displayed and there's a quick alphabet scroll on the right. There's also a regular search bar on top of the contacts list. The other tabs are Groups and Favs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phonebook from getting messy - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on). The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact photo brings up the quick contacts keys. You can use them to call the contact, send them a message or email or view their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can join various contacts from Google, Facebook and Twitter. The Contacts app has GTalk integration and you can see statuses and IM or video chat directly from a contact's page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the name of a single contact brings up their details. From here, you can edit the contact's info by hitting the pencil icon in the upper right, while the star icon on the upper right will add them to your favorite contacts. Editing a contact is pretty straightforward; you can add or remove fields as needed, as well as specify the types of phone numbers, email addresses, ringtones and even add notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 had no trouble holding on to signal even in areas of poor coverage and the in-call audio is consistently good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer integrates the Call log, Contacts and Favorites, each within its own tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It's a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works for both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG Optimus L9. It scored an Average result, meaning you might miss a few calls in noisier environments if you don't keep an eye on it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 can handle all common message types: SMS, MMS and email. Email capability is excellent with support for Exchange available out of box, and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of SNS integration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts, and operates in much the same fashion as the Gmail one. If you add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy, although there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY, Swype, voice and handwriting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which features both portrait and landscape typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of speed and accuracy are commendable in both portrait and landscape. There's a dedicated setting that enables keypress vibrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Swype-like input as well (called Shape writer), though it's somewhat uncomfortably out of sight in the Input Language submenu. You need to enable Shape Writer instead of the standard QWERTY layout in the settings. Voice input is enabled too, as well as handwriting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 uses the standard Android ICS gallery. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen, and opening the contents of a group of photos causes them to transition into the same grids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo. There are plenty of editing options available, ranging from photo effects to cropping and rotation to red eye removal. The Share feature offers quick sharing via Email, Google+, Picasa, Memo, MMS, SmartShare, Social+ or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays images in full resolution. Zooming and panning is fast and smooth and there's little to no lag when doing it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music looks similar to the typical ICS version we're all familiar with, but steals a few tricks and UI elements from the revamped app we saw in the Optimus G. It can do the usual filtering by album and artist and you have alphabet search and regular search for finding songs quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth. The interface now has a metallic look to it instead of the dark grey theme of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets, which become available when you plug in a pair of headphones. Unfortunately there is no Dolby Mobile enhancement and no option to customize your own preset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're playing a song it also gets displayed in the notification area, where you can pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decently clean audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 did quite well in our audio quality test and easily put its premium 4X HD sibling to shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to active external amplifier the LG Optimus L9 managed excellent scores all over the field and garnished them with above average volume levels - a pretty solid performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was some degradation when we plugged in a pair of headphones, but nothing too bad. Some distortion crept in and the stereo crosstalk worsened, but none of those will be easy to detect with the naked ear. The drop in volume levels meant the L9 is only average on this occasion, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus L9 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on the LG Optimus L9 with RDS support. It can play over a set of headphones or the loudspeaker, but the headphones need to be plugged-in either way (they act as an antenna). You can also scan for radio stations, and save up to 48 channel presets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a list (with thumbs) of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can of course play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. Unfortunately the AC3 audio codec is not supported and some of the videos played without sound. There are no limitations for the bitrate, file size, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles (both Latin and non-Latin) are supported with settings for font, color, font and size. You can toggle subtitles on and off, but there's no option to manually point to a subtitle file, so the subtitle filename has to match the video filename.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing 5MP still photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 comes with an 5 megapixel camera, capable of capturing 2592 x 1944 resolution images. There is a single LED flash, but it won't be of much help in most low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the user interface to be quite convenient, though many of the important settings are inside the extended settings menu, so they take a while to toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there is no hardwired shutter key, pressing the volume rocker will snap a photo. It's not such a good idea though. First, the volume keys don't obviously have half press and second, it's hard to comfortably hold such a slim phone. Of course, there's the virtual on-screen shutter button as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can naturally change the resolution, ISO, white balance, focus mode (auto, face-tracking), shot mode (normal, continuous shot or panorama), geo-tagging on/off, preset scenes, color effects and brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Optimus L9 is a real let down. The resolved detail is poor, the noise levels are very high and contrast is pretty bad. The photos will be OK to publish down-scaled on social networks and similar, but by far not the best way to save your precious memories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few shots we've taken with the LG Optimus L9.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 joins the long list of tested devices in our photo comparison tool. The page of the tool has information on how to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see the Optimus L9 is not as capable as its 5MP competitors. It's not that bad, it's just not on par.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording sounds better than it actually is<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9's camera is capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps. The phone can simultaneously take photos while shooting a video and it supports continuous auto-focus (in fact, it's your only available focus option).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the quality of the clips is extremely poor, which takes most of the fun away. Videos looks like upsized VGA clips (at best) with extremely low resolved detail. It's so bad that it makes commenting on any other aspect of the videos pointless. Only the least demanding users and those who only watch the videos on the smartphone's screen itself will probably find the quality adequate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample we've uploaded on YouTube. Don't forget to switch to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a 720p video sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a 1080p@30fps (26MB) and a 720p@30fps (11MB) video samples for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our video comparison tool, the Optimus L9 didn't quite manage to match any of its competitors. Its quality once again turns to be quite miserable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 comes with a wide range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming and dual-band HSDPA with 21 Mbps of download and 5.76 Mbps of upload. Wi-Fi is has a/b/g/n support, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot capabilities. There is NFC and Bluetooth 3.0 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is an app that lets you control a DLNA network - you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone onto another device (e.g. a DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi Direct is a technology which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is in that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to an eventual Bluetooth demise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board in the form of a dedicated app called LG Tag+. From there you can create, read and send NFC tags. With NFC you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also store information, a profile preset or some action in a blank tag and then use it to make the phone perform an action every time you touch it - for instance launch a SatNav app when you touch the in-car tag or change your ringing profile when you touch your designated tag at the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you connect your phone to a computer via an USB cable a few options will pop up - charge only, media sync (via MTP protocol), USB tethering (to share your internet connection), LG Software mode or camera mode (using the PTP protocol).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the 3.5mm audio jack on top of the Optimus L9.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock web browser does a solid job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface is completely minimalist (it's the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar on top and a control bar at the bottom (with options hidden by default). The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view. The bottom control bar houses the back and forward keys, zoom shortcut, and the new window and bookmarks keys. By default it's hidden and you need to swipe the small visible gray line up to evoke it. It doesn't auto hide, instead you need to swipe it down manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser offers the ability to save a cached copy of any page you're currently browsing onto your phone. If you choose a website and go to 'save for offline reading', you can then open it from the Saved section of your bookmarks, even when you're no longer connected to the internet. This is great for long articles, as you can save them for those times when you don't have web access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 supports double tap zoom and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've pinched to zoom in, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find on page, always request desktop site and brightness options are available from the advanced menu. If you tap and hold on some text you get the usual markers and select/copy/find/web search/share options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a history section in addition to the Saved pages list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Adobe pulled the plug on the Flash for Android you can't find the installer within the Play Store. Of course, you can get the apk from XDA Developers or other place and install it by yourself. The Optimus L9 hardware is enough to handle most of the available Flash content on the internet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well-covered organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 comes with the usual set of organizing apps and there's a preloaded document viewer and editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office and it's one of the most advanced mobile editors we've seen. You can of course view documents - Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit mode offers almost a full set of options - text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables. If you're editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even creating a full PowerPoint presentation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also doubles as a file manager and integrates with Box.net.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 comes with the latest version of the Calendar app. The screen estate is split into two parts - one for the calendar and one for the agenda/daily/weekly view. This way you will always have your monthly view visible. The border line between the two sections is not fixed and you can easily move it. You can hide the monthly view completely, but you can't do the same with the other section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to enjoy the calendar in full screen without any additional views, just turn the phone landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. You can also view events from three different calendars: your phone, your email and Google groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a useful voice recorder and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app allows you to take notes and add media to them, such as images, audio, or location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called QuickMemo function is integrated in the phone's OS, allowing you to capture screen shots of anything (including the lockscreen!) and scribble notes over them like you would on the Galaxy Note - and of course the LG Optimus Vu. A simultaneous press of the up and down buttons of the volume rocker or a precise press on the small key between them will open the Quick Memo, while a simultaneous press on the Lock and the Home key will take a screen shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also weather, news and finance apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no dedicated Facebook or Twitter apps preinstalled. Luckily, the Social+ widget is here, along with the Facebook and Twitter contact sync. Once properly configured, the Social+ widget will show your Facebook news feed and Twitter updates, the latest Twitter mentions and your social messages. The gallery has Social+ integration so you can easily share photos onto Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 does come with the Google+ and Messenger apps. Google+ lets you view trending profiles, as well as feeds from all your circles, while the messenger app lets you quickly chat with any of your Google+ contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, while they do not come with the phone, you can always download the official Facebook and Twitter apps from the app marketplace.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store is where the apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Play Store lets you download various apps for your smartphone. Upon launch of the Play Store app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.). You can also see if updates are available for your currently installed apps by going to My Apps in the contextual menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps market - there you can find lots of free content and promotions exclusive for LG users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 managed to get a GPS lock in just about a minute without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app now lets you cache maps and will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, it turns out there's quite a lot to like about the LG Optimus L9. Its key selling point is the big screen, which is rather hard to come by in this price range. Retina levels of pixel density were out of the question - should we say, budget - but qHD doesn't look too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reasonably powerful hardware, nice looks, and excellent custom user interface are some more good reasons to choose the L9 if you are into big-screened smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing that might turn a few users away is the disappointing camera performance, though imaging isn't necessarily everyone's top priority. What could be more problematic is LG's poor reputation when it comes to updates. The Optimus L9 delivers soundly out of the box, but it is yet to make (if ever) the Jelly Bean waiting list. After all, there are at least two devices ahead of it in the pecking order and we've barely heard anything constructive about them just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Optimus L9's rather competitive price may make users more forgiving. The Optimus L9 costs about &#x20ac;260 which, as we are about to see, compares quite favorably to most of the direct competitors. In terms of hierarchy, the L9 would've been expected to stand against the likes of the Galaxy Premier, but it's actually way cheaper than even a Galaxy S III mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means is the Optimus L9 will have a seemingly easier challenge in the face of the Samsung Galaxy S Advance. The two handsets feature similar hardware, the Galaxy making up for its smaller screen with AMOLED technology and more storage. The S Advance might be able to get to Jelly Bean before its LG rival, but unless compact size and portability are a top priority, we'd suggest you side with the L9 here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has a smartphone to put against the L9, too - the Xperia P. It has a much smaller screen but of the same resolution and costs a few bucks less than the Optimus L9. Its advantages are the premium finish, the dedicated HDMI port, the soon-to-be-released Jelly Bean update and the clearly superior 8MP camera. On the other hand, the LG offers better battery backup and a slightly more powerful chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia P</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are looking to try something other than Android at this price point - the HTC Windows Phone 8S is pretty much your only option. The phone is quite the looker and is built to a flagship standard. It runs Microsoft's latest Windows Phone 8 but, again, fails to match the L9 screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Windows Phone 8S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the LG Optimus L9 seems to make itself pretty comfortable in its little niche. Flagship-sized screen and solid performance at an attractive price point is certainly a combo many will be happy with. And considering there's virtually no competition (at least until the Galaxy Grand arrives), the L9 has every chance of making it big. We'd say it will be well deserved.</paragraph>
