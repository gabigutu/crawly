			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5 (2016) is the centerpiece of the company's mid-range portfolio for the year. With its predecessor becoming a huge hit in developing markets, the company really needs the 2016 model to come out good and help keep Chinese makers at bay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick glance at the specs sheet shows that Samsung followed the "If it's not broken, don't fix it" saying to the letter. With the internals mostly unchanged, Samsung chose to focus on the design instead, hoping that the metal body will help its offering stand out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a bigger battery and the screen grew by .2", but that's mostly it with other changes being so minor that they mostly fall in the adjustments category. Here's the full scoop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal frame gives you a piece of mind as well as a nice feel in the hand. We'd certainly appreciate a bit of premium feel in an otherwise mid-range offering. However, it would mean nothing if it comes at the expense of proper smartphone experience. And since Samsung didn't feel the need to change the processing power from the previous generation Galaxy J5 we'd be sure to carefully check that. Perhaps supplying the newer Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and bumping the RAM to 2GB is all it took to keep the J5 (2016) relevant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not waste any more time and start digging in. Follow us onto the design and hardware section.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5 (2016) comes in an ordinary box, which doesn't contain much other than the basics. You get a handset and a moderately fast AC adapter (5.0V/1.55A) and a USB cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Galaxy J5 (2016) packs a slightly larger display than its predecessor and this has resulted in slightly larger footprint. The phone stands at 145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1 mm, so the good news is Samsung managed to keep the thickness of the phone almost unchanged despite the increase in battery capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the extra mAhs and the metal shell have added a bit of weight. The Galaxy J5 (2016) tips the scales at 159 grams compared to 146 grams of its predecessor. It's not unwieldy but you'll certainly feel its presence in your pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5 (2016) comes with a much needed design overhaul - gone is the generic plastic, which was sturdy but not quite premium looking or feeling, to be replaced by a nicely crafted metal frame. In short, you wouldn't have bought the first-gen Galaxy J5 for its looks. The story with this new one is different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame is chamfered at the front and back while the sides are finished in the phone's main color. They're also flat, for better grip. At first sight, you can't really tell that it's metal, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, the plain plastic cover of yesteryear is replaced by one that imitates brushed metal. While there's a camera bump, it's not irritating. We like how Samsung tastefully designed the main speaker grille next to it, too. The LED flash on the right side of the camera has the same cutout like the grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the Galaxy J5 (2016) display is surrounded by some bezel, but nothing overboard. Below it, there's Samsung's traditional home button surrounded by a capacitive Task switcher on the left and a Back button on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's a front-facing camera on the left with the LED flash unusually positioned on the opposite side. In the center, an earpiece, and a proximity sensor sit between them. Sadly, there's no ambient light sensor here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button is on the right while the volume rocker is on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, you'll find the microUSB port, the main (and only) mic as well as the 3.5mm headphone jack. The top is barren.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover reveals the 3,100mAh battery as well as the microSIM and microSD card slots. Notice the NFC chip on the back panel, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Galaxy J5 (2016) is a pleasure. Its metal frame and higher than average weight make up for a pretty nice feel in hand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5 (2016) is equipped with a 5.2" Super AMOLED display. The 1280x720 pixel resolution is slowly but surely dying, but is still favored by manufacturers in the lower part of the price spectrum. Even with it, the pixel density is an adequate 282ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with most of its Super AMOLED devices, Samsung has included a number of display modes. In Basic mode, colors are most accurate, whereas AMOLED cinema, they're least accurate. The nice middle ground between accurate whites and grays and punchy colors is AMOLED photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a Super AMOLED, the Galaxy J5 (2016)'s screen offers punchy and vibrant colors with great contrast. The display is decently bright at 338 nits. Tick the Outdoor mode checkbox, and brightness is cranked up to 476 nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, that's not enough to place the Galaxy J5 (2016) high enough on our Sunlight contrast chart.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) is offered in single-SIM and dual-SIM variants, so you can get some flexibility in terms of carriers and plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you get Wi-Fi, but it only operates on the 2.4GHz band, and there's no Wi-Fi ac support. There's GPS with A-GPS, Bluetooth v.4.0, and an FM radio receiver. NFC is also on board with a dedicated options menu in the Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired options include a microUSB port and a 3.5mm jack. The microUSB port can be used to attach an external accessory as it supports USB On-The-Go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Popping the rear cover of the Galaxy J5 (2016) reveals a 3,100mAh Li-Ion battery, that's user replaceable. It's whole 500mAh larger than the previous generation, so we expected it to perform much better, given the identical chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And indeed we see its benefits in some key components in our battery life test. The Galaxy J5 (2016) managed an endurance rating of 66 hours. Despite its excellent call time score, there's a lot to be desired from the video playback performance, as it draws way too much battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do measure standby battery drain, and even though it's not included explicitly in the scorecard, it has its influence on the overall rating. The stand-by time was excellent, but still couldn't fully make up for the poor video score.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) runs a TouchWiz-skinned Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and as a result comes with native support for an app manager, Doze mode, and Google Now on Tap among other tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is perfectly identical to the TouchWiz home of other Samsung phones. Even the number of columns is the same - 5 icons on a row, same as the A9 (2016).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification area is pretty busy by default. It starts with a scrollable line of quick toggles on top, then a brightness slider, then the S Finder and Quick connect buttons. You can hide them from the Edit option, which also lets you re-arrange the quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5(2016) user interface is fully themeable. We only got three themes pre-installed, but the Theme store has many more to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the latest iteration of TouchWiz manages to remain feature-rich, while also reasonably light on resources. As a result, it runs without glitches even on the dated Snapdragon 410 chipset. Speaking of which, follow us onto the benchmark section of the review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) uses its predecessor's chipset - while the Snapdragon 410 wasn't much in 2015, this year the quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A53 CPU seems downright disappointing. There's an Adreno 306 GPU on board, which too hasn't changed, but at least RAM is bumped to 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are newer and better alternatives on the market, but it seems Samsung has decided the Snapdragon 410 is good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start things off with GeekBench, which is great at giving us a reliable reading of raw CPU performance. Here, the Snapdragon 410 sits right below the Moto G 3rd Gen, which has the same configuration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the single-core component of the benchmark, the Galaxy J5 (2016) is far off the likes of the Acer Liquid X2, which features eight overclocked Cortex-A53 cores in the Mediatek MT6753.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 6 is a compound benchmark but the Galaxy J5 (2016) doesn't really have any particularly strong points so it understandably ranked quite low.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time for some GPU testing, where we don't really expect the Adreno 306 to shine. It manages just 1.8fps in the GFX3.0 Manhattan in 1080p, and 3.8fps in the onscreen test. Unsurprisingly, its predecessor achieved the same results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X (medium)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the benchmark scores are rather poor, which doesn't bode well for long term performance. While the fresh Marshmallow installation ran smoothly and we didn't experience any glitches, but TouchWiz does slow down a bit over time so things will probably be less rosy once you get all your apps up and running.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) is available as a single-SIM phone, but there's a dual-SIM version as well. On the latter, the SIM card manager lets you pick a preferred SIM for voice, text and data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode can be put on an automated schedule. When it's on, only priority notifications can get through hand you decide what counts as "priority" - it can be anything from calls from select contacts to reminders from key apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our loudspeaker test, the Galaxy J5 (2016) scored a Below Average mark. Sadly, the phone's speaker just isn't loud enough and you could miss a call or two if you don't have vibration turned on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5 (2016) uses an updated version of the Samsung Keyboard. It's quite comfortable, with a dedicated numbers row, a row above that for word suggestions and additional characters on each key (accessible via long-press).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If that seems too tall, you can scale the keyboard down (or up, if you want bigger keys). We don't like that the Space key is quite short, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional typing tools include swipe input, My Hot Keys (predefined phrases that can be typed by long-pressing a number key) and voice dictation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung continues to bundle the Microsoft app package that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Skype. Note that only Skype was actually installed, the rest are just shortcuts to Galaxy Apps (this way they don't take up space until you actually need and install them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Drive is pre-installed, however, the actual document editors are not (they are a free download, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-customized web browser features tabs, the ability to save web pages and enhanced privacy control. It's gets the job done, but if you want synchronization across devices, Chrome or Firefox are a better bet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Health is on board though without the advanced sensors (heart rate, blood oxygen) its functionality is more limited. It can still track walking/running/cycling and you can manually input water and coffee intake and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is the default file browser. It features Google Drive integration. You can ZIP folders to make them easier to share as a single file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Galaxy Apps, Samsung's own app store. Galaxy Essentials is a good place to find great tools (like Kids Mode), but for general app shopping, you would probably be better off with Google Play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz gallery orders photos by time, but you can switch to folder-based Album view. Sharing options include wireless printing, Android Beam and Wi-Fi Direct, but no DLNA (or other way to send an image to your TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several image editing tools are available - from basic cropping, to collage making, to a more capable editor (which supports image correction, effects and drawing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An additional option lets you pick several photos and stitch them into an animated GIF.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with advanced EQ features, FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5 (2016) features just the Google Play Music app. It gets the job done by allowing you to sync your music across devices and gives you some control over sound via an Equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player itself has a straightforward UI with most functions available as shortcuts on the Now Playing screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J5 (2016) also has an FM radio built in (something many Galaxy flagships do not). It can record radio broadcasts (though this may be disabled in some regions). There's no RDS though so the app won't show the name of the station.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is the only app that works in pop-up window, a feature dating back to the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get full subtitle support with advanced features to modify their appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app lets you play only the audio (if you just want to listen to a music video) and to play the audio via Bluetooth (if you have a BT-enabled speaker handy).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an "Editor" option too though that may be overstating it - it just lets you trim the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, there's no DLNA or another wireless method of sending the video to a bigger screen. No wired ways to do it either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is surprisingly loud, decently clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) went off to a great start in our audio test. When used with an active external amplifier its scores were as high as you?d expect and loudness was easily above average for an impressive performance for a mid-ranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in our standard headphones led to worsening of the stereo quality and added some intermodulation distortion. Volume levels remained high though and the other readings remained unchanged so the overall results were much better than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera department of the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) is virtually the same as its predecessor's. That would be a 13MP camera with a 28mm, f/1.9 sensor. In 4:3 aspect ratio, the camera shoots stills at 4128x3096 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The J5 (2016) offers Pro mode, but it's nothing like the one on the upper range models. It only gives you White balance, ISO and Exposure compensation. Essentially, the settings most phones have, but in a more accessible arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also sports the option to quick launch the camera with a double Home button press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no HDR option, which is somewhat disappointing and probably down to the dated hardware. The Galaxy J5 (2016) samples themselves aren't as good as we'd hope. We expected more detail from a 13MP shooter, but it seems to get lost in the processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, colors are good and contrast is excellent. There's a little noise, but nothing out of the normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also takes panorama shots, but they aren't impressive either. Stitching is okay when it comes to still objects, but once they get moving, all goes south. Colors and exposure are great, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has placed special focus on the front-facing camera. It rocks a 5MP sensor with f/1.9 aperture and is teamed up with an LED flash. Detail is good for a front-facer and colors are excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we've uploaded 13MP camera samples to our photo quality comparison tool for you to see how the Galaxy J5 (2016) fares against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p videos lack detail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded at 17Mbps at 30fps, while audio is recorded at an impressive 256Kbps, 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as quality goes, the video recording shares similar traits with the still camera. In spite of the nice colors and contrast, the detail is somewhat lacking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a short 1080p video (8s, 17.5MB) for download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also see how the Galaxy J5 (2016) fares against the competition in our video comparison tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) Key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Excellent build quality and good looking design</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display has perfect colors and is always legible; The lower than the previous model pixel density isn't a real issue</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Decent battery life, but video playback could be better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full software package; Too much storage is reserved for the system though</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snadpragon 410 chipset from previous year's model is a disappointment, but the phone runs rather smoothly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great multimedia app package with advanced music player, FM radio too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker isn't on par with a large part of the competition</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perfect audio quality if you have an external amp, but volume drops when you plug in headphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In sunny weather, the still image quality is good, but detail is lacking. Colors and contrast are excellent; Front-facing camera with LED delivers similar results; no HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality at 1080p is lacking detail, but retains the good colors and contrast from the still camera</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as the design is concerned the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) lays a solid foundation for the company's upcoming mid-range smartphones. There'll be few people to complain as the phone looks better than its price tag suggests and is rocking top-notch build quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, in terms of hardware the Galaxy J5 (2016) feels like a pretty minor update. The bigger screen and battery are always a good way to lure customers in, but the chipset is feeling decidedly dated at this point. And the camera certainly can't live up to the promises that its specs make.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running the latest available Android - Marshmallow 6.0 and having 2GB of RAM help keep things smooth, but we are left somewhat worried about things slowing down after longer usage. We'd say the Galaxy J5 (2016) polishes many of the rough edges of its predecessor, but simple refinement might not be enough to stay relevant in the fast developing mid-range market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see the Galaxy J5 (2016) faces tons of competition, including plenty of other nice-looking phones. Starting off, we have the Oppo F1, which for its cheaper price tag features a more modern Snapdragon 616 chipset with 3GB of RAM. The screen is a tad smaller at 5.0", but the cameras on that one are better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another Chinese contender is the Xiaomi Redmi 3. With a price tag lower than the Galaxy J5 (2016) it again delivers a Snapdragon 616 chipset, but with just 2GB of RAM. However, you get a lot more battery for your money at 4,100mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M5 is an all around better device with waterproofing, scratch-resistant glass and Helio X10 chipset. The battery is a tad smaller, but we're okay to overlook that when we take into consideration the phone's 1080p 5" display and 21MP snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei offers the P9lite, featuring its in-house made Kirin 650 chipset, which is way more powerful than the S410. The 5.2" 1080p display is a noticeable jump over the 720p screen of the Galaxy J5, and the 13MP camera with 27mm lens offers better shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Moto G (3gen) is a nice option, boasting IPX7 certification. Its Snapdragon 410 is similar to the Galaxy J5 (2016), but the almost vanilla Android experience might be the preferred option for many.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all we are pleased with the change in styling that the Galaxy J5 (2016) brings. The company has been refining the looks and build quality of its devices lately and it has been producing some pretty handsets across the board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, in the case of the Galaxy J5 (2016) that seems to come at too high a cost. A quick look around the competition is enough to convince you that the Galaxy J5 (2016) finds itself out of its league. With better screens, camera and chipsets easy to come by at this price point, the company will need to seriously consider a price cut if it is to give its smartphone a fighting chance.</paragraph>
