			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oh, look - it's another BlackBerry Bold! But what's the catch? And where is the difference really? Sure it looks a bit smaller than the 9900 but it's the same QWERTY / touchscreen combo. So far, so good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's play spot the difference. The Bold 9790 is powered by a different processor and HD video is one of the first things scrapped. To make amends, the phone has what's probably the best BlackBerry still camera to date. Both the screen size and resolution have taken a cut but we haven?t told you the best part yet. The Bold 9790 looks no worse than the Bold 9900 and costs less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the BlackBerry Bold 9790 is merely the next-in-rank. It doesn't have the premium features of the flagship but it makes sense as a potential replacement of the year-old Bold 9780. What it does is add touchscreen to a classic package, aiming to keep the BlackBerry experience up to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 9790 is part of the premium Bold line but comes across as more mindful of budget than your average high-end BlackBerry. It pretty much does the same job as the flagship but charges less and is not without charms of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Indonesian debut of the BlackBerry Bold 9790 reveals something about RIM's market strategy. It makes sense for the 9790 to stay out of the Bold 9900's way and focus on emerging markets instead. Not that Indonesia is technically one - it's one of RIM's strongholds. On the other hand, the Bold 9790 did need a strong start and a launch at a traditionally loyal market was supposed to give it just that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we're about to see what a smaller and friendlier - though less powerful - version of the flagship can offer. And to whom. Follow us on the next page where the Bold 9790 feels just as good as the 9900, if not better.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 comes with the standard set of accessories. The compact retail box fits a charger, a headset and a microUSB cable. No microSD card is provided. There's no leather case either - a nice accessory that the Bold 9780 could afford more than a year ago.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Bold 9790 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 is tangibly smaller than the Bold 9900 and that's more than welcome. Yes, users will have to make do with a smaller screen and keyboard, but it's not a thing to ruin the usability. OK, maybe you won?t get the same level of comfort as with the 9900, but the Bold 9790 is the compact class. It weighs 107g and stands at 110 x 60 x 11.4 mm. The important thing is the touchscreen / QWERTY combo works fine and the phone looks nice and feels solid.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 has the same layout of controls and keyboard design as its bigger 9900 sibling. The handset is comfortable to hold and the finish is very pleasant. The Bold 9790 does just fine without the metal accents and fiberglass of the flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, there're no glossy bits anywhere on the phone's body except - inevitably - the screen glass which transitions into a huge Lock button at the top. The chrome frame does come across as a bit cheap but the rest is simple and practical. We especially liked the rubbery finish of the rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of layout, it's the traditional messenger design. The front is almost equally split between the 2.45" touchscreen and the keys. The difference to the Bold 9900 is that this time around all four controls around the trackpad are stand-alone instead of sharing a single piece of plastic. This is probably not as elegant but individual keys are a lot more tactile and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.45" touchscreen has HVGA resolution, down from VGA in the premium Bold 9900. Effectively, it's a pixel density of a little less than 250ppi. The images are reasonably crisp, and the screen looks vibrant and punchy. The sunlight legibility is as good as on the Bold 9900 and we don?t mind the viewing angles either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the BlackBerry Bold 9790 stacks up against similar devices in our traditional screen brightness test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece, along with a status LED. Right next to it hide proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard of the 9790 has the traditional Bold style of sculpted keys, with metal ridges separating rows, exactly like in the Bold 9900. You can enjoy great tactility even though the keyboard is crammed in a little less space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many of the keys (not just the numbers) can be assigned speed dial. There is a dedicated currency symbol key and the usual command shortcuts: * locks the keypad and screen while # toggles Silent mode on/off. Numbers share keys with some of the letters and you need to press the alt key to use them at times. The good thing is that whenever the context allows it, the switch is automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is just below the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual set of BlackBerry controls are between the keyboard and the screen, either side of the trademark touchpad. The Call, Menu and Back keys are separate buttons with rounded edges and excellent press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset features the 3.5mm audio jack. It's exactly the same layout as in the Bold 9900, though an audio jack usually makes more sense at the top or bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the BlackBerry Bold 9790 brings no surprises - there we find the volume controls and the single convenience key set by default to start the camera and serve as a shutter key. An important difference for those coming from the Bold 9780, is that the shutter key is not a two-step button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the auto-focus camera being a key feature of the Bold 9790 - something for it to wave in the face of the flagship - it's a shame RIM didn?t bother put a proper shutter key. They must've thought the traditional continuous auto-focus is enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a very small pause/mute button between the volume Up and Down keys. The volume rocker and the camera key are slim pips of black rubber - a bit tricky to press but very easy to locate by touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Bold 9790 as we already mentioned is an extension of the glass covering the screen. There you'll find the single Lock key. This is the familiar invisible key design but it didn't quite work as planned this time around. The Lock key is really hard to press to a point where it becomes a real nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5 megapixel auto-focus camera lens and a LED flash are the most notable features at the back. They are placed on a black plate made of matte plastic. The loudspeaker grille is squeezed between the said plate and the chrome frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is all plastic, with a soft, rubbery feel to it, which is practically immune to fingerprints. It is easily opened with a slide. The price for this comfort is imperfect fit, resulting in a minor but irritating wobble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1230 mAh Li-Po battery is quoted at up to 408 hours of stand-by or 5 hours and 20 minutes of talk time. In our battery test the Bold 9790 achieved a score of the average rate of 35 hours in our battery test. This means that if you use your device for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day, you will have to recharge it every 35 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Bold 9790 battery scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD slot is under the battery cover, but is still hot-swappable. There is a small flap made of blue rubber, which you need to lift to access the card slot. It keeps the memory card in place after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 is the usual solid job, although you're not supposed to get a fancy design and unique finish. It feels solid in the hand, with great grip and good ergonomics. It's the compact class of the premium Bold line and it seems to hit the right balance. The smaller, friendlier size of the Bold 9790 makes a lot of sense as an alternative to the flagship.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The BlackBerry OS is a familiar place to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new OS 7 is hardly breaking news, with four BlackBerry reviews behind us already. The BlackBerry Bold 9790 is basically the same package as the Bold Touch 9900. Well, the imaging seems to stand out?with an autofocus still camera for a change?but without HD video. The rest of the software features are a pretty close match, down to the NFC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are going to reexamine OS 7 again in detail, for a complete and comprehensive coverage of the phone and its features. There are sections containing reused text but that's inevitable given most of the interface is the same. And you can rest assured that all the BlackBerry Bold 9790 specifics are accounted for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our traditional video demo to warm you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 7 tries to look like the QNX-based (PlayBook's) Tablet OS. The UI icons have been updated to mimic those on the PlayBook, but the rest is pretty much the same - functionality changes are brought to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen consists of virtual buttons. Clicking the row allows you to quickly toggle the cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth radios, as well as quick access to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking on the loudspeaker icon at the bottom lets you change the currently active profile, while clicking the magnifying glass on the other side of the homescreen lets you start a universal search. BlackBerry OS 7 introduces voice search, too. There is a small virtual mic button next to the Search bar. Just tap on it, say something and click on done. We tried numerous commands and names and the Bold 9790 recognized them all. By the way, when you are on the homescreen you can initiate a search by just starting to type on your keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there are any missed events, such as SMS, email or missed calls, they can be quickly accessed by pressing the bar between the search and profile icons on the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that is the app tray, which consists of several tabs. You can easily hide that completely or pop up one, two or three rows of it with simple swipe gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of the app launcher tabs holds all icons. A sideways sweeping gesture changes the currently active tab. The alternatives to the All tab (which holds all your apps in one place) include, Favorite (manually added) and Frequent (auto generated).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also Media (which holds media-related apps) and Download (for the apps you have downloaded yourself) sections for even more ways of sorting your apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To navigate, there is a trackpad as well as a touchscreen. The trackpad features the usual sharp and precise control. One place where it makes a lot of sense is in listed submenus that pop up as you press the Menu key. Not that they are not thumbable - it's just that wrong presses are completely ruled out with the trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much everything you see is clickable in BlackBerry OS 7 and works the way it's supposed to. There are still small elements such as the homescreen Search and Profiles icons, which are easier to access via the trackpad rather than the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The important thing to note is that, unlike the flat iOS layout, the Bold 9790 has a menu button to access options that are not visible on the screen. You get used to that pretty quickly though, so in the end the Bold 9790 manages to keep both new and returning users happy. Trackpad and touchscreen complement each other in a natural way.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 may run on the latest edition of the OS, but its phonebook is the same as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities get displayed when checking out their profiles. You can easily search for a specific contact by typing in a part of the name so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Bold 9790 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact gives you the available fields organized in several sub-groups. You can also replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily so it?s all cool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has both voice and smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 in-call performance was as good as we?ve come to expect from the Canadians. No voice drops or reception issues were experienced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What gives the Bold 9790 some extra points however is the Smart dial feature. Indeed that was our preferred way of locating contacts on the handset - you just press a few keys straight from the homescreen and a list of names that contain them appears on the screen. There?s no unpleasant delay or anything like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then select them with the trackpad or tap directly on the contact to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Dial is also available via the Universal Voice Search. It works like a charm too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 scored a Below Average mark in our traditional loudspeaker test; you can tell it is among the quieter phones we?ve tested. This is an unusual result ? especially for a BlackBerry.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging runs on BIS subscription only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 handles all kinds of messages through its nicely organized apps. You get SMS, MMS and email support out of the box and there are also a few IM apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, much like with the other BlackBerry handsets, a BIS account is a must if you want to use email on the Bold 9790. And while we understand the advantages of the BlackBerry internet service, it would have been nice to give users some kind of alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn?t forget that not every carrier worldwide is offering BIS, which reduces the Bold 9790's reach. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned itself a good reputation over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted from the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editor, which looks identical for all types of messages, is pretty simple to use and packs a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. That one turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and the smart-dialing kicks in, giving you a list of contacts containing the typed letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that combined with the comfy keyboard makes the Bold 9790 pretty great at the task it was meant to perform: entering text. Some added visual effects would be welcome, but getting the job done is what really matters here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Old, but feature-rich music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In OS 7 RIM has refreshed the Music Player icons, but that?s really all they did. It?s still pretty conservatively styled, but most functionality is there, and has been since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s quick searching of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Creating custom playlists is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, but unfortunately, there's no indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last time we had a BlackBerry smartphone for an audio quality test, we were left quite disappointed with its performance, so we were hoping that the Bold 9790 will help bring things back to the right track. Unfortunately, the Bold 9790 did even worse, putting up arguably the worst performance we have seen in the past few months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the active external amplifier part of our test wasn't a particularly smooth ride for the Bold 9790. Normally, we are used to seeing great scores all over the field here, but with RIM's latest we were treated to extremely high stereo crosstalk, above average distortion levels and sub-optimal frequency response. Volume levels were pretty low, too, so there was very little for us to be happy about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things got only slightly worse when we plugged in a pair of headphones, but that's hardly any consolation. The main difference was the spike in total harmonic distortion and the volume levels which got even lower. Audiophiles should certainly pick another smartphone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good video player, understands DivX/XviD, lacks AC3 support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With so many better options out there, the Bold 9790 is hardly a device you will consider if watching videos is your priority. Still it does a great job, so you might want to add that to the features list when you go out shopping for a new phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape screen is a good start, while the video player itself isn?t bad either. Its styling might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are the usual playback controls when you hit a key or tap on the screen plus a dedicated fit/zoom to screen option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bold 9790 video player promises to support DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 and WMV videos up to 720p resolution. It did manage to play all of the DivX files we threw at it. WMV, MOV and MP4 files up to 720p were no problem either, but not all the XviD ones made it. Sometimes we had no audio due to the lack of AC3 codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, and is probably more than most BlackBerry-purchasing users will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is nothing impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery has no changes since the OS 6, so it should be familiar to all the BlackBerry users already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid mode or viewed as a standard list. There?s searching by name here too, but we don't generally remember the names of our camera snaps, so we won?t count that as an extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can only be browsed in landscape mode or you can manually rotate them. Unfortunately the Bold 9790 has no built-in accelerometer to provide automatic rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can skip to the next photo without returning to the gallery ? you just flick your finger over the trackpad or do a finger swipe on the screen and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Checking an image?s properties, going into zoom mode as well as starting a slide show are all a menu key click away. Setting one of your images as a homescreen wallpaper is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are zooming and panning. We would have preferred if the volume rocker could also be used for zooming, but the gallery is generally pretty good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The best BlackBerry camera to date<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 comes with a 5 megapixel camera which is still the highest resolution you can get from a RIM smartphone. This time though, the camera is an auto-focus one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comes with the same unattractive interface and a relatively low number of customizable settings. What?s even worse is that the bar at the bottom covers a part of the frame, making proper framing a really hard task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is also uncomfortable, considering that you do most of your shooting with the Bold 9790 in portrait mode. Still you can always use the trackpad or the dedicated virtual key on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geo-tagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight from the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Bold 9790. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Bold 9790 is excellent - there is plenty of resolved detail, lively and accurate colors, good contrast and no defects of any kind. Although the noise levels are quite high, they are still tolerable. Frankly this is the best image quality we've seen from a BlackBerry so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several samples so you can judge the image quality for yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the BlackBerry Bold 9790 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. As you can see, the Bold 9790 is an excellent performer in the 5 megapixel class, doing awesome in all three charts.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great VGA video recording, continuous auto-focus helps too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Bold 9790, despite the capable hardware, is limited up to VGA recording at 30 fps. The videos are stored into a 3GP container.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing we were really impressed with was the continuous auto-focus for the camcorder. It works the way we love it ? it refocuses only when needed instead of constantly re-focusing as you pan around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is great too ? the frame rate is steady and high, the resolved detail is probably the best we've seen from a VGA camcorder. The noise level is tolerable, the colors accurate and the contrast is fine too. We couldn?t possibly want more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a VGA video sample from the Bold 9790 camera. And here is another 30s long sample.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 is giving you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect from a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the quad-band 3G with 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA gives you the extra speed. The dual-band Wi-Fi is also nice addition with an easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Wi-Fi hotspot is also available. Bluetooth with A2DP support rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 is also equipped with a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the BlackBerry Desktop Software. It allows you to sync your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bold 9790 is also equipped with NFC capabilities, which allow you to connect it to other NFC-enabled devices and NFC accessories as well as read NFC tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you have the option to use your microSD memory card slot for file transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Bold 9790 is a nice improvement for the BB platform. It is comparably fast and responsive; supporting multi-touch zooming, text selection, text reflow, mouse cursor, etc. The only thing really missing is Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it does have its woes, we?ll give it that. Based on Apple?s WebKit engine and using a similar caching system as the iPhone, the new BB browser reacts surprisingly like the one on the iPhone 4. Unfortunately, its performance is not quite the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, both browsers cache the already rendered page thus they show users a texture, rather than a real page. This way you get great performance while panning or interacting with the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you zoom in, the browser is not ready with the new texture, so it simply zooms in the already rendered one, effectively upsizing it, which makes both the text and images look blurry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here?s where the difference in performance of the iPhone 4 and the BlackBerry Bold 9790 shows up. When you zoom in on a portion of text, on the BlackBerry, it takes a second or two to clear up the hazy cached image of the text, while on the iPhone 4 that?s an instantaneous action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you got speed in panning and scrolling, even in zooming because the texture is quick to refresh rather than to zoom on a heavy page, but you get little annoying refresh moments on zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that's something you won't see on a stock Android browser because the fonts there are rendered in real time. But the heavier the page is on Android, the longer the refresh time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, again unlike the stock Android browser, the text reflow works only once - when the text is out-zoomed and you double tap on it. The text reflow stops working when you zoom in even more or turn the phone in landscape mode. The iPhone 4 web browser works the same way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we won?t bore you to death with these little nitpickings. The BlackBerry Bold 9790 web browser is a fast and modern piece of software, it renders pages nicely almost like a desktop browser and it will always get the job done unless you?re reaching for some Flash content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to use the trackpad for navigation instead of the touchscreen, you'll get a virtual mouse cursor and automatic panning and scrolling when you reach the end of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow works like a charm, just tap twice on the text you want to zoom and reflow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except for the missing Flash support, the handset provides a solid browsing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business objectives, the Bold 9790 has superb time-management capabilities. Its organizer includes a decent set of applications and although some of them are hardly lookers, their usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customizable events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful, but sadly the device fails to provide them. Calendar entries can be forwarded and conference call information can be merged into the Calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with the full version of Quick Office pre-installed, allowing it to view all kind of documents (incl. PDF) and edit Word, Excel or PowerPoint files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity. Given the slot limitation though, getting an alternative alarm clock app from BlackBerry App World seems like the right thing to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold 9790 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the usual functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a Password Keeper app, Voice Recorder, Memos and Tasks app to store your passwords, voice memos, text memos and tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Bold 9790 comes preinstalled with Facebook and Twitter applications to help you in your social life. You also get the native Social Feeds app that gathers all of your Facebook and Twitter updates in one place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World is where the apps come from<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is RIM's application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or PayPal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Managing your apps can be done through your computer or directly from the device itself. There are enough categories and a search box to make searching easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest titles. In general there's hardly much to complain about the BlackBerry App world interface, it provides a pretty solid user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At just over 14500 apps, 3500 games and 12000 themes, the number of applications isn?t as impressive as in the App Store or the Android Market, and to make matters worse only a small fraction of the titles are actually free (though some of the paid apps offer free trials).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Maps requires BIS fuel too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Bold 9790 is equipped with a built-in GPS with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated, and the only navigation option you get is directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get directions you can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them in every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map at the expense of a few clicks. Map data has also been updated, including more cities than ever. We can still think of at least several apps with more detailed maps, but let's not get too picky here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The question on everyone's mind must be how the Bold 9790 will coexist with the Bold 9900. And they're not asking nicely either. People are fuming in the comments and most of them seem to see no point in having two so very similar handsets released fairly soon after one another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don?t pretend to know how RIM think, but we guess we can see some of their reasoning. Let's look at the facts. It's six months sharp between the release of both phones. Even more, if you acknowledge that the Bold 9790 is only now starting to be available on a broader scale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it means is the flagship's been paid due respect. The Bold 9900 enjoyed its well-deserved head start. It had its place in the spotlight as the carrier of the new BlackBerry OS 7, the first of the family to cross the 1GHz clock mark and the first to have a VGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bold 9790 has no firsts on its resume but it's not applying for the same jobs anyway. Maybe RIM needed something to play against the youthful HTC ChaCha? Or something that's closer to the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro's price range?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC ChaCha ? Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the Nokia E6 must've been on their list too. It's an excellent hardware package, complete with all the Bold Touch 9900 trimmings. Now available with Symbian Belle, it's a hard one to beat, especially considering that its price has long settled at a level that's nearly impossible for a premium BlackBerry to match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia E6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we've come to that after all. Price is the biggest thing the Bold 9790 has in its favor. It's the affordable option in the premium line. One that's not supposed to compete with the flagship but help RIM widen their demographic and get a foothold in emerging markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 9790 is a natural upgrade from the Bold 9780 but you can throw in a few Curves there as well for flavor. It should be a good option too for loyal RIM users who fancy a transition to touchscreen but think the Torch line is taking it too far.</paragraph>
