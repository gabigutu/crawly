			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 is something that should have happened a long time ago. This is not to say that the form factor was out of favor with Samsung. But it took a slew of CDMA messengers to finally see a QWERTY side-slider to land in Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android debuted on a full QWERTY phone, but messengers were never meant to be the dominant species. The Galaxy 551 is pragmatic enough to accept the fact and live with it. Samsung itself knows better than expect the market to embrace more QWERTY messengers the skill and size of the Motorola Milestone or the HTC Desire Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 does not look forward to making a big splash, It?s part of a broader effort of giving the Galaxy lineup some depth in the midrange. With Froyo and all-round connectivity the Samsung Galaxy 551 makes perfect sense in the segment of affordable smart messengers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 does well to stay out of the way of the heavyweight Droid messengers. But some of the omissions on its spec sheet are surprising. Given the QWERTY keyboard, a document editor would?ve made sense ? but the phone actually lacks a document viewer to begin with. Even Samsung?s traditionally solid codec support has been hit by cost-cutting. The bottom line obviously is that Froyo, Wi-Fi and a QWERTY keyboard is more than enough for the money you spend on the Galaxy 551.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Samsung Galaxy 551 comes with a clear purpose ? to boost the messaging capabilities in the Android mid-range. It?s an affordable smartphone facing lax competition ? sounds like the stuff that makes the sales meter tick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us on the next page where we take the Galaxy 551 out for a spin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung Galaxy 551<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 is an economy class smartphone and it would?ve been unrealistic to expect anything more than the standard set of accessories. There is a mandatory charger, a microUSB data cable and a one-piece 3.5mm headset. A 1GB microSD card is also supplied.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy 551 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 measures 111 x 55 x 15.2 mm. With a body entirely made of plastic, it?s hardly a surprise that the phone tips the scales at the featherlight 117 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most of the Android smartphones by Samsung, the Galaxy 551 is made entirely of plastic. There?s nothing too special about the glossy black finish and minimalist styling. The full QWERTY keyboard is the phone?s most prominent feature and we?re pleased with its design and usability. The form factor hasn?t added too much weight and the phone handles quite well. Everything is within comfortable reach on the 3.2? screen in single-handed use and, with the keyboard slid out, the phone is secure to hold and quick to type on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While unmistakably recognizable as Samsung, the Galaxy 551 makes no attempt to stand out aesthetically. In a way, the generic styling defies the smartphone credentials but that?s the case for many Samsung smartphones recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2" capacitive touchscreen display dominates the galaxy 551 front. It has the lowly WQVGA resolution, just like the Galaxy 3. The poor pixel density is unpleasantly evident on the 3.2? screen. It is usable, but doesn?t do the software justice and pixelisation is especially visible in text. The sunlight legibility is pretty poor ? on a bright sunny day the display gets washed out to a point it?s nearly impossible to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling is another area where you can see some display issues. Now this may as well be a software problem instead, but when you're scrolling any list on the Galaxy 551 screen, the text font becomes illegibly light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an example, don't mind the fact it's tripled, that's expected and it's really ok. The issue is that when scrolling your file list or contacts list, the text font gets lighter and you can barely make out the current item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One good thing we might say about the screen is it uses capacitive technology to respond to even the lightest of taps. The multi-touch pinch zooming is also available across the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is the earpiece in the middle and the proximity sensor to the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the typical Android controls. The Menu, Home and Back are all hardware buttons, very well sized and solid to press. A dedicated Search key is missing but there?s a dedicated homescreen widget instead. What?s more, upon a press-and-hold the Menu key allows keyboard shortcuts: Menu + s for Search, Menu + p for Settings, Menu + n for Notifications, to name a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone you get the volume rocker and a lanyard eyelet, while the power/lock key is symmetrically placed across on the right. There?s no dedicated camera shutter key though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone hosts the 3.5mm jack and the microUSB port. There?s a sliding lid over the data port while the audio jack is exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece and a tiny slit for lifting up the battery cover are at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear features only the 3.2-megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. The piano black battery cover becomes a fingerprint mess in no time. It?s really hard to clean and ? what?s worse ? the glossy surface provides a slippery grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery. The battery is officially quoted at up to 9 hours of talk time and up to 520 hours of stand-by time. The hot-swappable microSD card slot is on the side underneath the battery cover while the SIM compartment is beneath the battery itself. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 is compact and comfortable to use whether you are talking or typing on the QWERTY keyboard. The weight is right and the phone handles nicely. The side-sliding keyboard is nearly perfectly designed and the phone?s size and weight allow a steady hand-hold when typing. The slider feels firm, with smooth run ? you have to be very particular to notice a minor wobble in fully open position. The only thing we don?t like is the glossy plastic used on the rear ? not only does it look bad, it doesn?t allow a firm grip on the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A QWERTY keyboard we like a lot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 packs a four-row side-slide QWERTY keyboard using the same layout as the CorbyPRO. The actual keys are set within a frame of very sturdy plastic, which should to endure the frequent slider movement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing on the Galaxy 551 is comfortable: the rubber keys are well sized and nicely convex, and have a very distinct press. Numbers are accommodated on the top row instead of using a numpad layout. Don?t worry about the top row - it enjoys plenty of headroom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As in the CorbyPRO, the QWERTY keyboard has dedicated shortcuts to web and messaging. The Arrow keys, Backspace, Enter and OK buttons make sure the keyboard can actually be used full-time for navigating the Galaxy 551 menus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 runs on Android 2.2 Froyo and is one of the first Galaxy phones to have it out of the box. As usual the TouchWiz overlay (or launcher as it?s technically called) is most prominent. It improves both looks and usability and integrates excellently with Android Froyo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the user interface is almost identical to what Samsung have on their other Froyo smartphones, we have reused portions of the text from other reviews but you should rest assured that we?ve updated the text where necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters we've prepared a short video demo of the Galaxy 551:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates up to seven homescreen panes, which can be managed by hitting the edit option in the menu. You can add, remove and rearrange the panes as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the Android 2.2-running Galaxy 551 relies only on still wallpapers. We guess it lacks the power to display live wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the improved notification area is one of our favorites. Packing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sound toggles on top since Eclair it now adds an automatic rotation switch. These handy shortcuts can save you a whole load of digging in the Settings. The Galaxy S lineup features one more toggle ? the GPS one ? but due to the low-res screen it was left out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen has remained relatively unchanged though? Samsung chose the vanilla Android over the TouchWiz one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung home-baked widgets are still here and even new ones are added. Some of the widgets are preinstalled, while others are available for free from the Samsung Apps repository. Still there are so many of those available over at the Android market that custom widgets are hardly considered a selling point any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting change brought by Samsung for the Android 2.2-compatible version of their TouchWiz launcher is the built-in task manager. Complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently active apps, it saves you the need to install a task killer on your own (not that you?ll need it frequently).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in vanilla Android). List view is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap and hold on an icon brings you in Edit mode (you can also select it from the menu), where you can uninstall apps (only the ones that you installed) or re-arrange them on the grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some benchmarks of the Galaxy 551:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual TouchWiz phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As typical Android (Galaxy) smartphone, Samsung Galaxy 551 has a phonebook with massive functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory, SIM-stored and all Google contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place. You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen (courtesy of Samsung and the TouchWiz UI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 also packs the quick contacts feature, which pioneered on Android 2.1. It lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange, are supported. There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the New message interface. The side-sweep thing is part of the TouchWiz UI and works in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 caused us no trouble during calls. The reception was good and we didn?t experience any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works like a charm ? the implementation is the same as in every other recent Galaxy out there - it searches both contact numbers and names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy 551. It scored a Good mark. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Thrilling messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple - there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward, delete and lock as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 also sports a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the virtual text input options are concerned, the Galaxy 551 comes with the Samsung home-backed keyboard preinstalled. It?s actually much more comfortable (and accurate!) than the often criticized stock Android QWERTY. The virtual QWERTY keyboard is available only in portrait mode, in landscape you have to use the physical one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Swype input, but that?s not a problem as the hardware QWERTY is there to fill in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is also available and works quite good if you?re in a quieter environment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vanilla gallery, downsized images once again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 comes with the stock Froyo gallery, rather than a modified TouchWiz version. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (and again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Galaxy 551 multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also use double tap or even the +/- buttons. Unfortunately zooming in isn?t going to reveal much more detail (if any at all).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player on the Samsung Galaxy 551 can handle 3GP and MP4 video files. DivX/XviD support is missing, but at least we had no problems playing videos at up to WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos wouldn?t play, but those are overkill on a WQVGA display anyway. Luckily, you?re not limited to the Galaxy 551 display. Thanks to DLNA you can view photos and videos on compatible hardware ? like TVs or computers with the right software (the latest version of Windows Media player for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface itself is as simple and as it could possibly be ? there almost isn?t one. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 makes use of the TouchWiz music player. The interface consists of several tabs for the sorting options: current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove those you don?t need to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Samsung has enabled equalizer presets on the Galaxy 551 along with Samsung?s DNSe technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What?s even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the eye-candy Disc View from the Galaxy S lineup is not available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 6 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unspectacular audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 audio output is pretty good for the most part, but the high stereo crosstalk sends it directly in the below average category on overall performance. Strangely enough the stereo crosstalk is most pronounced when no headphones are attached to the Galaxy 551, unlike every other handset we have tested so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still if you are willing to let this drawback slip, you should know that the device does pretty well in the other parts of our test. The frequency response is good enough, while the noise levels and dynamic range are excellent. Some intermodulation distortion creeps in when you use headphones, but it's certainly nothing to worry about. And the Galaxy 551 is decently loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A good 3MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 is certainly no cameraphone with its 3MP snapper but it's rare enough auto focus on lower midrange smartphones. What's more it's got several more bells and whistles such as face and smile detection and geo-tagging too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is standard Samsung for the most part ? and that?s not a bad thing. It?s easily thumbable and offers readily accessible scene and shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 lacks a dedicated shutter key so you?ll have to use the virtual key. To activate face detection, you should switch to Smile shot mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is as good as you can expect from a 3MP camera. The contrast is nice as is the color rendering. The amount of captured detail is satisfactory and the noise levels are kept reasonable. Overall, you get some quite pleasant results, even in macro mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Samsung Galaxy 551 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 can record videos in QVGA resolution at 15fps. This falls into the barely usable category ? OK for MMS, but not much else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the video sample from the Samsung Galaxy 551.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 covers its connectivity bases alright ? worldwide ready quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 2.0 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy 551 offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Buetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo allows file transfers via Bluetooth, so there?s little else left to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 doesn?t pack much internal memory (160MB is downright low for app installation), but it comes with a 1GB microSD card and supports cards up to 32GB. Thanks to Android Froyo you can move individual apps to the SD card as long as the app supports it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy 551 hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No Flash for the web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device. It?s fast, problem-free and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 3 browser supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and multi-touch pinch-zooming. The browser also supports text reflow ? a moment after adjusting the zoom level, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is big enough to fit complex pages well, though the text isn?t as sharp at low zoom levels as it is on phones with higher resolution. Regardless, it?s still readable and panning and zooming are fast so the Galaxy 551 scores a good mark in web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the Galaxy 551 is running the Flash-capable Android Froyo, there is no Flash support in the web browser. The situation is quite similar with the LG?s Optimus One ? the phone?s processor isn?t capable of handling Flash content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 relies on the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash support. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but you have to live without them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The organizer misses document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app is descent and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. Voice recorder is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no document viewer pre-installed, but you can get one from the Android Market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung filled the Galaxy 551 with a few of their home-brewed applications and we really appreciate their work. Most of them are quite useful and can be updated via Samsung Apps ? the secondary app repository on your phone . Whenever Samsung updates some of the current apps or widgets, or releases new ones, you?ll find them here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo is self-explanatory and works only with text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing Holy Grail ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text and Go does almost the same job, but updates only your social network status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The popular Layar Reality browser is also pre-installed. It?s a search app enhanced by augmented reality. Your search results for various POIs ? gas stations, hotels, parking, restaurants, shops, etc ? are returned and displayed in an augmented reality environment using the handset?s GPS and camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All the apps are in the Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 is running the latest available version of Android, but has a WQVGA screen, giving you somewhat limited access to the Android Market (some apps won?t run on low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS relies on Google services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about four minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that Google Maps come preinstalled. Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation by Google Maps still has limited region availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After a number of CDMA QWERTY messengers deployed stateside, Samsung?s intentions are clear ? continue to serve an underserved niche. There?s nothing particularly exciting about the Galaxy 551 in terms of styling or features but Samsung?s first QWERTY messenger droid to work on European networks won?t suffer from lack of attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An affordable smart messenger will be a great option to consider for many current feature phone users. The Galaxy 551 opens the door to the exciting world of Android and you don?t have to wait to get Froyo. With a complete connectivity package (Wi-Fi N, HSPA, GPS) and a great QWERTY keyboard, it?s a whole new level of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the new territory is duly signposted: some are quick to frown at the TouchWiz user interface but it does help brand-loyal users feel at home. There are small but important novelties here - such as the new and improved task manager and upgraded notification area with rotation lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy 551 enjoys access to both the Android Market and the Samsung Apps repository. The WQVGA screen resolution won?t let you fully tap the Market?s potential, but the handset wasn?t meant to be the ultimate multimedia device in the first place. On the other hand, Samsung will surely offer some free apps and updates through its own service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the Galaxy 551 costs about 230 euro, which certainly is a competitive launch price. The competition is there but we guess that Froyo will make the difference where necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s look at the rivals in ascending order. One of the cheapest Android messengers to find is the LG GW620. It?s a nicely built smartphone with a good enough QWERTY keyboard but runs the already obsolete Android 1.5 Cupcake. If budget is of utmost concern, you may have yourself a deal for about 160 euro.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro currently costs less than the Galaxy 551 too. The smallest of QWERTY messengers runs Android 2.1. It will easily match the Galaxy 551 performance and is more compact and personalized. Sounds good, doesn?t it?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Another couple of QWERTY Droids will offer bold design and a customized interface for about 200 euro. The Motorola BACKFLIP has a one of a kind reverse flip QWERTY keyboard, but runs the outdated Android 1.5. It only makes sense in the US where the Eclair 2.1 update is already available. The eccentric Moto FLIPOUT is running Android 2.1 Eclair ? it?s small in size but social and with an ear for music.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Motorola?s first Android phone ? the original MILESTONE ? is about to get its Froyo update. And it has been getting cheaper. It?s still a tempting package with a big and high-res screen, superior imaging, the complimentary 8GB memory card and metal on the body. The MILESTONE still sounds a great deal. Let?s just hope Motorola keep their promise and finally release that Froyo update.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro costs the same as the Galaxy 551, but old Symbian inside puts a big question mark on the whole thing. Solid imaging and media are something you can?t take away from it though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the Samsung Galaxy 551, it seems priced right and ready to take on a market where most of the competition is aging. It is not a phone to get excited about ? but you?d be wise to keep an eye on it. With the right kind of support from carriers, it might be a smart buy. Whether or not it?s your first smartphone buy.</paragraph>
