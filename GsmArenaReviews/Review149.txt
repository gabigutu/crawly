			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC came to the MWC with phones for the masses. The premium mid-ranger One X9 is joined by the fashion-minded trio of Desire phones. There are audio goodies galore too!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Based on the A9 design, the HTC One X9 has a metal unibody, but on a grander scale. Its 5.5" screen is flanked by stereo speakers and that's not the only advantage over the A9 - the One X9's 13MP camera has 4K video capture!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Read more about the HTC One X9 on Page 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the HTC Desire 825. It's the biggest of the three Desires (5.5" screen too) and all of them have a unique look. Literally! HTC micro-spray process paints the polycarbonate exterior with a unique pattern of paint specks on each unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 630 is the same except smaller (5" screen). Both phones have stereo speakers and come with a Hi-Res headset and certification. They have 5MP selfie cameras capable of 1080p video - HTC says people take a whole lot of selfies</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Read more about the HTC Desire 825 on Page 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 530 shares a body with the 630 but sits lower on the food chain. Still, all three Desires will launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. This one has the same 5MP selfie cam too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One X9 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The star of the HTC booth at MWC 2016 is the One X9. The successor to the HTC One A9 comes with a full metal body and the company touts it to feel like high-end silk. Well, we didn't feel like touching silk, but it did feel nice and solid in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X9 will be available in Carbon Gray, Opal Silver, Topaz Gold, Cooper Rose and all look gorgeous. It measures 8mm thick, but with a weight of 170 grams, you really feel the phone as a tank in your hand. The build quality is typical of an HTC high-end smartphone and we appreciate the company's crafstmanship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of specifications, the phone comes with a MediaTek Helio X10 chipset with a 64-bit octa-core CPU, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. It runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow smoothly and we were quite pleased with the 5.5" 1080p Super LCD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, the phone touts a 13MP auto-focus camera with OIS and f/2.0 aperture (folca length is 27.9mm). It can record 4K and offers Pro mode with manual controls and one-touch RAW enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is 3,000mAh and supports fast charging through a 5V/1.5A charger. HTC has made the One X9 compatible with the Dot View case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X9 will begin rolling out in North Asia, Europe, and the Middle East from the end of this month.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire 825 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire 825 is the largest of the bunch with a 5.5" display. Sadly, it packs just 720p resolution, but the screen itself is covered with Gorilla Glass for protection. The Super LCD looks bright, but with such low resolution on a large size display, crispiness isn't on the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't expect much oomph, either, as on the inside the Desire 825 has a rather dated Snapdragon 400 chipset with a quad-core 1.6GHz Cortex-A7 processor and 2GB of RAM. The phone runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with HTC Sense out of the box, and there are times, which the age of the chipset shows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it's not all dire, as the Desire 825 looks fresh and funky. It's made out of plastic and weighs 155 grams, making it feel solid in the hand. HTC's new color technology allows it to spray differently colored particles onto the body and safe for some color combos that aren't to our taste, the result is impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The funky details continue with the power/lock key, which is done in the accent color. The 13MP camera at the back portrays with a hump and has a f/2.2 aperture and 28mm focal length. It can record 1080p videos and has HDR and Panorama modes. At the front, there's a 5MP snapper that can also record 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the front, rather oddly HTC didn't allow us to take photos, but there are BoomSound speakers, which are Hi-Res audio certified and pack Dolby Audio technology. They do sound amazing, in spite of the noisy environment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire 630 and Desire 530 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 630 and Desire 530 share the same bold looks that we've come to expect from HTC mid-range smartphones. Their specifications are somewhat similar, too, but there are key differences as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones pack a 5.0" Super LCD screen of 720p resolution. The display is slightly sharper than the larger Desire 825, but not by much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Measuring 146.9 x 70.9 x 8.3mm, the two phones weigh in at 140 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones are quite different on the inside, though. The Desire 630 packs a Snapdragon 400 chipset with 2GB of RAM, while the Desire 530 has a Snapdragon 210 chip with 1.5GB of RAM. Internal storage on both is 16GB, expandable via microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the different hardware architectures, the two feel equally not eager to move through Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the pace of faster chipsets that many other midrange phones enjoy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other difference is at the back. While the two phones share the camera hump, behind it sits a 13MP snapper for the Desire 630 and an 8MP one for the Desire 530.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front cameras are the same 5MP unit, but only the Desire 630 can record 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be waiting for retail units to visit our office before we pass our final judgement of the phones. For now, we hope HTC spends a bit more time polishing the software experience to balance the aging Snapdragon 400 chipset in the Desire 630 and sluggish Snapdragon 210 chip in the Desire 530.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Vive hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sadly HTC skipped on the high-end announcements as far as mobiles are concerned (yes, the One M10 was a no-show) and instead went for a refresh of the Desire series. Still, the Taiwanese giant didn't quite disappoint in the innovation department, as it did finally out the consumer version of the Vive VR headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have ever dipped your foot in the emerging VR realm, chances are the Vive is far from new to you. It is a fact the cutting-edge headset has been in development in collaboration with Valve for quite some time. The good news is that the consumer version is now finally out and will start hitting shelves in early April, with preorders kicking off on February 29. That sounds great, but if HTC's gadget peeked your interest, you should also be prepared for quite an investment - $799 to be exact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If this all reminds you of some other VR headset, you are definitely right - the arguably more popular Oculus Rift went through a very similar life cycle - a long development road and an eagerly-anticipated release with an almost equally daunting $600 price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two gadgets are actually about the closest competitors currently out there in the VR realm. Both employ a built-in screen, along with a slew of other sensors for tracking, unlike Samsung's Gear VR or Google Cardboard which employ a phone display. However, it is worth noting that the Vive does offer a far richer package, now including a pair of updated wireless controllers, as well as external sensors, necessary for the room-scale motion tracking. $799 will get you all this, as well as two VR experiences (no, sadly not Half-Life 3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for actual changes to the headset over the Vive Pre edition introduced at CES 2016, HTC has promised quite a few, although mostly cosmetic. Sadly, the unit we got to play around with in Barcelona was still the Pre model. The actual changes include a refreshed headband, now minus the visible pack of cables, also a new software feature called Phone Services both designed to build a more user-acceptable feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone Services is a rather interesting concept that is somewhat related to augmented reality. The Vive experience might still have a few rough edges to iron out, but it is truly immersive with its isolating headsets, full room tracking and a pair of responsive controllers, now complete with haptic feedback. This can easily isolate you from the real world, which HTC has addressed by feeding your phone notifications and calendar event to the virtual screen and even allows you to read texts, send quick replies and take phone calls. And if that augmented experience isn't enough for you, there is always the built-in camera on the front, that can be utilized by developers even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also worth noting that just like with the Oculus Rift, you have to own a pretty powerful PC to power the experience. Suggested specs include:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the actual experience the HTC Vive delivers, just like with the Oculus Rift, the lack of content makes it a little hard to judge. It is a cool concept with a lot of potential, but, as expected, content and third party support could make or break them both. Currently, the Vive does seem to offer slightly superior specs(although things like the 2160 x 1200 OLED display and 110 degrees field of view are matched), which could very well justify the $799 price tag for many enthusiastic early adopters.</paragraph>
