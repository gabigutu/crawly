			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Honor made a last minute swipe at CES and blew us away with what its 200 dollar phone could offer: a metal body, a large 3000mAh battery, quick fingerprint unlock, and a 5.5" 1080p screen. Honor is also entering the US market with the launch of the Honor 5X, selling it as an unlocked and dual-SIM smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honor is a sub-brand of Huawei, but it is not a totally separate company seeing as the charger in the box says "HUAWEI" on it. Also, as seen on some of the built-in apps, "Huawei" and "Honor" are used almost interchangeably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor brand has grown quite fast and will grow even more with its US launch. As of now, Honor only sells the Honor 5X through Amazon, Newegg.com, and directly from Honor's own online store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honor has since focused on making mid-to-low end hardware for the low-cost markets. With this iteration of Honor's X Series, there is a fresh new design language and a reason for it. It wants to give you bang for your buck. The Honor 5X is targeted at the millennial demographic, younger adults who would like to individualize themselves while also making a statement (or maybe college students who can't afford an iPhone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this price, the lack of 5 GHz Wi-Fi and NFC are more than forgivable, though the lack of the latter would mean no Android Pay support. We can live with both, but we wish this device came with support for Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0. Some might wish it had a removable battery, that's one compromise you would have to accept.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Honor 5X currently does not have Marshmallow, the company has promised an update down the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the Honor 5X has a fingerprint scanner and a metal backside, features that other phones of this price range do not offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X comes in 3 colors: Silver, gold, and gray (not pictured). The gray unit is the only one that has a black front side which the metal backing is a few shades darker than the silver unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Honor 4X, its predecessor, the 5X comes with a bump in the display resolution from 720p to 1080p, increased internal storage of 16GB, a modest increase in processing and graphics power, and greatly improved hardware design that no longer looks generic and boring.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Honor 5X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X's packaging is nothing fancy, the phone comes in a matte teal box with Honor's logo in shiny recessed letters. Huawei's logo makes a cameo appearance on the back of the packaging saying "Powered by Huawei".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems like Huawei doesn't want there to be a complete disconnect between the two brands, but it wants the consumer to recognize both names almost interchangeably. We can assure you, this will not be the only time we see "Huawei" on or around this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting the device aside, we remain with a flat box with a SIM removal tool and some documentation. Underneath this is a Huawei branded AC adapter with 5V @ 1A output charger so charging speeds will be average. However, Honor's website has mentioned the 5X is compatible with a 2A charger as well. Below the charger is a standard micro-USB cable, both wrapped in heat-shrink plastic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned in the unboxing, the Honor 5X might catch you by surprise. Because you'd expect a $200 phone to be plastic-y and hollow, you don't expect the Honor 5X to feel as 'premium' as it does at 158g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the phone, like many phones, is not much to look at. It's quite plain actually. There are no logos or icons. The forehead of the phone has a standard speaker grille, a 5-megapixel camera, and the standard proximity and light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn the phone over to the backside and here we find the centerpiece surrounding the phone's surprisingly low price. The backside is actually made of metal, though, it's kind of hard to explain, but it feels like it's more "wrapped" in metal rather than actually made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're one of those people who like to carry a phone without a case, you will also want to carry a small cloth because you will likely never stop cleaning the fingerprints from the back of this device. We had to clean the device so many times to get it ready for our studio shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the character that brushed metal brings along. It makes it feel more modern and gives it a professional vibe. The other plus about most metal finishes is the variations in shades of different lighting. The color tends to morph anywhere from mirror to gray on our silver unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless, it still has that premium feel when holding it in your hand and it has a very attractive, finely and horizontally brushed aluminum texture that looks great when holding it up to light. The texture actually reminds us of any modern refrigerator with brushed stainless steel. Since this texture is so fine, it doesn't do much for the grip of the phone, nor does it resist any fingerprints, it does the exact opposite of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the top and bottom edges of the backside are strips of pit-textured plastic to allow various radio signals through. The upper plastic panel narrows into a small insert that trails toward the 13 Megapixel camera sensor. Just to the left of the sensor is a single LED flash. Just below the camera sensor is the fingerprint scanner whose placement is synonymous with many of Huawei's devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top edge of the 5X we find a single 3.5mm headphone jack and a noise-cancelling microphone, which doubles as a video recording mic for stereo audio. Turning it over the bottom side, you'll find two symmetrical grilles, the one on the right side is a speaker while the left side is a microphone for phone calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right edge of the device is home to the only physical buttons found on the device. The Honor 5X uses Huawei's button-layout which places the power button underneath the volume rocker. This is a bit awkward to get used to if you've never encountered it before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device houses no buttons but two SIM trays. The top one is for a microSIM while the lower one is a longer tray that's home to a nanoSIM and a microSD card. While it is still unusual to see a DualSIM setup in the US, it's a welcome option to have, especially for those who carry two phone numbers or for those traveling overseas.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a peculiar thing about the display like on other Huawei phones. A thin black frame runs around the display and when the screen is off, it gives the illusion that the bezels are super slim. It's really an effective trick that helps a lot in the aesthetics department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honor went with a 5.5 inch, LCD IPS display with a resolution of 1080x1920px.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also offers optional software level sunlight compensation. It would temporarily brighten up the detail in the dark parts of the screen content, which would otherwise be tough to see in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors don't shift when turning the device about, but there is some contrast shift when looking at the device at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color representation of the Honor 5X's display is quite good for a phone of this price range though its default wallpaper does not do the display any favors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, colors look vibrant without being too saturated, and the brightness is quite generous even in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While this display is generously bright in good light (473.1nits), it does not get as dim as some other devices can (6.1nits). This is not a deal-breaker, though, unless you plan on often using this device in pitch black rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the default display settings, the Honor 5X showed a very good contrast ratio of 1:1072.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The max color deviation (DeltaE) was 11.3 and the average one was 4.3. The whites were the most inaccurate with a slight bluish tinge but nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5X does let you manually change the color temperature of the display. When we played with it we were able to reduce the average and max deviations to DeltaE 2.3 and 5, respectively. There was minimal loss in screen brightness when adjusting the color temperature to a slightly warmer one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X features two SIM tray slots; one is a microSIM and the other a nanoSIM. It is capable of 42.2/11.5 Mbps on HSPA+ and LTE Cat4 @ 150/50 Mbps. The specs sheet lists the device as compatible with LTE band 12. Unfortunately, Honor has told us that it hasn't any plans to certify the Honor 5X for T-Mobile's 700MhZ band 12 at this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a couple of places in the connectivity department where Honor has found ways to cut cost. Among the common myriad of connectivity options like Bluetooth 4.1 A2DP and FM Radio, there is no NFC, also there is the omission of 5GHz dual Wi-Fi, which isn't horrible, but is often found on many smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't expect there to be any TV output via the microUSB port, though perhaps TV out options are becoming more and more phased out by mirroring devices like smart TVs, Miracast dongless, and the Chromecast. Of course, the case might differ in other regions around the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>EM UI offers many battery saving options that can help your phone sip battery to the very last drop. Right off the bat, as you begin using your device, the Honor 5X scopes out potential battery hogs and reports them to you via a notification. From here you can either ignore further alerts for that app, or you can force close the app immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter, for instance, are not protected by default, which means they get terminated upon putting the phone to sleep, all you have to do is head to the Protected Apps window and whitelist the apps that you expect push notifications from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a bit of a nuisance, alternatively, the apps could have been pre-protected so they work properly, or the apps could have been excluded from pre-installed apps so they'd be protected upon installation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also even an Ultra Power Save mode baked in which will disable all data, extra connectivity like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and only allow you to make and receive calls, send or receive SMS, or look through your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X comes with a generous 3000mAh battery which is just at the middle of what the 5.5 inch 1080p market offers with phones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, Meizu m2 note, and the Lenovo K4 Note. When looking at the overall scores of the devices in this niche, the Honor 5X did a bit better than most devices with an overall score of 76 hours - probably thanks to EM UI's excellent battery saving features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X did well for a device of its price. It gave us 9:16h of video playback, 10:00h of web browsing, 29:50h of call time. This battery draw, combined with the standby time, gives us an overall score of 76 hours, which is about how long the phone would last you if you used it for an hour of calling, web browsing and video watching per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary rating denotes the number of hours the phone will be operational if you are to make an hour of 3G talks, web browsing and video playback per day. Such usage pattern is of course entirely artificial, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>EM UI, also known as Emotion UI, is Huawei's own skin layered over Android. The Honor 5X comes with EM UI 3.1 layered over Android Lollipop 5.1.1. There is an abundance of features packed into EM UI, most useful while others being more gimmicky than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right off the bat, as soon as you unlock the device, you notice that there is no app drawer, there is no button that shows you a list of all your apps. Instead, they all show up on the homescreens just like on iOS. You can create folders and put away the icons you don't want to get in your way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though, organizing them might be easier than you think. You can organize your apps very similarly as you would with iOS, or you can create a folder by dragging one app icon onto another one. Once organized, the folder icons are grids rather than stock Android's stacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, one would worry about finding an app that's tucked away somewhere without a proper app drawer. You can intuitively flick down to bring up a search box. Typing a few letters will search through you apps, contacts, SMS, and even Twitter for any matching keywords.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you dislike EM UI's launcher, you can always use an aftermarket one that suits your preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When setting up a fingerprint for security, the phone turns off all lock screen notifications by default so you would need to re-enable them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, on the lock screen, is a quick toggle menu that can be accessed by swiping from the bottom edge that includes: music controls, shortcuts for voicemail, changing the wallpaper, settings, calculator, camera, and a toggle for the flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the fingerprint is easy and quick. Once set, a fingerprint can be assigned many functions other than just unlocking the device. You can assign a contact to a particular fingerprint which will unlock the phone and dial the contact upon scanning that finger. You can also use the fingerprint sensor to call the notification shade, the multitasking app switcher, or to answer a phone call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an Applock and a Vault baked into the UI, which will protect certain apps and gallery albums from opening until the correct fingerprint is provided.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are also available on the stock launcher; you can customize themes by changing the lock screen style, unlock animation, wallpapers, icons and font. Unfortunately, there is no apparent way to download more themes and the Honor 5X only comes with three themes pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be customized for every individual app in EM UI. You can choose whether apps appear on the lock screen, banners over the status bar, and in the status bar itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also some pretty nifty features baked into EM UI like a glove mode, sunlight enhancement, and one-handed UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the accessibility options are: Talkback, Switch access, high contrast text, power button ends the call, raise to ear to answer, color inversion, color correction, hearing options, and touch &amp; hold delay times.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 616 CPU with cores clocked at 1.5 GHz. The phone performs quite well for the price. It does lag every now and then, perhaps when loading a heavy game for the first time or opening a heavy app from a fresh boot like Facebook or Tumblr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once open, though, app switching is quick enough for the occasional juggle between more than five apps at once. Still. The Honor 5X could be quicker in everyday tasks. Turning off the animations helps the device think a little faster and work a little quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For GeekBench 3, the Honor 5X scored toward the upper middle range of midrange devices with 5.5 inch, 1080p displays. We threw the iPhone 6 Plus in here too, to make it a 5.5 inch display party. The reason the iPhone falls in these areas at all is because iOS' software is so well optimized, it doesn't need as powerful a CPU as Android phones need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 5 made the Honor 5X sweat a bit when competing with similar phones. It scored very close to the Moto X Play which has a similar CPU and GPU setup. While the Snapdragon 616 should outperform the 615, the Moto X Play was able to match the 616 in the 5X, likely due to Motorola's minimal skinning of Android.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seeing how the CPU and GPU work together for games, the Honor 5X scored near the Moto X Play again. With their similar setups, the Moto X Play, 5X, and Huawei Mate S all got within 0.5fps of each other.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time around, the Honor 5X scored dead in the middle of the pack. It scored the same 6.1fps like both the Moto X Play and the Lenovo K3 Note. The OnePlus One has the best performing graphics this time around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an all-around device, the Honor 5X did not get a great all-around score compared to the other devices in the bunch. The Honor 5X could perform better, but its software optimizations need to be on point in order to beat more of the other devices. Perhaps optimizations will come with the Marshmallow update.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X scored toward the middle of the bunch in the Basemark OS II 2.0 benchmark test. Again, the Moto X Play scored adjacent to the 5X, leaving both the Galaxy J7 and the Meizu m2 note in the dust.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening large apps or games might take a bit longer than you'd expect; however, once open, games and apps run fluidly with minor hiccups. Of course, heavier games will surely see dropped frames with the Honor 5X's Adreno 405.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even with the metal back plate, the Honor 5X tends to heat up a bit with occasional heavy usage or playing games for an extended period. Even downloading large files or apps can leave our palms feeling the warmth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls on the Honor 5X works much like any other Dual-SIM phone. You can call or text from either SIM, and you can choose which SIM is the default for data. The stock SMS app integrates the dual-SIM functionalities well and shows you which SIM is being used on which conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone calls are loud and clear thanks to an active noise cancelation mic located at the top of the device, next to the headphone jack. When put in speaker mode, the Honor 5X uses this top microphone as its main source of audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X's stock dialer app is a trinity of apps bundled together. These three apps are Messaging, Dialer, and Contacts, all of which can be accessed directly through the dialer via three tabs at the top of the window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing a number works just like on many Android dialers. You can dial a number, switch to the Contacts tab to search for a contact, or you can search for a contact using the number pad to input letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a contact is simple, and it's easy to switch between accounts to where the contact will be saved. You can associate the contact with a Gmail account, or you can save it to either SIM card which you have in the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The stock messaging app does not have too many customizable features. The text bubbles are solid green, and there is no way to change it. You'd be better off with a third-party SMS app seeing as there is no quick-reply option in this stock SMS app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker on the bottom of the phone is just loud enough for ringtones and notifications but does not have great dynamic range. Mid tones are heard best, however, higher and lower treble and bass sounds are just barely discernable. Nothing out of the ordinary for a phone of this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X scored "Average" in our loudspeaker test. It's just a touch louder than the iPhone 6s' loudspeaker test, though, nowhere near matched in audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This speaker is just loud enough for hearing phone calls; we don't think you'll be missing many calls with this phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Preinstalled apps and Storage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X comes with a considerable amount of preloaded applications. Thankfully these aren't sponsored apps or games, rather, they are either shortcuts to Honor's Huawei's online services or useful tools that are preloaded onto the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X has a Phone Manager built as an app which is like a second settings app with shortcuts to all kinds of utilities like battery saving, storage cleanup, blocked numbers and more. It feels a lot like a control panel or a hub.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pre-allocated Storage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before installing any applications, the Honor 5X offers about 9.6 GB of usable storage out of the 16GB internal memory so you might want to get a microSD card. Most of the apps cannot be moved to the microSD card, but some larger games like Asphalt 8 might have this ability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 5X's gallery app offers a Timeline view, which sorts your images by the date you've taken them. Alternatively, you can opt for the standard Album view with all of your images sorted in different albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The info icon up top gives some pretty detailed information about the image, including a histogram. Pulling down from anywhere on the screen lets you take a quick photo without leaving the gallery. The image comes out in a square 1:1 ratio at 3,104 x 3,104px.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements. You can adjust levels and add individual watermarks for time, location, weather, food and mood. They're gimmicky, but hey, nobody said you have to use them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to playing videos, the Honor 5X's default player is pretty basic. You can adjust the playback speed, and you can even pop the video out to use on top of other apps. Once popped out, it can be moved up and down, but it cannot be resized.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X comes with Huawei's custom music player app. It offers four playback modes - songs, artists, albums, folders. You can create your playlists, too. The background of the app changes dynamically to match the album art, which is a nice little touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard; it offers album art and lyrics. There are no equalizers to speak of, but the app does have a few extra features. It would try to pull album art, song info and lyrics automatically for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as the antenna. We were disappointed not to find RDS support, so you'll have to name your radio stations by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X showed perfect clarity in the first part of our audio quality test. When attached to an active external amplifier, the smartphone produced great scores top to bottom and things were pretty above average in terms of loudness too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Damage from plugging in our standard headphones was very reasonable too - volume dropped to only average, stereo crosstalk rose a bit but the rest of the readings remained very solid. A very good showing by the mid-ranger indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X features a 13MP camera with SmartImage 3.0 which promises to deliver the clearest image with every shot. F2.0 aperture, 28 mm wide angle lens with five elements, a blue glass infrared filter to help with low light shots, and a single LED flash. Photos are shot in a native 4:3 aspect ratio with a resolution of 4160 x 3120px.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camera app is straightforward if a little scattered. Swiping left or right in the virtual viewfinder lets you switch between still/video, and the all-important Light painting, Beauty and Time-lapse modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the shooting modes you can select HDR, and Watermark (also available post-shot from the image editor), among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front shooter has a 5MP camera with 4:3 aspect ratio as well which brings it to a total resolution of 2592 X 1944px. The front camera also has an F2.4 aperture, 22 mm wide angle lens with 4 elements, and a blue glass infrared filter to reportedly help with low light shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making out the different textures in Vidalia Park's plaque is very difficult because of the excessive digital noise in the image. This speckling is not only apparent in low light pictures, but in all photos we took with the Honor 5X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This noise blends the photos too much to where we could not differentiate obvious shifts in texture throughout an image. Branches of leafless trees were too soft to make out while dramatic contrasts like the edges of the park bench against the snow on the ground were exaggerated by the imaging software. It just doesn't look right in either case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors appear washed out in images with distant backgrounds. The camera was not able to accurately capture the warmer colors of the sunset going on above the waterfall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic range on the camera is not impressive. HDR mode is barely able to make a significant difference in the range of lighting conditions. While the camera was able to reduce a bit of the highlights to make out the skies, details of darker shades were left barely visible in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beauty mode is also present on the Honor 5X's camera. Beauty mode has a slider from 1 to 10 to allow you to refine how processed you want your face to look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama mode does work well and can blend different exposures of the same scene excellently. The Honor 5X does not use stock Android's method of stitching multiple photos together. Rather, it uses contextual software and "sweeps" the scene instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera is capable to up to 1080p at 30fps. In well-lit environments without fair ranges of light, the video performs fairly well like at a busy intersection. Though, we found the camera sensitive to objects moving toward the camera and causes the video to change in exposures as to compensate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, in environments where there may be more light behind the subject, the video camera (just like the photo mode) performs poorly in dynamic ranges of light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos filmed in lower light results in a noisy image and crunchy textures. If you are filming scenes with a lot of details like in our waterfall video, you'll be getting a lot of noise as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a video sample that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, you can also download full-resolution samples directly as well: Sample 1: waterfall ~25MB / Sample 2: intersection ~32MB</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Performance left us with mixed feelings - once loaded, apps and games perform well, but starting them up will leave you waiting sometimes;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker is average in loudness, certainly not high quality in sound</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excellent audio quality for a phone of this price range; Crosstalk was kept at a minimum and volume dropped just a bit when plugging headphones;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images taken with the Honor 5X are only okay if you don't zoom down to 100% view as image processing is of questionable quality;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos shot by the 5X are okay as well, though not stellar;</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X could be the best phone you could get for $200. At least in the US, as there aren't as many offerings in the mid-range 5.5-inch space. We like how Honor is pushing itself into the US market which is quite difficult to do especially in the mobile industry. From here we'd like to see both Honor and Huawei make a larger presence in the US to compete with the big guys in the US like Samsung, Apple, and LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X is a great choice for anyone's first smartphone, kid's phone, or even a spare phone. EM UI can provide a feature rich experience to users without overwhelming them with too many menus and widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honor's had to make a few compromises for this device, and they result in a very well-balanced trade-off for the price range. Lack of NFC, 5 GHz Wi-Fi, and an average performing Snapdragon 616 still don't turn our attention away from a metal-bodied $200 smartphone with a fingerprint scanner and great performing battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X could improve in the imaging department. The camera delivers "okay" photos, but we feel that with a software update to the camera, it could perform a little better in the way that it processes images. Still, camera performance is not bad for the price range of the Honor 5X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the added-value features of EM UI, the Honor 5X is among the best bang-for-buck smartphones in the newly explored US market and worldwide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m1 metal is priced similarly to the Honor 5X, and both devices are identical in screen size and camera resolution. They both have a microSD slot as well. The Honor 5X, however, gets you a better processor and more RAM, along with Honor's promise of an update to Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note is another phone that falls in the midrange, 5.5-inch/1080p device niche. While the Lenovo k3 note is a little bit cheaper, in return you will get a much better screen, but lesser battery life and an all-plastic build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J7 also has similar specs to the Honor 5X, though, it falls under a slightly higher price range. For a bit more money, the J7 will get you Samsung's TouchWiz take on Android, a much more refined camera experience, better battery life, but at the expense of having a lower screen resolution and an unremarkable design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sometimes it might be better to buy an older flagship for the price of today's midranger. And in most cases, the former outperforms the latter. In this case, we're referring to the OnePlus One. It's got better performing imaging, processor, graphics, and RAM. The only thing you'll be missing from the 5X is the fingerprint scanner, but of course, you'll also be getting faster Wi-Fi, NFC, and a much less intrusive Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's available in your country, the Moto X Play comes with many value-added features of the Moto branding while keeping the Android experience as close to stock as possible. It might be a bit pricier than the Honor 5X, but it delivers a snappier, stock Android experience with Motorola's legendary build quality, along with a strong battery endurance and an above average camera experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Intel chips in smartphones are still rare to see out in the smartphone market wilderness. However, the similarly spec'd Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML outperforms the Honor 5X, but it's also slightly more expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 5X offers flagship level features like a 1080p display, a 3000mAh battery, fingerprint scanner, and metal bodied-design in exchange for just a few shortcomings like the performance, lack of NFC and 5GHz Wi-Fi, and average camera performance. For $200, the Honor 5X is a steal, and the Chinese company has a large potential to pursue the midrange smartphone market in the US. The Honor 5X is a perfect example of ?No Nonsense? that the company has promised.</paragraph>
