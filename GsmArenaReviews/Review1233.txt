		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple gave the world the tablet. Samsung gave the world a choice. It?s not as simple of course as narrowing it down to an iPad vs. a Galaxy Tab. Nearly every phone maker out there has a tablet to offer. But the fact is that whatever size you want and whatever screen you like - Samsung most likely have it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have tablets stretching from 7 to 10.1 inches of screen diagonal. And these are either Super AMOLEDS or LCDs with the resolution ranging from WSVGA (600 x 1024) to well above HD. There are 3G and Wi-Fi enabled combos or Wi-Fi only versions. Users can choose between 16/32/64 GB of inbuilt storage. With all that variety on offer, it was obviously time to go back to where it all started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If anyone needed a refresh, it would be the original Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab. A single-core powered Froyo-running tablet has little left to offer and the 7.0 Plus does well to send it into retirement. The slimmer and lighter upgrade more than doubles the processing power and runs the latest tablet-tailored version of Android, Honeycomb 3.2. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is one of the two tablets of the house (along with the Galaxy Tab 7.7) to use Samsung's very own Exynos chipset - a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor and Mali-400MP graphics. As you are about to see, this SoC does quite well in the benchmarks, beating the NVIDIA Tegra2 competitors on almost every count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>7" is the compact class in tablets and you can reasonably expect it to be targeting the budget-conscious. With that in mind, we guess we cannot hold it against the Samsung P6200 Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus that it sticks with the screen resolution of its predecessor. It's worth noting though that the 7.0 Plus has the improved PLS variety of TFT displays. What's more, the main 7" competitors - HTC Flyer, BlackBerry Playbook - have the same WSVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, Samsung seem to have a superior alternative in the Galaxy Tab 7.7. It's powered by the same Exynos chipset - clocked higher - but boasts a WXGA Super AMOLED screen in a gorgeously slim body. All that beauty costs a small fortune though and gives the seven-inch Samsung tablet a space to fill as the affordable option in the tablet line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's still a whole review to go before we can call the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus value for money. Let?s get busy then, shall we? The hardware inspection starts right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus brings no surprises. The box holds the device itself, along with a USB cable, a two-piece charger and a set of earphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus gets rid of the angular sides of its predecessor to get more than 2mm slimmer. Overall, it trades the solid, blocky feel of a BlackBerry Playbook with the pretty much uniform design of tapered edges closing around the front, as seen in the Apple iPads and the bigger Samsung tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its bigger siblings though - the Galaxy Tab 8.9 and the Galaxy Tab 10.1 - the 7.0 Plus is designed with portrait use in mind. The earpiece is on top where it belongs, while the charging port is on a short side, right under the Samsung logo. Of course, four-way screen rotation lets you use the tablet however you like, but portrait seems to be the default orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By comparison, the bigger Samsung tablets don't have a logo anywhere on the front. Another thing is the front camera - in the 7.0 plus it's in the top right corner, rather than being centrally placed on one of the long sides. Being in the corner, it can be used in both orientations ? portrait and landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In portrait position, the 3.5mm audio jack is on top just like in phones but this makes little sense in a tablet. You're not gonna put it in a pocket and listen to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get to the earpiece of course. Full support for telephony is nothing new on Samsung tablets but the 7.0 Plus can actually be used as a phone - and we don't mean speakerphone or headset use. You can hold it to your face and talk as if it were just another handset. Just make sure there's no one around to make laugh of you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All screen up front, the back of the Tab 7.0 Plus is made entirely of glossy plastic, but the white paintjob does well to hide smudges. Black screen bezel, white back and a silver frame running along the sides - the styling of the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is clean and simple. Tablets usually play it safe and don't get too carried away with the design. The Tab 7.0 Plus is good-looking but portability and comfortable hold are obviously its top priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is built around a 7.0? PLS LCD screen with a resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels. Although obviously not the best screen to find on a Samsung slate, you can expect reasonably good image quality. The 7.0 Plus cannot match the WXGA resolution of its bigger siblings or the Super AMOLED screen of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 but the main competition isn?t doing a lot better either. The Blackberry Playbook and the HTC Flyer offer the same size and display resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7.0 Plus has a rather bright display with colors and contrast looking good indoors. There's a dedicated picture mode setting that lets you boost or tone down the saturation and contrast. As far as the outdoor visibility is concerned, it's passable even if colors do get a bit washed out. There is no chance you lose sight of what's happening on the screen, so no worries there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus has no hardware controls at the front ? it doesn't need any with Honeycomb inside. That makes it easily distinct from the original, which has four capacitive controls below the screen. Here, all you get is the front camera and an earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary microphone used for stereo audio in camcorder mode. The other one is at the bottom and you are warned upon launch of the camcorder app against covering the microphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus looks much like an iPad. It uses a proprietary 30-pin connector for charging and connectivity. The two speakers are on either side of that port. Not quite the stereo speaker layout if you ask us - and no, the earpiece doesn't get involved in video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the USB host and HDMI TV-out require adapters to work and they are not part of the standard package. An SD card reader is another optional accessory, which you can purchase separately. Be warned that you'll need a power cable to use the HDMI TV-out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aesthetically, a single connectivity port is the preferred solution, but still we prefer the separate USB and HDMI ports because they use standard cables, which are easier to come across.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The long sides of the slate accommodate lots of stuff. On the left you can find the SIM compartment and microSD slot, both sealed with plastic lids. The right side features the Power/Lock button, the thin volume rocker and the infrared port. The latter is used by the preloaded Peel Smart Remote app to turn the tablet into a giant universal remote of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The journey ends at the white back of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus - we should note there's a model finished in black too. Anyway, the 3.15 megapixel camera comes with an LED flash, which will probably make better use as a torch than provide serious shooting assistance. Then again, nobody buys a tablet for its imaging capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is powered by a 4000 mAh Li-Ion battery. Along with the screen resolution, it's one of the things that remained unchanged since the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery of the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus achieved a score of the average rate of 63 hours in our battery test. This means that if you use your device for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day, you will have to recharge it every 63 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus battery scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is well built and feels strong but not heavy in hand. It's easy to handle and that's why people would go for a 7" tablet in the first place. The 7.0 Plus is a welcome upgrade over the original Samsung Galaxy Tab. The Honeycomb 3.2 software is a good enough motivation but the bump in processing power is not to be underestimated either. For one, the 7.0 Plus won?t feel out of depth around dual core competitors but Samsung's own Exynos SoC gives its media credentials a serious boost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen resolution is the lowest in the Samsung tablet lineup but on par with the main competitors. The phone capabilities are an obvious advantage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HoneyWiz, is it?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is running the latest Android build for tablets, Honeycomb 3.2. It is skinned with Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz UI like all the recent Samsung tablets. The TouchWiz additions are nice, but you shouldn't expect changes to run as deep as on the company's smartphones. These are just some custom touches that should help the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus stand out in the Honeycomb crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin here is a video demo of the user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Designed from the ground up for tablet use, the Honeycomb interface gets rid of the typical Android controls we've seen in smartphones. The navigation keys are in the bottom left corner of the homescreen: Back, Home and Task switcher (plus a screenshot key courtesy of TouchWiz). The search shortcut is in the top left, the app drawer in the top right and finally, but certainly not least importantly, the notification area with quick toggles in the lower right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The taskbar at the bottom is no longer static. A tap on the arrow flips it to its side to reveal eight shortcuts. Clicking on any of them opens a widget that you are free to move around the screen and it stays on top of everything until you close it or you open its full-screen app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the taskbar-docked shortcuts called mini-apps are proprietary Samsung stuff. They include the in-house task manager, phone and messaging widgets, world clock and the PenMemo app, as well as a calendar, calculator and a music player. Most of the functionality is overlapping anyway so you might not need to go there too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has the connectivity toggles that we?ve come to know from the smartphone edition of TouchWiz. They offer more functionality than the stock Honeycomb quick settings - including GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth controls - which saves you the extra effort of entering the extended settings menu. The rest of the toggles are Notifications, Sound, Auto-rotation and Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons it the bottom left corner also have a new addition. We don?t know how many people other than reviewers and developers will find the new screenshot button useful, but it doesn?t hurt having it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the other buttons has remained unchanged ? back, home and task switcher is what you get with stock Honeycomb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search shortcuts (voice and text) are in the top left corner of the homescreen, while the app launcher and homescreen edit buttons stay in the top right. In-betweenis the final change brought by Samsung ? the dots indicating the number of available homescreen panes and the current selection (and they are clickable for quick navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has seen no modifications at all, but there are plenty of preinstalled apps that cannot be found on other tablets ? Social Hub, Music hub, Pulse reader, AllShare, Polaris Office, Video player and My files. Some of the other apps like the music player and the calendar have been modified as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the traditional Android benchmarks on the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus (Exynos, dual-core Cortex-A9 1.2GHz, Mali-400MP GPU). Obviously, processing power is the last thing to worry about in this tablet. It can easily match, and even beat, most of the current crop of droid flagships (smartphones and tablets). You can rest assured you'll be getting all the performance you need. There are only two gadgets proven to outdo the Tab 7.0 Plus in some tests: Samsung's own Galaxy Nexus (TI OMAP 4460, dual-core Cortex-A9 1.2GHz, PowerVR SGX540 GPU, Android Ice Cream Sandwich) and the Galaxy Note (Exynos, dual-core Cortex-A9 1.4GHz, Mali-400MP GPU, Android Gingerbread). We should probably put the Galaxy Tab 7.7 in there too but not before we've seen and tested a market-ready unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is fairly straightforward on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger screen has allowed some modifications that reduce the needed clicks for some tasks and thus improve usability. Samsung also changed some plain Honeycomb icons with TouchWiz ones, but nothing beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field on the top right corner as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or deleting the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options - edit contact, import/export, join with another contact, send or print a namecard, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is done via a popup window, where you the available fields organized in groups, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a field that hasn?t existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom field names aren?t available at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing worth mentioning - for every contact you get two tabs - the standard Info one we already talked about and History. The latter shows all the latest activity with this contact (emails, messages, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has everything - does voice and video calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus had great in-call quality and reception. Wherever you use a headset or the embedded earpiece the sound is crisp and loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also available ? all you need to do is press the virtual button at the bottom at the top left corner of the homescreen and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter" or "text Dexter").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only disappointment came when we ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. The slate was well Below Average, suggesting that it would be smart to keep a close eye on it in noisier environments. You can find more about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging app layout is similar with the phonebook - on the left you get contacts, on the right are the conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically transformed into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two email clients<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus comes with two optimized email applications out of the box ? one for your Gmail and one to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single email the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and check mail manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s basically the same excellent treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few further optimizations permitted by the large screen and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Now this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won?t notice any big difference when handling short emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the keyboard is too big for you, there is a dedicated virtual key on its top left, which will shrink it a bit. The keys become smaller and thinner, giving you even more working space. It's still comfy enough to type and we actually like this design better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s auto correction and auto capitalization available and you can enable sounds on key presses. There?s haptic feedback too - the slate vibrates exactly where you've tapped.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sweet Honeycomb gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of functionality, but it has too been tweaked to feel more comfortable on the large screen. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper right corner holds the sorting options, shortcuts to the camera, image details or extra settings (like make available offline for Picasa albums).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are browsing a specific album/date/location/tag the shortcuts change a bit ? the extra settings shortcut is replaced by a button that starts a slide show. The icon in the very top left corner becomes active and clicking it brings you back to the full gallery view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus gallery shows the images in full resolution so you can see the finest available detail in your images. If you want to zoom precisely to 100% just use the double tap gesture. If you feel like it you can zoom in even further - up to 200%, though we can't quite see why you would need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more fancy way to zoom in and out, but we are not sure if it is quite handy. Just put your thumbs (any two fingers will do - it's just that it only feels natural with thumbs) on a picture and tilt the tablet up or down and the photo will start zooming in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer-based trick is available here too - in the default view, albums with more than one photo inside have a cool 3D shadow effect when you tilt the slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz-ed music interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have blessed the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus music player with the familiar TouchWiz custom interface, which we find more functional than the stock Android one, even if it lacks the cover-flow-like browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now sort your tracks by album, artist, song, genre, folders, composer or year. Playlists are here too and there are automatically generated most played and recently added lists. Naturally, there?s also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) the interface splits into three screens - the filters on the left, the album in the middle and the now playing track on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the song name brings you to a dedicated now playing screen where you have a repeat (one or all) and shuffle options as well as a setting to add the currently playing track to favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers are available too, along with various sound effects like concert hall, music clarity etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name along with the usual music shortcuts (something missing on the Honeycomb 3.1 version on the bigger Galaxy Tabs). There is also an option to shut down the music player directly from this menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The best video player up to date<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stock Android Honeycomb doesn?t have a dedicated video player app but Samsung always provides one of their own for the Galaxy Tabs and so it made its way to the Tab 7.0 Plus. Allowing for thumbnail, list and folder view modes, it?s a pretty functional application. There?s also searching so even if you fill that ample storage with short clips you should be able to find the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus supports DivX/XviD/MKV files out of the box. Performance with higher-res videos is great ? it played ALL videos up to 1080p (including) like a champ - smoothly and hassle-free. Subtitles are also available and there is rich encoding support. We really tries to find something the Tab 7.0 Plus won?t play, but without success. It seems Samsung has put support for every common audio and video codec making the Tab 7.0 Plus a real monster when it comes to video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few full-screen options too - normal, fill and stretch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output, but for the poor headphones stereo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung slates are traditionally doing well in our audio quality test and the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Galaxy Tab 7.0 gets amazing scores all over and if it wasn't for its low volume it would have been really perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the output is still impressively clean for the most part. As a matter of fact stereo crosstalk is the only affected reading, but sadly that one took too big a hit to let us call the Galaxy Tab 7.0 excellent. It's certainly good, but true audiophiles will find better places to spend their money.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3.15 megapixel camera and 720p video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A 3.15 megapixel main camera capable of doing 720p videos and a 2 megapixel front-facing snapper (with VGA video) is what you get with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. Given that tablets aren?t the most useful devices for taking snaps it?s probably as much as you are going to need anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, the two cameras are mostly there to provide the functionality needed for video-chatting and some augmented reality apps or games and the possibility to snap a label or two as a memory aid comes as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is an oversized version of what you find on the Galaxy S II with the available settings on the left and the shutter key and the video/stills switch on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go a few samples to show you the image quality of the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus camera. We found it to be pretty good for the 3 megapixel league ? low noise, plenty of fine detail, accurate colors and good balance between contrast and dynamic range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, the 3 megapixel camera on Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus does a splendid job, but that's understandable - you have much more room and processing power here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is not much different, really. There are fewer options available here, but the layout is basically the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos are top-notch with stereo audio recording, full of detail, low in noise and generally, nice and smooth. There?s plenty of information too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a 720p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is a match to most of the HD capable flagships and tablets and our video compare tools is here to prove it. Of course, there are a few 1080p capable camcorders using the same hardware so there is room for improvement. Once again we'd suspect that the more demanding Honeycomb was the reason why 1080p is absent here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is well equipped in terms of connectivity. There is proprietary 30-pin USB connector for computer connection, but there is no USB charging (though some users suggest the USB charging actually works, but due to the low USB power output, the Android OS is not indicating it as charging).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you get quad-band GSM radios plus 3G speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA. It is GPS equipped as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thereis a microSD card slot as well. The 16/32GB of internal storage helps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an adapter for that. Using one you can connect card readers, USB flash drives and other compatible devices to your tablet and access their contents through the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy a separate HDMI adapter and connect the tablet to your HDTV with a regular cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there is an integrated infrared port. It is used mainly for smart TV control via the dedicated Smart Remote app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A browser to like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. There is full Flash 11 support and tabbed browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser. The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field - typical Android - which scores another point for the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks and History have their own screen with a split-screen interface. In History you can check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There?s also a most visited and today tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn?t need any extra software ? you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also auto-complete for forms and passwords.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though so you have to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for the Flash performance ? the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus does great at 360p, 480p and 720p videos right in the browser. Flash games go well too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, if you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause stutter when panning, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off all together).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A good set of organizer apps are available on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus, including the Polaris Office that can both view and edit documents. It has really nice user interface with 3D arcs for the recent docs, internal file browser, intuitive interface, etc. It supports both internal and web storage (via Box.net).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing and editing all kind of doc, sheet and presentation is hassle-free. You can also read PDF files, but naturally you can't edit them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you think of organizer features on a smartphone (or tablet) the first app that comes to mind is the calendar. It has five different types of view: daily, weekly and monthly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is optimized for big-screen use and is pretty intuitive. You can naturally set as many alarms as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock app is full of eye-candy. You get an animated globe where you can pick time zones or cities, there are country flags, day and night animations, etc. Once you try it, you'll definitely like it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are a few apps provided by Samsung for the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus worth mentioning - eBook, Memo, My files, Pen memo and Photo editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eBook reader comes with one book for free - The Marvelous Land of Oz. naturally you can add books stores, buy books from them and they will appear on your virtual shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eBook reader is quite capable - it allows you to highlight or underline text, change the font size and page color, search the book and put bookmarks. There is even text-to-speech feature with settings for speed and pitch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo is pretty simple notes application with interesting interface - you get your notes as sticky note on a wooden board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Files is a familiar app - it's the Samsung powerful file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pen memo does almost the same as the memos, but in addition to the text it allows you to draw pictures and offers some extra option as colors, background, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Photo Editor offers some basic picture edition tools - selections, rotate, resize, crop, color effects and adjustments, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last app worth mentioning is Peel Smart Remote. It uses the infrared port on your Tab 7.0 Plus to control your TV-set. Outside the USA, it acts just as a regular remote control and is rather useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are a US resident though and you are using a TV/cable operator, then you can setup your Tab 7.0 Plus to control not only your TV, but your DVR, DVD/Blu-ray players, streaming players, home theater system, etc. You also get full TV program guide, you can create watch lists and the app will take you to the shows you want to watch right now, no need to switch the programs manually to find them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Social Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) shows all incoming messages as one list and your social feeds as another. You also get handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the two-column interface you can easily switch between your accounts, messages and feeds if you don't need all the stuff in one place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and limited navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn?t experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, any money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and way easier on your data plan and with the Navigation itself becoming available in more and more countries 3rd party SatNav apps are facing extinction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it?s available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn?t do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market ? there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and powerful graphics chip, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus can run every Android app designed for phones and slates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android market is the fastest growing app repository around (also the one with the most free apps and number of downloads), so you can be sure that you won?t be having a shortage of software to install on your Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. True, some apps aren?t designed to work on a WSVGA screen, but most scale well, so the only thing you have to worry about is finding enough time to enjoy all those apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recently, Google also redesigned the Android Market interface to make it easier for you to find the quality apps. There are now featured apps, editors? picks and staff-recommended apps in addition to the usual top free and top paid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top new paid and top new free lists are worth checking out too and you shouldn?t forget the trending apps. Naturally, there is a built-in search and categories for the different types of apps so you don?t get lost. Recommendations are also based on your location to make it even easier to spot a quality app in the new Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if by some reason, the soon-to-become number 1 app repository on the market isn?t enough for you, you might want to check out some of the alternatives. Amazon has set up its own appstore and so has Opera, plus a few more minor app stores here and there. Choice is one of the best parts of the open platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's own store called SamsungApps is also on board. There you can get a lot of free apps for your tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Seven-inch tablets may?ve been dead on arrival after all. We can think of at least a couple that match the description down to the body bag. In hindsight, we should?ve known better about the original Samsung Galaxy Tab. What we thought was the iPad honking its horn as it sped ahead, was actually a flatline beep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But well, that was then. A couple of software versions and scores of Droid slates later, it?s a different story altogether. And we may as well be looking at the best 7? tablet on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus upgrades the original seven-inch Samsung slate, which obviously doesn?t cope well with ageing. And although it doesn?t sound as a particularly thorough upgrade, it couldn?t have made a bigger difference. Honeycomb is a welcome replacement of Froyo and the dual core processor is a warning shot to the competition. It?s worth noting too that the new release is slimmer and lighter than the original. After all, people shopping for a seven-inch tablet obviously care about portability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the minus side, the 7.0 plus keeps the screen resolution and the battery backup of the original. The Galaxy Tab 7.7 for example manages to squeeze a 5100 mAh battery in a much slimmer body. But well, that S-AMOLED screens do take less space on top of being superior in almost every other way. As to the screen resolution, WSVGA (1024 x 600) seems to be the norm in the class and it?s fine for a 7-incher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung P6800 Galaxy Tab 7.7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the more prominent seven-inchers, the BlackBerry PlayBook has the same screen resolution as the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. A number of price cuts don?t seem to have done much good to a gadget that came to the market rather late and is yet still rough around the edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry PlayBook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer is another potential competitor. The single-core tablet is running Gingerbread and though we wouldn?t call it underpowered, it cannot quite match the capabilities of the Exynos chipset found in the 7.0 Plus. The Flyer tries to make up for that with the Scribe technology and the Sense customizations that run deeper than Honeycomb would allow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Flyer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of these two has support for phone calls and the BlackBerry Playbook even omits the memory card slot. The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus has a definite edge in terms of processing power and multimedia capabilities thanks to Samsung?s own Exynos chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the experience Samsung offer is hard to beat. The rich software package, the impressive video codec support, the ability to make phone calls and the expandable memory are sure to be much appreciated. These features are by no means exclusive to Samsung. Phone calls are enabled on the ZTE V9+. The HTC Flyer and the Acer Iconia Tab A101 have microSD card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  ZTE V9+ ? Acer Iconia Tab A101</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire package is almost impossible to repeat though. Unless of course, you don?t mind paying extra. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 will gladly match the offer and top it with Super AMOLED and a slim metallic body. But that will cost you at least 100 euros more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, to wrap it all up, Samsung are leaving almost no blanks in their lineup. Their Galaxy Nexus and the Note fill a space where there should be nothing really. And they make themselves at home too. Then come the tablets ? and they do come in all sizes. The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is the entry level option. Alive and kicking.</paragraph>
