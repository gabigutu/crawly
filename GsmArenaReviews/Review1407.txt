			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 comes in as a reasonably priced and well-built smartphone with great all-round connectivity and a unique feature to set it apart from rivals. The ClearBlack display can actually give Nokia quite an edge if it lives up to the expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 has got a tall task on its hands. It comes to replace an iconic phone like the 5800 XpressMusic. The Nokia 5800 (despite all its imperfections) introduced Nokia to the touchscreen game with a winning move but now it?s time for it to bow out of the way with dignity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One bestseller out ? the next one in. The next generation is here and we?re happy to greet the Nokia C6-01. Let?s start with a quick check-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 seems better equipped indeed than most of its direct competitors. HVGA (320 x 480 pixels) seems to be the standard in this price range and nHD (360 x 640 pixels) trumps that and even keeps some deeper blacks in reserve. Not to mention stuff like HD video recording, USB On-the-go, DivX and XviD or Flash support, which are still rare enough to make a great selling point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed Symbian Anna - check out our impressions over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From where we stand there are some personality issues the C6-01 needs to tackle if it wants to keep the competition at a safe distance. The Symbian^3 shortcomings (no split-screen typing and a sub-par web browser) may not be make-or-break in the mid-range but they certainly matter. The other thing is the fixed focus imaging Nokia are so fond of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, this phone looks good and we really hope it delivers on the promises it makes. It?s not the top of the smartphone food chain and the C6-01 doesn?t feel particularly threatened. On the other hand, strong newcomers are always welcome in the midrange.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C6-01 unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 box is nothing out of the ordinary. All the basic accessories are included but there?s little in the way of extra features. You get a compact charger, a normal microUSB cable (not the short kind), a one-piece headset and of course some manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only bonus feature is a 2GB microSD card ? enough to get you started, but the C6-01 can take cards of up to 32GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 supports USB On-The-Go and you?d need a male microUSB to female USB convertor to use that. Unlike the N8 package, the C6-01 doesn?t have it in the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C6-01 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 103.8 x 52.5 x 13.9 mm, the Nokia C6-01 is a compact phone that fits snugly in your palm and is easy and comfortable to use in both single and two-hand scenarios. It is by no means a slim phone but you can?t really expect to shorten the C7 and keep the waistline. The C6-01 is the smallest Symbian^3 phone and if that?s not enough to set it apart, maybe the stainless steel rear cover and the ClearBlack display are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone weighs in at 131 g ? now, that?s more that you?d guess looking at it. Most of the load is obviously attributed to the stainless steel battery cover ? it?s perhaps the thickest piece of metal we?ve seen on a phone. The combination of compact body and solid weight works great ? the Nokia C6-01 looks hot and handles great.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Clear Black display is among the best in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 has a 3.2? AMOLED display of nHD resolution (360 x 640 pixels). What makes it exciting is the fact that this is the first screen featuring Nokia?s ClearBlack technology. The ClearBlack screens are touted to provide superior contrast and sunlight legibility by incorporating a layer that works similarly to a polarizing filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having seen it in person, we are pleased to confirm that a ClearBlack display is indeed worth the fuss. Surprisingly though, there seems to be more benefit indoors rather than outdoors. Part of the reason might be that the Nokia N97, N8 and C7 were already stellar performers in direct sunlight and it would?ve been very hard for the C6-01 to be noticeably better in this respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra-deep blacks are easy to spot and that?s what makes a real difference, even compared to the already pretty crisp AMOLED screen on the N8. In fact, the CBD unit can rival the SuperAMOLED depth of blacks and, as far as we?re concerned, this is impressive enough already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might frown at the resolution: the Samsung S8500 Wave offers WVGA on a similarly-sized screen. But the truth is it doesn?t make that much of a difference here. On larger screens, nHD might be inadequate but it more than makes sense on the C6-01. At 230 dpi it takes some serious pixel-peeping to find faults with the display. Besides, the large portion of its market rivals are stuck on HVGA (320 x 480 pixels) so the resolution is actually higher than average for the class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the C6-01 display is also pretty good, as usual for a capacitive unit. It?s not quite as over-done as the iPhone 4 or the Galaxy S screens, where sometimes hovering a finger is enough for a click to be registered. On the C6-01 you will actually have to touch the screen, which might be the better option for some users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, we are more than pleased with the Nokia C6-01 display. The ClearBlack technology is a real step forward, putting image quality on par with the best on the market and the touch-experience is great as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 is the touchscreen equivalent of the Nokia 6600 slide. Small but solid, friendly and reliable We?ve had no reason to complain about the looks of Symbian^3 smartphones so far. Both the N8 and the C7 are impressively built and good looking. But the Nokia C6-01 has the rare quality of being extra sharp and solid while in the same time kind and welcoming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time Nokia has bet on the balance between high quality plastics, metallic glossy frame and metal rear cover. The whole front is black with the only exception of the Menu key. The whole combinations works fine and the C6-01 looks alone are able to seal the deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the three hardware keys ? Menu, Answer and Ignore ? same as on the Nokia C7. All three controls are easy to hit with great tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece, the proximity and the ambient light sensors. Nokia C6-01 also features a secondary video-call camera on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side, the C6-01 has the volume rocker, the screen lock slider and the dedicated camera key. The volume rocker is quite small with almost no tactility. The lock slider (which is really stiff) and the camera key weren't much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is also stiff and requires extra effort for a full press (it's especially hard if you have big fingers). This might result in some camera shake blurring when shooting at a lower shutter speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and the left side are completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom we find the uncovered microUSB port and 3.5mm audio jack, the Nokia proprietary charger plug and the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 rear hosts the unprotected 8-megapixel camera lens, a dual-LED flash and the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum battery cover gets released by sliding and underneath is the 1050 mAh Li-Ion Nokia BL-5CT battery. It is quoted at 408 hours of stand-by and eleven and a half hours of talks in a 2G network, while connected on 3G it is supposed to last up to 272 hours of stand-by and four and a half hours of talking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>"Supposed to". We were terribly disappointed with the battery life on the Nokia C6-01. We ran two battery life tests both of them ended in just 24 hours with the battery completely drained.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test was pretty much real-world usage - 10 minutes talk time, 40 minutes of music playback (through the loudspealer), 10 photos, 30 minutes of web browsing (mixed Wi-Fi and 3G usage) and another 30 minutes of general tinkering. The Bluetooth was on for 8 hours (but not connected) and Gmail's Exchange ActiveSync account set to sync every 4 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We decided we pushed it too hard so we conducted another test - we spent 50 minutes talking on the phone, took 10 photos and left the Bluetooth on for 3 hours (again, not connected). ActiveSync was off too. Within 24 hours, the Nokia C6-01 ran out of juice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM compartment is under the battery, while the microSD card slot is on the right side. It?s hot-swappable as usual, you?ll just need to open the battery cover every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C6-01 is one of the best looking Nokia phones lately. It does stand out in the crowd of touch phones ? with unique styling and shape. Nokia designers manage to impress us lately, and they surely deserve credit for this one too. Beyond the pure esthetics, the excellent finish and durability are sure to be appreciated by most users. The phone was built to last, handling is great and the looks are top notch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian^3 doesn't bring many surprises<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 is the third Symbian^3-powered device we get to take a closer look at. We?ve been on and on about Nokia needing to catch up with Android and iOS. The new version of Symbian is certainly a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed Symbian Anna - check out our impressions of the new interface over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Finnish software engineers finally realized that it?s a streamlined interface that people want and got rid of the whole tap-to-select-another-tap-to-confirm nonsense that made Symbian^1 so inconsistent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 brings nothing new on the Symbian^3 scene and its UI features and looks are the same as Nokia N8 and C7. But we should do the tour again, because not everyone is interested in all the devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Symbian^3 is a definite improvement for Nokia but it?s obvious they couldn?t have gone for a complete overhaul like Microsoft. That would?ve meant losing a lot of functionality and is probably the reason why the Finns went the evolutionary, rather than the revolutionary way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo video of Symbian ^3 running on the Nokia C6-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian^3 brings both visual and functionality changes. The homescreen is the most evident of those, its size now expanded to three panes worth of space. You are free to fill it up with widgets and reshuffle them as you see fit. If three panes are too much for you, you can delete the ones you don?t need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might notice that the homescreen panes start scrolling only after you have completed your swipe across the screen but that?s how it was designed to be and not some lag. Some of the widgets are side-scrollable and the phone waits to see if you want to use them or skip to the next screen. Nokia has plans to fix that, as we?ve heard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you want immediate response you can scroll them by tapping the three dot symbol at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is unchanged, retaining the hierarchical folder structure. This comes in contrast to Android, and mostly iOS, where you get a flat menu structure with all icons located on scrollable screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now you are free to rearrange icons as you see fit so you might go for placing them all in the main folder and get a flat-ish menu system from Symbian^3 too. A list view mode is also available but that involves much more scrolling and that?s why we preferred to leave things in grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager has also been changed and now shows screenshots of the running apps, instead of just icons. You also need only a single click to kill them this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the Symbian has also been taken up a notch with the ^3 version. The Nokia C6-01 feels snappy most of the time, with lags noticeable only when dealing with heavy apps or when there are a lot of apps running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even though heavy multi-taskers will frown at the 256MB of RAM we didn?t get any ?Out of memory? errors even when the camera and the web browser with two active tabs were running in background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the poor text input solution of Symbian^1 has been left unchanged by Symbian^3 and that?s probably our biggest grudge against the new OS (along with the web browser but we?ll come to that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are talking about the virtual QWERTY, which takes you to a new screen to do your text input and gets you back when you?re done typing. That adds an extra step each time you need to do some typing. Not quite the simplicity we all want, is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have to point out that Symbian^3 is less inclined to skimp on the eye-candy as opposed to its predecessors. There are icons bumping and revolving, menus being opened with a zoom in and out effects and the occasional fading in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s again not quite up with the best, but considering that after some time too much effects become a nuisance we won?t be taking too many points away here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It?s a good phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 comes with a fully functional phonebook, which can easily be synced with your exchange account. Symbian has been offering users virtually unlimited phonebook capacity and excellent contact management for quite some time. The Symbian^3 phonebook has gone in the right direction with the social network integration too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting some of your contacts as favorites moves them to the top of the displayed list. This saves you quite a lot of scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign personal ringtones and videos to individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice touch when editing a contact?s details is the option to enter their address by locating it on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social network integration includes Facebook and Twitter, which should be fine for the vast majority of users. However you will need to go an extra step to check out your contact?s status and then another one to see their profile. We agree it might have created a mess if that was all added to the already lengthy phonebook profile but one of those extra steps is probably a bit too much. We hope of optimization on that part in the future software updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Expectedly we didn't experience any call-related issues with the Nokia C6-01. Reception is solid, voice quality good on both ends of a call. The earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available on the C6-01 and gets activated by pressing and holding the call key on the home screen. It is fully speaker-independent and as far as we can tell performs greatly, recognizing all the names we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In noisier environments though, its effectiveness might suffer. Bear in mind too, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the system will dial either the default number or the first in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is also here, practical as ever. You just punch in a few letters from the desired contact?s name and select it from the list that comes up to initiate a call. Searching by numbers doesn?t work though, but we think nobody will miss it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option for starting a call is via the Favorites widget on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C6-01 has the neat accelerometer-based feature that lets you mute the ringer by turning the phone face down. That same turn-to-mute trick also works for snoozing your alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically when you hold the phone next to your cheek during a call. It also keeps the screen off when it is in your pocket and you get an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 sat our traditional loudspeaker test. The phone did well there too. The Very Good mark it snatched means it should be loud enough for nearly every situation. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's as far as ringing goes. But the loudspeaker also comes into play when listening to music - and in that role, it impressed us quite a bit. The sound is great and the only negative thing we have to say about it is that it gets muffled when you place the Nokia C6-01 on its back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The messaging department still waits for a better keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed Symbian Anna - check out our impressions of the new, better keyboard over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 can easily cater for all your messaging needs, but chances are you will find the virtual keyboard rather annoying. It?s not so much the QWERTY keyboard itself, which is spacious and comfortable but the fact that it opens in a separate screen with a dedicated text box. There?s no multi-touch support here either so two-handed typing is likely to produce more thumbs than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that nuisance is not exclusive to the messaging department ? it?s the way the keyboards function throughout the UI. C?mon Nokia, is that hard to put a decent keyboard?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All your incoming messages arrive in a common inbox. If you like, you can also get them sorted as conversations, in threaded view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 relies on a shared editor for all the types of messages. Stuff like a character counter in SMS goes without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Insert some multimedia content the message is automatically transformed into an MMS. In that case, the character counter turns into a data counter showing kilobytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 email client allowed us to setup our Gmail account quite easily, while getting it to sync with an Exchange ActiveSync server took a couple of tries. In most cases though, all you need is to enter a username and a password and you will be good to go in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia C6-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be filtered by various criteria such as date, sender, subject, priority or even by attachments, searching is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. This can save you some data charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically everything you would normally need on a mobile device.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management and USB on-the-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike some competing platforms, Symbian handsets have always enjoyed a proper file manager. The File manager on board the C6-01 is a capable app that can basically do anything you can think of with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for a specific file or directory. All you need to remember is a part of the desired name and where it was located (phone memory or memory card), the Nokia C6-01 will find it in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With USB on-the-go enabled on the Nokia C6-01, you can also use the file manager to access USB flash drives and even other phones connected over the optional USB cable. Nokia C6-01 recognized all of the USB flash drives we tried but two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already find out non-Nokia handsets are not supported by the USB on-the-go service. But when you plug the other end of the USB cable in a Nokia phone, its memory card immediately pops up inside the C6-01 file manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery is not much of a looker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian^3 might have vastly improved the UI but the gallery was definitely not on the upgrade list. The Nokia C6-01 comes with virtually the same image browsing software as its predecessors and, honestly, it?s barely passable by modern standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, sweep gestures have been available for a while now and you are also getting pinch-zooming so it?s not all bad but some eye-candy would have been more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you?ve zoomed on an image however, there?s no kinetic scrolling and panning and that?s sure to cost the C6-01 a few points. On the positive side, opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the familiar pinch gesture you can also zoom in by double taping, the volume rocker or even the on-screen slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selection of multiple photos for deleting or sharing is available straight in the gallery. Unfortunately, sharing is only available via MMS, email or Bluetooth with no image sharing service integration. We guess that can be easily fixed by installing the necessary uploading profiles for the services you?re interested in. At least that?s how it works on non-touch Symbian smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features of the image gallery include the image tagging system for easier image sorting, the slide show and the albums system (again helping you sort your image database).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is relatively fast even with 8MP pics, but zooming is somewhat slow. You need to wait for a second or two every time you start zooming in on a photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album Cover Flow lands in Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian never had trouble with the music player features but its looks were far from impressive. With Symbian^3 however Nokia introduces a new Cover Flow-like interface, which adds the much needed eye-candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s automatic sorting by artist, album, genre and the option to create custom playlists straight on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the huge number of supported formats, equalizer presets and effects the feature set is complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case you can control it through the music player widget on the homescreen, which also displays the currently running track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of audio quality the Nokia C6-01 behaves just as good as the other two Symbian^3 handsets we have tested so far. Despite the lower price, the C6-01 isn't any worse than the N8 multimedia flagship, or the Cseries leader - the Nokia C7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When attached to an active external amplifier (i.e. your car stereo or your home audio system), the Nokia C6-01 performs greatly with no weak points whatsoever. All readings achieved in that part of our test were simply excellent and directly comparable to the best on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There wasn't much quality deterioration when we plugged in the headphones either. Sure, the stereo crosstalk got a bit worse (but still remained lower than on any of the previous two Symbian^3 handsets) and we recorded some intermodulation distortion, but for all purposes practical the output should be considered perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video playback on Symbian smartphones, the Nokia C6-01 is still among the lucky few to have DivX and XviD support out of the box. And it doesn?t stop there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playback was silky smooth on all files with a resolution up to and including 720p, which is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The media player app itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode but, since anything else would have made the widescreen display useless, this is understandable. In fullscreen mode, a tap on the screen shows the controls, which are otherwise hidden. The amply sized high-contrast screen is also more than welcome for truly enjoying your videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some restrictions do apply though. For one the handset cannot play any file that is larger than 2GB and you cannot fast forward and rewind ones larger than 1.5GB. If you manage to keep your files below that limit (which basically excludes full-length 720p HD movies) you will be fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other problem with the video player is the lack of any kind of subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Nokia C6-01 does extremely well on the video playback front but is certainly not perfect. Nokia should be able to address all those little shortcomings in some future software updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the Web TV section you'll find a handful of apps giving you access to the latest news as well as to movie trailers or even whole episodes of various TV shows. The apps here include YouTube, CNN Video, National Geographic, and Paramount Pictures' Movie Teasers applications. Of course, each of them requires internet connection (over 3G/3.5G or Wi-Fi) and note that not all content is free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia C6-01 has the same neat and simple interface as on its Symbian^1 predecessors. You can search skip preset and new stations alike with sweep gestures or you can use the virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C6-01 has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel, the C6-01 should hopefully be able to auto-tune to your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS info representation is the best part of C6-01 radio app. The radio station name gets displayed with cool effects across the whole screen, while the rest of the readings are printed in nicely legible font at the bottom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The fixed focus cripples all the 8 megapixels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. Unfortunately the C6-01 camera is also fixed-focus, just like the C7. Again, there?s a dual LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already know that high resolution and fixed-focus is a combo that doesn?t seem to make much sense. The produced images turned out as bad as we expected. On top of that, the camera interface is still far from user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only three shortcuts available in the viewfinder. Those allow you to toggle camcorder and still camera, set the flash and access the rest of the customizable settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have made much more sense if some of those settings were brought on the sides of the viewfinder too as it would have saved us a few clicks, but Nokia engineers didn't think so. Not to mention that the extra camera settings are the only part of the interface where you can still ?enjoy? the single-tap-double-tap routine that plagued the previous version of the Symbian touch interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the basic functionality is mostly there. On the C6-01 you?re in charge of white balance, color tone, exposure, ISO, contrast and sharpness. You can also go for one of the preset scene modes and there is an option for creating a custom scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection is also available on the Nokia C6-01. As for geo-tagging, it lets you record your current location in the EXIF information of the photos, using the built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the image quality, it turned out exactly what we?ve expected. The aggressive noise reduction smudges fine detail, but there is still plenty of noise. On top of that, there?s that greenish tint in the upper half of the images which somehow gradates into pink tint in the lower half. It?s most easily visible on the chart photos below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the major missing feature ? autofocus ? becomes apparent when you try taking a close-up shot. Anything closer than 50cm is a no-go and to give you a perspective, to fill the frame with a standard A4 sheet you need to get as close as 30cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact due to the strong noise reduction smaller text fonts are hardly legible even when the text is in focus, so making nice shots of documents and leaflets is a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Theoretically, the 8 megapixel sensor allows you to shoot from further way and then crop (or zoom in) to see the details you're interested in. You can't do that with a 3 megapixel fixed focus camera. But the heavy noise reduction on the C6-01 is harsh on the fine details (such as fine print) so it's still not up to the task.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is one of the first reviews in which we'll offer you the benefit of our latest Photo Compare Tool. You can see how the Nokia C6-01 image quality compares to that of some of the other handsets we have reviewed. Clicking any of the following three images will take you to our dedicated page for some pixel-peeping pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01 compared to Nokia C7 and Nokia N8</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good HD camcorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 shoots in 720p resolution at 25 fps and offers digital image stabilization. Clips are stored as MP4 files. Since the Nokia C7 did good with the camcorder we expected nothing more but the same. Fortunately the video quality is again a lot better than the image one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos shot with the Nokia C6-01 managed to impress us. The amount of resolved detail is good enough, colors look nice, noise levels are kept reasonably low. They are perhaps even better than those produced by the XPERIA X10 after it got its HD-touting 2.1 update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of the lower compression affects the file size ? 10 seconds of video take about 16 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video-recording capabilities of the C6-01 make up big time for the poor still imaging. Plus you get the smart digital zoom of the N8, which is actually pretty impressive for a handset in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video sample from the Nokia C6-01 ? 720p@25fps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 offers all kinds of network connectivity options - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSPA (10.2 Mbps HSDPA and 2.0 Mbps HSUPA). The GSM/EDGE networking comes in quad-band flavor and there are two different options for the 3G radio. The European C6-01 will come with quad-band 3G (900/1700/1900/2100 MHz), while the American and Asian version covers all the five bands available worldwide ? 850/900/1700/1900/2100MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB is version 2.0, with the standard microUSB port capable of charging the phones besides transferring data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already covered the USB on-the-go functionality, but just for the record, we had almost 100% success of connecting USB flash drives and other Nokia phones, but that?s about it. The Nokia C6-01 didn?t connect to card readers and phones by other makers. Unlike the N8, though, the C6-01 doesn?t come along with an USB on-the-go adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth connectivity is version 3.0 with stereo support and there's a WirelessN-enabled Wi-Fi radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot can be used for transferring data to and from your C6-01 and it?s hot-swappable. Also both the memory card and the internal memory are accessible when you connect the handset to a computer in Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the record, the Nokia C6-01 lacks the microHDMI port, found on the N8.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser needs lots of tweaking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Symbian^3 didn?t deliver the browser overhaul that the platform needs desperately. Despite the added multi-touch and FlashLite 4.0 support, the C6-01 can just watch helplessly as the Android Froyo speeds away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed Symbian Anna - check out our impressions of the new web browser over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the good things, the Nokia C6-01 browser has good page rendering and offers some nice features such as different font sizes (5 options), auto fill-in of web forms and a password manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash Lite 4.0 support is enough for playing Flash videos, but it?s not quite as impressive a performer as the desktop-grade Adobe Flash 10.1 for Android Froyo. You can also choose to switch Flash off to cut down on loading times and save some data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find-on-page feature enables keyword search. The visual history is a nice bonus that can help you find a page you've visited more easily. There's also a popup blocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser won?t let you open a new tab unless you hit a pop-up link. We'd have really preferred to see an option to open links in a new window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping on a chunk of text zooms it in on screen, but again, the text doesn't auto fit to the smaller viewport and you still need to scroll sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the worst parts of the C6-01 web browser is entering a web address, which can take up to four steps, while most competing platforms do it with one ? hell, some even do it with voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the Symbian^3 browser is hardly a better copy of its S60 predecessor and that?s certainly to the C6-01 detriment. Internet browsing has never been more popular and until Nokia did something about the usability of their browser, their smartphones will be getting quite a lot of stick for it. Sure, we?ve heard Nokia has plans to update it on all Symbian ^3 devices in the future. We?re yet to see how it goes then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now, if we could give you an advice here, we?d say get the latest Opera Mobile up and running on you C6-01 and use the default browser only when you need to access Flash content. The hassle of using two apps for the same purpose is still better than having to deal with the S^3 web browser shortcomings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian^1 used to have a pretty decent organizer already so all Nokia needed to do is tune it up a bit and slightly polish the touch experience. And that?s exactly what they did ? by taking the same streamlined approach as with the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are three types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has some specific fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 also allows you to browse office documents thanks to the preinstalled Quickoffice application. The Adobe PDF reader is also here to take care of those .PDF files, while the ZIP manager allows you to deal with digital archives on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the preinstalled Quickoffice version doesn?t support editing, but if you insist, you can get the paid upgrade and enable it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator application is very familiar but it lacks the functionality of some of its competitors. The square root is the most advanced function it handles and this is hardly an achievement. If all you do with it is split the bill at the bar though, you're more than good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a dictionary, voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The good unit converter we?ve come to know from Symbian^1 is strangely gone but you can grab one yourselves from the Ovi store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, set-off day and repeat pattern. As we already mentioned, thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traveler is a handful open platform application developed by Psiloc. It offers four services - weather, world clock, currencies, and world map.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian is still the best selling smartphone OS worldwide, but you won?t be able to tell that just by browsing the application stores of the different platforms. The Ovi store is way behind the Android Market, let alone the market-leading App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet there are signs recently that Nokia are realizing the importance of apps to modern smartphone users. The company has refreshed their Ovi store interface to make it more user-friendly and it is finally making some serious effort to attract more developers. With such a huge user-base, success is merely a matter of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are already a few thousand apps in the store and chances are that the most important apps will be there soon enough. Catching up with the best won?t be easy though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Ovi Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections ? Go Green, Tools for Professionals, Homescreen Apps, Highly Addictive Games and Web TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps record of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps comes with free lifetime navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 comes with a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a satellite lock from a cold start (A-GPS turned off) in just over two minutes. Keeping the lock from then on was not an issue for the C6-01 even in a dense urban environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably know since the start of the year Nokia made their Ovi Maps navigation free for all their smartphones, which naturally includes the C6-01. The voice guidance is currently available in over 70 countries and over 40 different languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia did a pretty decent job of the Ovi Maps application itself, blessing it with a cool, touch-friendly interface, as well as nice features such as the Lonely planet city guide, HRS hotels and the Michelin restaurant guide. There's also an Event guide that lists all that?s happening within a 3km range of your position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Ovi Maps 3.04 you get three different view modes including satellite and terrain maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand and can be used with preloaded maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Routes can be set to either fastest or shortest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 feature pack and capabilities are almost the same as the previous Symbian^3-powered C7. The thing that makes C6-01 special is its elegant and unique look plus it?s compact form factor. We guess the lower price will be a factor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time Nokia has bet on a smaller AMOLED screen in order to give us a more pocket friendly phone. Of course, shrinking the phone has made an impact on the thickness, but most users won?t have problems with that additional 3mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the time being Nokia C6-01 can be yours for around 300 euro, which is close to the price announced initially by Nokia. As things stand right now, the Nokia C6-01 is too close to C7. The only differences are in the slightly bigger screen and the FM transmitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a few more bucks you could get the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10, which has just got its long awaited update to Android 2.1 or the Motorola MILESTONE XT720, which runs Eclair as well. Both of them pack 8MP snappers with autofocus and 720p HD video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 ? Motorola MILESTONE XT720</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you?re into the Bada thing or want to bet on another relatively new OS, you should definitely check the two Waves. The Bada pioneer Samsung S8500 Wave offers 3.3-inches of Super AMOLED screen, Hummingbird processor and 5 megapixel camera with HD video recording. It costs 50 euro less than Nokia C6-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently unveiled Samsung S8530 Wave II should start selling later this month for about the same price as Nokia C6-01. It is also based on Samsung?s Bada (v1.2) platform but this time around, you get a 3.7? LCD display instead of a 3.3? Super AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung S8500 Wave ? Samsung S8530 Wave II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it happened with the Nokia C7, the C6-01 sees a real threat only within its own family. If you have decided on Symbian, then your choice is between C6-01, C7 or the seriously more expensive N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 is the company?s first smartphone for quite some time that has managed to impress us with its design. If you can forgive the uninspiring camera performance and the few Symbian faults, then C6-01 is a friendly little chap that deserves attention. The one thing we really hope is Nokia fix some of the things we noted throughout the review with the future firmware updates. That would make it a bestseller.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian Anna update<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian Anna debuted a while ago with the Nokia X7 and the E6 but the original quartet of new generation Nokia phones that initially launched with Symbian^3 now gets to join in on the fun as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put a Nokia N8 through the update process and fiddled with it - then we decided you might be interested in a quick Symbian^3 vs. Symbian Anna comparison. X7 and E6 owners might not, but if you have a Nokia N8, C7, C6-01 or E7 you should check this out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start off with how your phone to update to Anna. And while it's going through the process, you can read through the rest of this article to see what changes you can expect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting Symbian Anna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we start comparing Anna to its ^3 predecessor, we'll go over how to update to Anna first. If you've bought an X7 or an E6, you're all set, but those who have the Symbian^3 Nokias need to do this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that Anna is officially out, the simplest way to update is straight on the phone. Get to the Device updates screen (either from Settings or by entering *#0000# into the dialer). Hit Options and choose Check for updates. After the phone confirms there is new software available, hit accept and enjoy Anna after the update process finishes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another way is to use the SW update app, which can be set to check for new update automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is to use Ovi Suite. After connecting your phone, Ovi Suite will check for updates (you can do it manually too) and will show a notification on the top row of buttons. It's a good idea to do a backup of your phone before you start - you have Ovi Suite connected anyhow, best to be safe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're on a Mac, you have Nokia Software Updater at your disposal. It works just like Ovi Suite - connect the phone, app will check for updates and apply them if it finds any.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface changes - better text input, little else<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It may not be immediately apparent to the untrained eye just what exactly Anna does to the homescreen to give it a nudge in the direction of usability. But after using it for a bit, you start to notice things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a new video of the user interface - check out Anna running on the N8:.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new style icons might be the first thing that hits you - the simple, rounded icons are a god new look for Symbian - or it could be that scrolling the homescreen is much more tangible. You "push" the homescreen sideways and it moves, instead of the old homescreen that moved only after you've finished with your swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other things haven?t changed however - the hierarchical menu that is a throwback to a past era is still here. You can rearrange your icons, but the flat menu structure that iOS and Android have popularized is hard to achieve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager that only fits three apps at a time hasn?t changed either - landscape mode offers much more space but it still only fits three. If you're not in the habit of closing your apps, you'll have to do quite a bit of scrolling to switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one UI change that really makes Anna a must-have for Nokia owners is the new text input - lo and behold the split screen keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In previous versions of Symbian you had two options - go to a new screen to enter your text on a full-screen landscape QWERTY and then go back or use that tiny, movable QWERTY keyboard that was basically a pain in the butt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anna however enables the portrait QWERTY, which overlays the bottom half of the screen and lets you stay in the app and type simultaneously. Besides letting you enter text without flipping the phone to its side and without going back and forth in the UI, it enables more subtle changes - like autosuggestion in the web browser that actually works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the portrait QWERTY are a bit small, despite the available screen estate. Still, you can activate word prediction, which will fix the word you're trying to type and show a small popup with the word you actually typed, in case you're trying to enter something like a user name (which doesn?t have to be a valid word, in fact word prediction in this case gets in the way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape QWERTY keyboard is also available in split-screen mode and it offers bigger, easier to hit keys, making it the preferred option for entering long text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's not perfect - several apps would popup the old text edit screen, covering the app screen even though we were using the portrait QWERTY. The Ovi store app is an example of where that happens, which was a little disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while Symbian Anna isn't a huge change in the interface department, it does sand away some of the rough edges of Nokia's aging OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, some of the native apps also received an update, which improved the general functionality of the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Native Symbian apps were updated too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most noticeable change is in the web browser - it's a lot user friendlier now, with its proper URL bar (thanks split-screen QWERTY!), the always visible back button (vital for navigating web pages) and things like manually opening new tabs (before Anna the only way to open a new tab was to set a link open in a new tab).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are changes we've been expecting for ages and we cheered when Nokia put them in the X7 and E6. And now, Nokia's first wave of new Symbians can enjoy it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Anna is not Froyo - Flash is still pretty much no-go on Symbian, with only Flash Lite 4 supported. So, no watching YouTube videos in-browser or playing Flash games. And the new interface, as much as it improves on the old one, is still miles behind Mobile Safari and the Android browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another native Symbian app that got a major improvement is Nokia Maps, which went up to version 3.06. That's the version you get with the new OS update, but v3.06 is available for older Symbian versions and older phones too, so you'll only see a difference if you haven't updated Maps separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the new version brings a redesigned menu and improved search functionality. Also, public transport lines are available on the maps with the new version and you can download country maps directly on the phone (you no longer need a computer to do that). Social network check-ins are also part of the new package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of SNS skills, Anna adds a few niceties here too - you can check out the latest status updates by your friends in their contact cards in the phonebook, you can upload high-res images and add captions to them too. Retweeting has also been added as an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Store has been updated and can now download bigger apps over Wi-Fi but there are no visual changes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian hasn?t seen any groundbreaking changes in its recent history and Anna isn't one either - like the jump from ^1 to ^3, it's an incremental update that improves things but leaves some rough edges untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong - Anna is the best that Symbian has to offer right now (until Belle arrives anyway) and people with an N8, a C7, C6-01 or E7 should update as soon as possible - the browser alone is a good enough reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N8 owners have a special incentive too - with Anna installed, they can apply the camera update and enjoy 30fps videos with continuous autofocus (and a slightly better UI). Let's face it, people bought N8s chiefly for its camera, so Nokia continuing to improve it is commendable. We've covered that in another post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the number of things left that need changing is much longer than the list of things that have changed. On the other hand, after Nokia announced they'll be focusing on Windows Phone 7, we were worried about Symbian's future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turns out those worries were unfounded - with Anna out now and Belle just around the corner (and there are 1GHz Symbian devices out too), Symbian seems more alive now than it was a year ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a long way to go before it catches up to Android, but we'll be following it (and reviewing it) every step of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What are your impressions - is there still fight left in Symbian or are these updates just a stopgap measure while we're waiting for the Nokia-made WP7 phones to show up?</paragraph>
