			<paragraph>With Samsung C5212 Duos you get two phones in one. This is the latest Samsung handset to offer seamless dual SIM handling with almost no compromise in terms of usability and telephony. The C5212 Duos looks a good basic package of reserved yet solid looks and great build quality. Plus, it's going to be the most affordable dual SIM-enabled handset by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Armed with a basic 1.3 megapixel camera and a decent 2.2" display with a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels, the Samsung C5212 Duos is a budget handset that will do the job of two. You are welcome to join us as we explore its dualistic nature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung C5212 Duos at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C5212 Duos proves Samsung have a pretty good idea of what a true dual SIM phone should look and act like. Well, they don't seem to shy away from experimenting either, but the recent S9402 Ego (link) is just taking it too far. Our C5212 Duos here is nothing like that. Reserved and to the point, it's a faithful rehash of the original dual SIM bar D780.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, people over at Samsung must be resolute about owning the dual SIM market with quite a strong two-in-one lineup. The other dual SIM enabled handsets include Samsung D880 Duos, Samsung D980 and Samsung B5702.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phones accommodating two SIM cards are obviously a viable market niche. To name just a few reasons why one should be interested in a dual-SIM mobile we can mention using both a personal and a business number on a single handset, saving some money by combining two different plans or network carriers, or regularly using local prepaid cards on business trips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are about to explore what's quite possibly the most affordable dual SIM phone by a leading brand - Samsung C5212 Duos. But let's warm up first with a neat little 360-degree spin on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung C5212 Duos 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung C5212 Duos design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>C5212 Duos measures 112.7 x 48.6 x 14.3 mm and weighs 110 grams, which makes it a relatively compact device. After all, there are two GSM transceivers in there. A classic bar with subtly rounded edges, it is very comfortable to handle. Though this phone is targeted at the mass market, looks are not excruciatingly low-end. The C5212 Duos follows the Samsung D780 design quite closely, but is notably more compact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, the Samsung C5212 Duos we see for the first time looks so stunningly familiar. It is almost identical to Samsung L700, which is also positioned in the lower midrange Samsung portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C5212 Duos has a nice 2.2" TFT display of 176 x 220 pixel resolution. The screen estate is quite big for the pixel count, but the interface graphics come out so well we couldn't really tell the low resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the phone is a true joy to use. The large keys have excellent touch orientation and press feedback. All the controls around the D-pad are laid out quite well and the metallic accents are subtle but sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone accommodates the proprietary Samsung universal connectivity port, which is used for plugging the charger, data cable and headset. The neat and responsive volume rocker is positioned higher on the same side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of Samsung C5212 Duos hosts the shutter key and probably the most important control on this device: the nicely projecting and very responsive dual SIM management key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone over reveals the matt plastic battery cover and the camera lens with self-portrait mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C5212 Duos is powered by a 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery. That's a step down from the 1200 mAh battery of the D780 Duos and we have some concerns whether the C5212 Duos battery can keep the phone going for more than two days of intensive use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the dual SIM card bed and the obviously not hot-swappable microSD memory card. On a positive note, we tested the Samsung C5212 Duos with a 16GB microSD card and it worked just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ergonomics of Samsung C5212 Duos are commendable, so is the build quality. The phone is not the most compact of handsets but sure stands out among the Dual SIM kind.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard UI, refined Dual SIM section<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung C5212 Duos interface has the typical Samsung styling, which does not come as a surprise given the down-market positioning of the device. There are no innovations or upgrades in terms of extra features in the C5212 Duos, except for the dual SIM interface. That is why, in this brief preview we'll concentrate on it, leaving the rest for a possible future review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No fooling around about its key asset, Samsung C5212 Duos makes sure the dual SIM handling is up to scratch. Some of the limitations that were noted in phones like D880 and D780 are now dealt with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The master and slave SIM card hierarchy still holds of course. There is still a default (primary) card that will take all the action unless the user says otherwise, but this time both SIM cards are fully operative in terms of GPRS/EDGE coverage. That wasn't the case before, as data connections were only handled by the default SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, when you start a web browser or another service that requires a data connection, you are prompted to choose which SIM is to be used. Of course, if you know you will always use only one of the cards for data connections, you can set it as default and you'll stop seeing the "Select activating SIM" menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you think the frequency band limitation we encountered in D880 and D780 is sorted you're right. But it's sorted quite radically. Both D880 and D780 have tri-band support for SIM1 and dual-band support only for SIM2. Now, that alone rendered them useless as a dual SIM solution in areas that have the 1900 MHz band such as North America.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the C5212 Duos chooses to obey simple logic and skips the tri-band support altogether. It's a fair trade by all means. Dual band support makes sense in a low-end handset, plus you get both SIM cards enabled for data connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you insert one or two SIM cards in Samsung C5212 Duos for the first time, you need to assign them names and prioritize them to get started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature allows you to assign a graphical icon to each SIM card too. This is a very handy extra identification of your SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you are done, you can start reaping the dual SIM benefits. If you need to make changes to that setup later, you can open the simple SIM management interface by pressing the dedicated key on the handset's right side. The interface is accessible from the Settings menu too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Call management, phonebook and messaging specifics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming/outgoing call the caller number/name is accompanied by the name of the SIM card which is receiving the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you want to call somebody, all you need to do is select the phone number and then choose which card to use for the outgoing call. The primary SIM is default and pressing the call key directly dials the number using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if you wish to call using the secondary SIM card, pressing the dedicated SIM management key switches the SIM card for the outgoing call. There are no delays or glitches whatsoever using this feature. We are particularly pleased with the Samsung implementation of this interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The major update here is that when toggling the two SIM cards, their labels are no longer displayed at the bottom of the screen taking too much space. Tiny icons appear instead in the top status bar to indicate which SIM card is being used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is also very well geared to accommodate the dual SIM functionality. It displays the type of call (incoming, outgoing, etc.), the SIM card, the caller number/name and the number of calls. When you select a log entry, you can see the entire call history, including the time and date, the SIM card again and the call duration. You can opt to return the call using the default SIM card or the secondary one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new number can easily be saved in either the phone memory or on one of the two SIM cards. The new feature here is that the contact list has four view modes: phone memory, SIM 1, SIM 2 and phone and SIM simultaneously. With the D800 both SIM card numbers were listed in one tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook itself displays the name, the default number (when a name is highlighted) and the memory used for contact storage - an icon to the right for SIM 1 and SIM 2 designates where the contact is stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a new message doesn't differ from any other Samsung phone and is much like making a call. If a message is sent straight away it goes through the primary SIM card. However with a single press of the dual SIM key, you can channel it through the secondary SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are other dedicated dual SIM card menus concerning the data calls settings, networks and profile customization. However, none of them has undergone any changes compared to previous dual SIM phones so you can consult our detailed reviews of Samsung D880 and Samsung D780.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung C5212 Duos is a neat dual SIM mobile phone with classic bar design, comfortable controls and a basic but practical set of features. It is probably going to be the cheapest dual SIM solution by a respectable brand on the market. It's also the most compact and looks attractive enough for the estimated price bracket. We won't hesitate to recommend it, as we think it will deliver for its target users.</paragraph>
