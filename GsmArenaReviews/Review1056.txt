			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, this may as well be the first against the last of their respective kind. Nokia would gladly try and sell you PureView in various wraps and Android-powered cameras are not unheard of, but a shootout like this one isn't very likely to repeat itself any time soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been a while and we don't know which is worse - the itch in the forefinger or the coat of dust on our Nokia 808. Both have just been idle for too long. But you know what, nothing's going to scratch that itch better than the best camera ever put in a mobile phone, and a brilliant set of web, social, media and cloud connectivity that Android brings to a proper point-and-shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're about to see yet another digicam take on the PureView, and one would think that, having survived a Canon and an Olympus, the Finn has little to worry about. We can see a point there but it's a lot more complicated than it seems. And hey, we're not complaining. We like it when it's complicated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is the Nokia 808 PureView and the Samsung Galaxy Camera are not each other's alternative. People interested in the Galaxy Camera most likely have a smartphone already, and most likely a droid. It would only make sense to a fair few it seems, to keep a second smartphone, be it the most spectacular cameraphone ever made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera on the other hand, has all the smart you look for in a smartphone - except the phone bit obviously. A superior selection of apps makes Android better connected, while Symbian is, we're sorry to say it, a platform without a future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately though, image quality will be the focus of this article, and things here aren't as straightforward as they seem either. The PureView has a wide-angle lens, but the Galaxy Camera's is wider. Samsung's digicam has a bigger and more capable Xenon flash than the Nokia 808 - the Finn on the other hand has an extra LED flash to use in video recording. We were quite impressed by the 4x lossless digital zoom of the PureView but it cannot really match 21x optical zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the extra-long zoom might be both a blessing and a curse for the Galaxy Camera. Believe it or not, the proper digicam has a smaller image sensor than the phone. And yes, we all know by now that this isn't just another cameraphone. The Galaxy on the other hand isn't your average point- and-shoot - it's a connected camera and thanks to Android you can browse the web on it, play media and instantly share your stills and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two gadgets and we don't want to have to choose. We have two shutter keys at half-press and hopefully it will be at least a little easier for you to make up your mind. It's been a while since we had a Nokia and a Samsung in a straight head-to-head. Let's not keep anybody waiting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To get it straight, the Galaxy Camera isn't the most portable digicam, just like the Nokia 808 PureView isn't the most pocketable smartphone. The good news is both devices have plenty to show for it: a massive sensor in phone terms, and plenty of zoom for a point-and-shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera also has the biggest and highest-res viewfinder ever to be found on a camera. So, most users would be more than willing to forgive the fact that the Galaxy Camera just won't slip into a pant pocket. At 128.7 x 70.8 x 19.1 mm, the Samsung digicam weighs a rather hefty 300g. Keep in mind that it's 19.1mm at the thinnest part. It gets to 34mm at the lens, while the grip is 28mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a proper grip though, with a pleasant rubbery finish, providing a secure hold. Another thing to note is that the lens barrel and the grip are nearly level, so the device is reasonably comfortably to use for things other than photography, such as browsing pictures or the web, or any of the countless apps available for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera is clearly bigger than the Nokia 808 PureView. The smartphone weighs almost half as much at 169g and stands at 123.9 x 60.2 x 13.9. It's a top-heavy device in portrait but the finish is quite grippy for a comfortable hold. It may have made sense to match the bump around the lens with something that would've served as a grip when held landscape in camera mode, but the device still allows a steady and secure hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's look at those screens. Samsung used a 4.8" HD Super Clear LCD unit of 1280x720 resolution, which is better than anything we've seen on a camera in terms of both size and resolution. LCD is probably the right choice for a point-and-shoot camera too, considering the oversaturated colors on Super AMOLED that could affect your judgment of the scene and choice of settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView makes a different choice but AMOLED makes perfect sense on a phone. The 4" nHD (640 x 360 pixels) display is based on Nokia's ClearBlack technology and, although the resolution is far from impressive, the screen tops our all-time sunlight legibility chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sensors and lenses<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera uses a 16.3MP backlit CMOS sensor, while the Nokia 808 PureView relies on a 41MP front-lit CMOS. The 808 PureView a sensor that's more than 3 and a half times bigger than that of the camera: 1/1.2" against the Galaxy Camera's regular 1/2.3".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1/1.2" image sensor has 41MP resolution, but the maximum resolution for still photos is 38MP in 4:3 mode and 34MP in 16:9 mode. Yet, the PureView mode is likely to be most often used, giving you the enormous benefit of pixel oversampling and the impressive loss-less digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on the resolution selected, you can zoom up to 4x (but just 2.2x in 8MP mode) without sacrificing the picture quality. You can do the same with the videos, and the digital zoom there jumps to 12x in 360p, but only stands at 4x for FullHD footage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An imperfection of the Nokia 808 lens is their relatively long minimal focus distance. This means that even in macro mode, the PureView is unable to focus on anything that's less than 20cm away from its lens. Its macro capabilities aren't nearly as good as those on some competitors, but you can, at times, make up for that if you use the zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera is a digicam proper and it expectedly offers a few more manual settings (aperture, shutter speed). There are less restrictions too (variable aperture, focal-length, 21x optical zoom). Actually, the zoom length is what places the Galaxy Camera above the mainstream point-and-shoots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting thing to note is that while the two contenders have equally bright F/2.4 lens when used in their default wide position, the Galaxy Camera lens maximum aperture drops all the way to F/5.9 when you zoom in. A smaller aperture (indicated by a larger F-number) lets less light pass through the lens, so the Galaxy Camera is forced to up the sensitivity to make up for that. The higher ISO settings mean more noise though, so it's not like it doesn't come at a price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the great versatility of the zoom lens is enough to give the Galaxy Camera an advantage in terms of optics, but the Nokia 808 PureView has a clearly superior sensor. It would be extremely interesting to see how those two compare in our tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both Samsung Galaxy Camera and Nokia 808 PureView pack a xenon flash, though the one on the Galaxy Camera is clearly more powerful. The xenon on the PureView has an operating range of 4 meters, while the Galaxy Camera manages up to 6 meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PureView 808 has a single-LED flash to serve as auto-focus assist and be used as video light. The Galaxy Camera has a typical red auto-focus light, but nothing to help low light video capture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView has just two hardware controls that are relevant to the camera app: the shutter key and the zoom lever (originally a volume rocker). Everything else is accessible via the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more buttons to press on the Samsung Galaxy Camera but all the camera settings are only reachable on the touchscreen anyway. Centrally placed at the top is the Power/Lock key: press-and-hold to power up, then short presses to sleep/wake. A comfortably big and very responsive two-step shutter key is on the right surrounded by the zoom lever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On grip side of the Galaxy Camera you get (top to bottom) the 3.5mm audio jack, the microUSB port for charging and computer connections, and a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A small button at the top on the opposite side releases the pop-up xenon flash. Push to lock it back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, the flap of themicroHDMI port is cut out in the actual battery cover. The SIM bed and the microSD card slot are in the battery compartment. The tripod mount hole is centrally placed at the bottom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 808 PureView</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface of Nokia 808 PureView is pretty straightforward. Along the right edge of the viewfinder you'll find the still/video camera toggle, the virtual shutter and the gallery shortcut. There's a setting shortcut in the top middle that is labeled with the currently enabled mode (e.g. "C2 8MP" is custom setting #2, 8MP resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left edge of the camera changes depending on which mode you enable - it can be as little as a flash mode setting or as much as a column of five settings you can adjust manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available capturing modes to choose from - Automatic (for the pure point &amp; shoot experience), Scenes (if you want some control) and Creative (which puts you in the driver's seat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except in Full resolution, all other modes get you the enormous benefit of pixel oversampling and the impressive loss-less digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatic mode produces 5 megapixel images, using the PureView oversampling technology, which are of pretty good quality and have a file size that makes them easy to share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes let you give the phone a hint about what it's photographing - snow (a lot of white reflective surface), spotlight (a dark stage with the band in the bright spotlight) and so on and are good enough if you're in a hurry. There's instant preview how the photo will look if you go for the selected scene. Just like automatic mode, Scenes produces 5MP 16:9 photos and you can't change that. Your photos are still a product of the oversampling technology and you still have control over the loss-less digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to Creative mode - it gives you full control of the camera and you can pick what sort of a resolution you'd like the camera to produce. You can go for the full-resolution mode or keep to the PureView mode to enjoy extra sharp and noise-free images thanks to oversampling. PureView produces 5MP photos by default, but you can choose 3MP or 8MP as well. Loss-less zoom is present in the three resolution modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has devised a handy way to zoom that they call "Slide zoom". You put your finger on the screen and drag up to zoom in and down to zoom out. You can use the volume rocker too. How much you can zoom in depends on the resolution you've chosen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The implemented zooming gesture allows you to keep both hands on the phone and zoom using your thumb only. This reduces camera shake, which can make the difference between a tack-sharp image and a blurry mess when you have zoomed in too far in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don't worry - the slide zoom doesn't mean you don't get touch focus. You do - in fact, you can tap and hold on the viewfinder to get several focus modes (Automatic, Close-up, Hyperfocal and Infinity).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creative mode also lets you pick the aspect ratio of the photos (4:3 or 16:9), JPEG quality (Normal and Superfine), color tones (Normal, Vivid, Sepia, Black &amp; White), capture mode (Normal, Bracketing, Interval, Self timer) and finally, sliders for saturation, contrast and sharpness. You can also enable a viewfinder grid, control the focus assist lamp and the waking the phone with the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Creative mode, you also get access to several controls in the viewfinder. You can adjust the exposure compensation (and you get a histogram while doing so, which is really cool), set the ISO (from 50 to 1600), change the flash mode, the white balance and the neutral density filter (which can be set to Off, Automatic and On).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface looks a lot like the still camera. You still get Automatic, Scenes and Creative modes and their settings are similar to those of their still imaging counterparts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get two extra settings - you can toggle the Video light and the Continuous Autofocus (CAF). If CAF starts hunting for autofocus too often, you can disable it. This will enable Hyperfocal mode, which should keep most things in focus (unless they are less than a meter from the camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With creative mode, you can pick from several resolutions and frame rates. The resolution settings are 1080p, 720p and 360p. For frame rates you get the most popular options - 30fps, 25fps, 24fps and 15fps. This lets you play cinematographer with 1080p@24fps or put the 808 PureView through the indignity of shooting a 360p@15fps video for an MMS message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The really good news is that zooming works in video mode too, even during recording. In the highest resolution mode you get up to 4x lossless digital zoom and that number even goes up as the resolution goes down - 6x for 720p and a whopping 12x for 360p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's Rich Recording technology allows the 808 PureView to record both very low frequencies and very loud sounds (up to 140-145dB) without distortion - they claim it produces "almost CD quality" audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera UI is pretty well designed, too. The right side of the viewfinder has just three controls - an expandable mode key and virtual shutters for both still images and video recording. This means that you don't need to switch modes to record either or stills - you can do both from the same viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera also offers the option to snap a photo while recording video. You just tap the virtual shutter button while recording and you get a 4MP still shot. That's a bit disappointing, considering that the Galaxy S III does 6MP stills while recording video and that one has a far lower-res sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another impressive feature of the Galaxy Camera lets you pause the video recording and continue at a later point. This means that you can combine several scenes in a single clip, without having to use extra software for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the viewfinder has the Home key that will exit the camera UI and take you to the Android homescreen, a shortcut for advanced settings, a small arrow next to it will open a submenu with some quick settings - turn on/off voice commands, flash settings, timer, video resolution and quick share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voice commands are pretty much self-explanatory and all available commands are showed when you turn the option on. Once you enable them, the Galaxy Camera will start listening for specific words. Let's say you mounted the camera on a tripod for a group shot. You just need to say Take a Picture and the Galaxy Camera will do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced settings menu offers three tabs - camera, share and general. In the camera tab you can change the resolution, the focus mode, the white balance, turn on/off face detection and the optical image stabilization, choose shooting mode (normal, continuous, automatic exposure bracketing), set timer or edit metering. The Share tab is self-explanatory, while in the General you can set some sound options, file names, preview settings, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing on the left of the viewfinder is the gallery shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the viewfinder there is a small arrow which pops up the effects menu. We would have prefer some more advanced settings here than those effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the advanced settings are accessible via the Mode key on the right. Tapping on it will reveal three small shortcuts - Auto, Smart and Expert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Auto mode do everything for you and we assume it will be the one to be used most frequently. The Smart is actually scene selection with a few advanced modes - you have the usual landscape, beauty face, night shot, sunset, etc. presets as well as continuous shot, macro, panorama and smile shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama shots is made of 8 consecutive shots, but the output resolution is rather disappointing - just about 5800 x 550 pixels. And the quality isn't that good either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Continuous shot can take up to 20 full-resolutions pictures with single tap-and-hold on the shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other of the modes are similar to continuous shot, where the camera takes a few pictures and you chose which is best to save.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Waterfall mode is rather interesting - you must use a tripod and the Galaxy Camera will take a shot with long exposure to create the desired effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see there are lots of presets to put photography newbies at ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you choose the Expert mode, you'll gain full control of the camera via five virtual lens rings. The smallest inner one offers a few extra modes - Videos, Aperture priority, Shutter priority, Program mode and full Manual mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, as you can see from the shots there are four dialers with settings - you can adjust the shutter speed (1/2000 - 16), the aperture (F2.8 - F8.0), the exposure compensation (-2.0 to + 2.0) and the sensitivity (100 - 3200).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you select the advanced video recording mode, you get only one dial - with exposure compensation. But once you are here you can select the alternative 720p@60fps ultra-smooth and 768x512@120fps slow-mo options from the settings (pop-up menu, top right corner) or dig into even more advanced settings from the additional settings screen launched from the rack-wheel icon (image stabilization, white balance, metering, timer and quiet zoom option).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We recommend the quiet zoom setting otherwise the buzzing zoom gets really annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two camera UIs are completely different and have nothing in common. The Creative Presets on the 808 PureView will do enough job to satisfy the vast majority of the users, but surely they won't be enough for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's where the Galaxy Camera UI steps in with its full manual mode. It also offers more settings in other areas, too, but as a result its menu is a bit cluttered and hard to navigate. On the other hand the full auto and many scenes mode should do just fine for those that don't know what aperture is and what it does.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 808 PureView</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery app on the Nokia 808 PureView displays the photos in a grid (3 columns) and you can scroll up and down (with kinetic scrolling, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to select multiple photos for deletion straight from the grid view. But gallery can't organize images into albums and can't share multiple photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can delete, crop, send or share photos with a handy Facebook shortcut available at the bottom of the screen. You can share a photo on Flickr too, but you have to go through the Share menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only way to organize your images is with tags. Tags are visible between photos in the grid view and you can insert a new tag with a press and hold. Tags with the date are inserted automatically. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to jump straight to a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the images is usually amazingly smooth - you can zoom and pan around 38MP images and the 808 PureView won't break a sweat. Even flicking through hundreds of images in the grid view is fast and effortless. There are only rare occasions when large photos take a while to zoom, but it's nothing major and the overall performance is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When browsing a single image you'll see a button showing the resolution above the picture. A tap on it will reveal every single detail that is available for the picture - resolution, files size, date, ISO, white balance, location, even histogram.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery offers editing options too - adjusting image properties (including an auto-levels feature), cropping, rotating, flipping and resigning, along with adding effects, clipart and frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ColorizIt app is also available, which creates a specific effect - a black and white photo with parts of it in color. The Silent Film Director app let's you create old-school looking clips (like a 20's film with the characteristic silent movie soundtrack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera has the new Gallery app we saw on the Galaxy Note II and the Galaxy S III running Android 4.1.2. It opens up in Albums view, but photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces), Group and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also switch between three view modes - rectangular grid, 3D grid and 3D spiral (which is the coolest but the least useful of all). In each of the three view modes, you can pinch zoom to make the thumbnails bigger. Unlike Sony's gallery though, you only get two zoom levels here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album, the app switches into a split screen mode. The left side shows the folders, while the right displays all the photos in a rectangular grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find Share, Delete and Menu buttons above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera lets you select pictures from several different folders for batch operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the photos are displayed in full resolution the Galaxy Camera had no problem with panning, zooming and scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have an integrated crop tool within the gallery, but tapping on the edit button will offer you to open the image within the Photo Wizard or the Paper Artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo Wizard is TouchWiz's standard image editor and offers the basic set of imaging tools - resize, rotate, crop, picture adjustments (color, saturation, temperature, etc.), add effects or decoration, and some useful tools for portraits (red-eye removal, air-brush face, out of focus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Paper Artist editor allows you to transform a photo into paper sketches. The samples below explain everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the image gallery and editing options on the Galaxy Camera are far more advanced than this simplistic image viewer and editor on the 808 PureView. We don't know if the Samsung device will be our first choice for taking photos, but it's certainly better than the Nokia offering at viewing them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FoV, Zoom and other things<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we dig into the image quality portion of this review, let's go over some important qualities of both cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Field of view is a measurement of just how much fits into a scene. Holding both the Samsung Galaxy Camera and the Nokia 808 PureView in the hand, it's pretty clear that the Galaxy has the wider lens. Things are far clearer if switch to 16:9 mode as the 808 has a clever sensor that doesn't lose a lot of resolution, but the Camera is still at an advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an illustration of the difference in field of view for both cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is zoom - both devices have zoom capabilities, but they are quite different. The Samsung Galaxy Camera uses a traditional optical zoom setup like you would find on most point and shoot cameras. It offers 21x zoom (20.9x to be precise) and you can get a close up of distant objects easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView relies on its high-resolution sensor instead - in 8MP PureView mode it can zoom up to around 2.3x by gradually reducing the amount of super sampling it does. At maximum zoom, it just gives a 1:1 pixel view. You can zoom more but you have to drop to 5MP or 2MP mode for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While optical zoom is good because quality doesn't degrade much as you zoom, the sensor of the 808 is very good even at 1:1 view. Still, the difference in maximum zoom is massive as can be seen in the next image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera can only zoom in discrete steps but they are small enough that it doesn't matter. Having a zoom lever is very handy and Samsung will be enabling pinch zooming with an update soon. Nokia's Slide zoom is quite good too - it works with only one finger and is continuous. You can use the volume rocker to zoom as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Later we'll look at how zooming affects image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that the Samsung Galaxy Camera and the Nokia 808 in 8MP PureView mode take photos at about the same speed. If you're shooting at full resolution with the 808, however, it takes noticeably longer - a couple of seconds or so. Also, the Galaxy Camera has burst shooting capabilities, which can really help capture just the right moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Camera starts off with an advantage - its lens is wider, it has twice the number of pixels and the zoom capabilities are great. The Nokia 808 PureView isn't out of the running though, its big, high-resolution sensor allowing it to keep the pace.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality - good light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera and the Nokia 808 PureView are quite different in terms of imaging hardware and software. As a result, they're quite different in terms of image quality too. We've prepared crops to a couple of collages to help judge the quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start of with photos shot in good lighting conditions with no zoom, the devices were held in the hand. For the Nokia 808 we used both 8MP PureView mode and Full resolution mode to see how it stacks up with the 16.3MP Galaxy Camera photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first 100% crop is very telling of the image quality difference. Despite having double the pixels, the 16MP shots from the Galaxy Camera just don't look nearly as detailed as the 8MP PureView photos. The 1/2.3" sensor shows quite a bit of noise, which drowns out a lot of the fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 takes advantage of its super sampling abilities to eliminate the noise and images look much sharper. The bigger 1/1.2" sensor also has an advantage in dynamic range - there's a lot more detail in the dark bushes compared to what the Galaxy Camera managed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are fairly accurate though they can be a little muted. The Samsung camera is close too, though it chooses more saturated colors (especially in the green channel).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second 100% crop throws the 38MP full resolution mode of the Nokia 808 into the mix. The noise in the Samsung Galaxy Camera photos once again smears out fine detail, but there's chromatic aberration coming from the lens too. The Nokia 808 PureView offered more detail in both 8MP mode (which uses super sampling) and 38MP mode (which just renders pixels as they are).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some full-resolution shots if you want a closer look at the whole image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoom is a big feature for the Samsung Galaxy Camera, so let's see how it does. As it turns out, the droid camera really starts to come into its own when you zoom in. We tried it at 2.2x zoom, which just about matches the maximum zoom of the Nokia 808 PureView.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the Galaxy Camera actually improves when you zoom it. The Nokia 808 photos still have less zoom (even though it can no longer take advantage of super sampling), but the results are very close indeed. Of course, this is just the beginning of how much the Galaxy Camera can zoom, the Nokia 808 can go no further - there's not even digital zoom (which we wouldn't recommend using anyway).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the full resolution shots we used for the zoom comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took a couple of macro shots. The Galaxy Camera was able to get really close to the subject, while the 808 PureView had to shoot from a distance. The full resolution shots below were taken from the same distance to level the playing field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Samsung Galaxy Camera doesn't have a very big sensor, you can still get a relatively nice depth of field effect with the macro mode. The effect isn't as pronounced in Nokia 808 PureView photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to split our conclusion for this chapter into two - with and without zoom. Without zoom, the Nokia 808 PureView is clearly the better shooter - even in 8MP PureView it offers much better image quality and the ability to shoot 34MP/38MP (depending on the chosen aspect ratio) while maintaining a lot of that quality is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With zoom, however, things start to level off. At two and a bit times zoom, the maximum the 808 can achieve, the Samsung Galaxy camera has almost caught up. And it can go well beyond 2x zoom as we saw in the previous chapter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality - low light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both devices feature xenon flash and testing their low-light performance is a must. We tried out two scenarios - flash off and flash on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start with the flash off shots as they will give us an idea of how each camera does in poor lighting conditions. We took photos both with night mode off and on, as night mode can improve but also degrade image quality, depending on the situation (it slows the shutter speed, which improves quality, but increases the chance of camera shake).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is why we took several shots and we've selected both the best and the worst to judge if the risk is worth it. We were standing about 1.2m (4 feet) from the chart when we took the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera proved to be very good in the dark - it took very acceptable even without night mode and there's very little difference between the best and the worst shots is minimal. Night mode takes several photos in quick succession and stitches them together. This means you have to hold steady for longer - both you and your subject (landscapes are still, but a person might move). Night mode does reduce noise a bit and practically eliminates the difference between the best and worst samples, but again, it's only good if your subject is sitting still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView struggled more with this assignment. Note that its Night mode works only in 5MP 16:9 mode, you can't use it for 8MP or 4:3 photos. Photos without Night mode were shot at 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 808 PureView used shutter speed as low as 1/8s (both with and without Night mode), while the Galaxy Camera settled for 1/15s. This makes the effects of hand shake much more noticeable. Overall, if you have steady hands and you're shooting landscapes it pays to switch Night mode on, otherwise you better take your chances without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also have a look at the full resolution shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, both the Samsung Galaxy Camera and the Nokia 808 PureView have xenon flashes - a rarity among mobile phones, but standard fare for point-and-shoots. We took a step back (we were 2.2m / 7.2 feet from the chart) and enabled flash. With it, both devices consistently took good shots, so we're only showing the best photos here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below is an image with 100% crops along with an overview of the full image. The 808 PureView photos have only half the resolution of the Galaxy Camera photos, but they have more detail, even though the Galaxy photos have very clear traces of oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smaller xenon flash inside the Nokia, however, provided less illumination and it was focused at the center of the image. The Samsung Galaxy Camera has a brighter flash that lights the scene evenly. The Samsung camera offered better (if a bit too cold) white balance too, the 808 photos came out with a slight tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Nokia 808 PureView photos taken in low light with xenon flash on won't be as well lit, but they'll usually have more resolved detail. The Galaxy Camera does noticeably better in terms of lighting the scene, but the image quality it produced is a little worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full resolution shots with xenon flash are available below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While not perfect, the Samsung Galaxy Camera takes the win here - it performs tangibly better with flash off and its more powerful flash leads to more pleasing illumination of the shots when it is on. The Nokia 808 PureView doesn't do too hot with flash off, but under the right circumstances you can tease out more resolved detail from it when flash is on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera shoots 1080p videos at 17Mbps bitrate, which should compensate for the slightly wider field of view compared to the Nokia 808 PureView whose videos are shot at 14-16Mbps on average (though they can get as high as 20Mbps, depending on the scene). That's what you would expect anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the difference in the field of view of both cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is a video shot in good lighting conditions on a tripod. We'll be looking into image stabilization and low-light performance later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos shot with the 808 PureView have more detail in them, however, things that are discernible in its clips get smeared away by the Galaxy Camera. You can see it clearly in the lower half of the 100% crops below, the thinest branches are a lot sharper in the 808 video. The Galaxy Camera applies strong sharpening (as evident by the halos), but that doesn't help it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as dynamic range goes, both cameras are about equal. The Samsung Galaxy Camera actually seems to have a slight advantage in this department, but it produces videos with low contrast. The Nokia 808 PureView makes full use of the range offered by the video codec, while Galaxy Camera videos look a bit flat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not a lot to be said about the framerate of the videos - both can shoot 1080p videos at 30fps and the results are as smooth as 30fps gets. The 808 PureView has additional options of 24fps and 25fps, which might appeal to film buffs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, after seeing the 720p@60fps mode on the Galaxy Camera, even good 30fps videos look a little choppy. The PureView doesn't have such a mode, so we can't compare the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as white balance is concerned, the Nokia 808 PureView gets fairly accurate results but it errs on the yellow side. The Samsung Galaxy Camera does what it did in the still camera mode - slight saturation boost and a cooler white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer to do your own crops, you can grab a short sample from the Samsung Galaxy Camera (0:09s, 18.8MB) and from the Nokia 808 PureView (0:08s, 9.8MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera still has a couple of tricks up its sleeve though. The first is Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) over the Nokia 808 PureView's digital stabilization. We put the two devices together and shot a video to compare how well each approach works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having a proper optical stabilization makes a world of difference. It's especially noticeable when you're trying to hold still - the 808 videos look jittery, while the Galaxy Camera video is very stable, with only a slight wobble. The effects of stabilization are also visible during panning though they are slightly less pronounced. The Galaxy Camera even manages to correct relatively heavy shaking, which looks pretty bad on the Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second advantage is the zoom - you get the full 21x zoom while shooting video with the Galaxy Camera and thanks to the OIS you get good videos too (without it the shake would be magnified proportionally to the zoom, rendering the video unusable). A cool feature is the Quiet zoom mode, which makes sure that none of the noise coming from the lens motor as it moves is recorded on video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Nokia 808 PureView can zoom too - maybe not 21x, but 4x (at 1080p, 6x at 720p) is still pretty good. And just as with the still image, the zoom is "lossless". The quality does degrade, but that's only because when you zoom in, the camera has to give up on the super sampling. Here's how much is lost - we shot a video without zoom and then stepped back and zoomed in to 4x so that the chart would appear the same size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and this zoom is quiet too - there are no moving parts to make any noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we should note here is that Samsung Galaxy Camera doesn't have touch focus and you can't turn Continuous autofocus off (which can get a bit overzealous and cause constant refocusing). The Nokia 808 PureView has both touch focus (even during recording) and an option to switch Continuous autofocus off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio is captured in stereo at 128 Kbps bitrate and 48 kHz sampling rate for the Galaxy Camera and 256Kbps and 48kHz sampling for the 808 PureView. The Nokia is boasting special mics that should allow it to record sound as loud as 140dB without distortion, which gives it an edge though. If we had to take one of those to a concert, we'd certainly side with the Nokia.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison - low light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera won back some points when it came to low-light still photography, so we decided to check it does in the dark when shooting videos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The xenon flash is of no help here and it's the only flash that the Camera has. The 808 PureView has a video light LED, which while not too strong and useless for objects located too far can help for up close shots. Note: videos were shot at 1.2 m / 4 feet from the chart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera has its video stabilization to rely on, which should help (it helps on the Nokia Lumia 920), so we shot these samples from the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos from the Samsung Galaxy Camera look lighter, but again they have less detail than those shot with the 808 PureView. The big sensor along with super sampling manage the keep the image virtually noise-free. Switching the video light on improves things further, mostly in terms color rendering.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we started this article we thought that the Samsung Galaxy Camera and the Nokia 808 PureView might have a lot in common - a great camera package with a smartphone OS to extend their functionality. It turns out that they are pretty different and will get different people interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera is great for the social networking photographers. With built-in 3G or LTE you can upload photos straight to Instagram or Facebook or Twitter or Google+ or anything really - we can't think of a popular web service that lacks Android support. Then there are things like instant upload, image editors, IM clients and everything else in the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to actual camera features, the Galaxy Camera offers impressively long zoom, manual controls, as well as 60fps and 120fps slow-motion videos that are nothing short of impressive and unmatched by phones (too bad YouTube doesn't support them). It also has the best screen in the camera world - by far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all good though - the Camera is bigger than most micro four thirds and costs as much. Most disappointingly, it is miles behind them in terms of actual quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 808 PureView ? Samsung Galaxy Camera GC100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView, however, comes very close - readers of our blind test favored the cameraphone over an Olympus PEN E-PL2. The 808 can easily be a backup camera for keen photographers. And it fits into the smartphone category even if it has to hunch a little.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it lacks is apps - there's no official Dropbox support, no Instagram, few custom camera UIs and image editors. Still, with working telephony on penta-band 3G and free offline SatNav, the 808 PureView can be a great companion for tourists with an interest in photography. And the not-so-rich Symbian app ecosystem manages to conjure up things like Skype, WhatsApp and Viber to save you the roaming charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The revolutionary Nokia 808 PureView was the last hurrah for Symbian and, while we hope its amazing sensor will make it to new Nokias, the 808 itself has almost reached the end of the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no secret we keep one in the office - as something that stands for the gold standard in mobile phone imaging. Will we keep the Galaxy Camera? Well... maybe... if Samsung are kind enough. Ha-ha, nice one. No, in actual fact, we won't. But we can see connected cameras hitting it big. And this particular one is quite likeable, though maybe something with less zoom and a bigger sensor would've made more sense. And perhaps the size of a Canon PowerShot S110.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Nokia 808 PureView is the smartphone equivalent of a decades-old world record. A combination of genius, inspiration and hard work - and perhaps a bit of good luck - that's just impossible to match even if all the ingredients are there. We don't think anyone was surprised at the Nokia 808 PureView getting the better of another digicam. But we won't be surprised either if connected cameras do to cameraphones what Android did to Symbian.</paragraph>
