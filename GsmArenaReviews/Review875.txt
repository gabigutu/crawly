			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony is the first to deliver a smartphone, which wouldn't let size get in the way of performance or screen quality. It's no accident that it's a compact rather than a mini - the Snapdragon 800-powered beast would be ashamed to share a name with the upper-midrange (at best) wannabes of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've had this for two years now - Android flagships growing in size faster than the US national debt, leaving those in search of a premium phone that doesn't need its own seat on the bus with an increasingly tougher puzzle to crack. You could either defect to iOS at the cost of a two or three month's worth of rent or live with a chipset and screen that are at least a year old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email boxes were spammed, comment sections were trolled, petitions were posted but not a single Android smartphone manufacturer dared go against the grain and create a mini that's actually worthy of its big brother's name. Not until today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hard to believe? Just take a look at that spec sheet:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the first thing you look for in a smartphone is screen real estate, you might just not find that sort of credentials exciting. If a huge screen is an absolute must, be it for gaming or video watching, then you are excused if the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact doesn't get your pulse racing. In all other cases you have no choice, but to admire this Japanese creation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A smartphone barely bigger than an iPhone 5s, that's got the latest chipset available in the market, a high-res camera and a screen that, at least on paper, should provide splendid image quality. Compared to the full-size Xperia Z1, the Compact is only some screen resolution and battery juice short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, when you think about it, 1080p would've been an overkill on a 4.3" screen, adding to the battery drain rather than the image quality. And with the reduced screen consumption the smaller battery shouldn't be an issue either - it's as big as what the Xperia Z offered anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, there's no doubt that the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact has the makings of a winner. But if it was all decided on paper, you wouldn't really be reading this - unless it's the specs you're buying. And with that kind of specs, we can understand. But anyway, let's see how the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact does in real life, shall we?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, you wouldn't exactly call the retail package of our Sony Xperia Z1 Compact rich in content. There's the smartphone itself, an A/C adapter and a microUSB cable. Headphones were missing and we didn't get a microSD card either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, these things vary across regions, so you could receive a better treatment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 Compact 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 127 x 64.9 x 9.5mm, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is a full 17mm shorter and 9.1mm narrower than the full sized Xperia Z1. This makes a huge difference in terms of both handling and pocketability, and the Compact is easily worthy of its name. Its footprint is only a tad larger than that of an iPhone 5s and you get an extra 0.3" of screen diagonal to show for it, so there's little to complain about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The profile is hardly as impressive though, as the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is notably thicker than the flagship, but the truth is at this size it doesn't make that much of a difference. The smartphone will still fit in any pocket and the only downside is that it will create a slightly bigger bulge. The weight of 137g is about average these days and, at this size, strikes a good balance between solid feel and portability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Glass-covered front and glass-like hardened plastic on the back panel, garnished with a one-piece metal frame that runs all around - the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is definitely a looker. Sony is using the same two-stage process as on the big Z1 to anodize the aluminum frame and has finished the middle of the sides for a two-tone look, which works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly thicker profile takes some of the cool away, so we wouldn't say it's just as impressive as its bigger brother, but the Compact is a solid phone, a premium package no doubt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, if it wasn't for the Apple iPhone 5s, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact would certainly be the most attractive smartphone in its class. As luck would have it though, it will have to settle for the silver. It's not a distant second, mind you, and some would probably even find glass more attractive than metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the choice of materials has its downsides too - the glass and plastic panels are easy to get covered in smudges and some effort is required if you are to keep the Xperia Z1 Compact looking its best. The thing is that glass doesn't offer the best of grip. The handset does feel slippery but, at this size, this isn't too big of an issue. With no stretching of the fingers required during operation you are far less likely to drop it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The diminutive Sony flagship is pretty well put together, too. There's weight and substance for a nicely solid feel in hand. There are no gaps between the panels and it gives away no disturbing sounds when handled normally. Knocks against the middle of the back panel will sound somewhat hollow, but that's not something you will be doing often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally we'd give 8.5 out of 10 to the Xperia Z1 Compact for design - the only penalties being for the less than stellar slimness and the dock connector gap on the left.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact's layout of controls similar to that of its bigger sibling. You get an RGB notification light on top of the display, alongside the proximity and ambient light sensors and the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facer is a 2.1MP unit, enough resolution for 1080p video. The status LED is hidden inside the earpiece this time around. It's a bit small and, being inside the recessed earpiece, visibility at an angle is worse. Again, we would have liked to see a large strip below the screen - there's plenty of unused space there to begin with, and big RGB strips are both attractive and easy to see as previous Xperia designs have demonstrated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the area beneath the screen perfectly bare, all the important stuff is on the sides. There is a camera key here, located on the right side, underneath the signature Xperia power key and the volume rocker. Unfortunately, the shutter button, useful as it may be for launching the camera from anywhere, is very tiny and inconvenient. It's better than nothing, but we often resorted to using the on-screen button for actually taking photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the back panel fixed, the card slots are located under two flaps on the left of the Xperia Z1 Compact. The microSD goes near the top, underneath the microUSB port, which is covered by a flap of its own. The microSIM slot is further down the same side, after the docking pogo pins. All those flaps are hardly the most convenient solution, but they are necessary for the device to live up to the IP58 dust and water protection rating and certainly improve looks too - too many holes on the side would have looked bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone holds the 3.5mm audio jack that has been left exposed. That's not a cause for concern though as the jack has been waterproofed. The loudspeaker grille at the bottom is pretty large, and in a few minutes we'll see if that translates into actual output - the Xperia Z1 wasn't the loudest handset around, so here's hoping the Compact does better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone is one big slab of scratch-resistant plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the back holds the headline feature of the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, the 20.7MP camera lens, along with the LED flash. The camera module has a wide 27mm Sony G Lens with a fast F/2.0 aperture and a Sony Exmor RS back-illuminated (BSI) sensor, which is 70% bigger than the majority of smartphone camera sensors. There's also a secondary microphone here - neatly tucked under a small grille at the top of the back panel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display with a right attitude<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact comes with a 4.3" Triluminous display backed up by the company's proprietary X-reality engine. On paper, 720p resolution sounds like a serious step down from the full-HD screen of the regular Z1, but at this size it still results in the more than pleasing 342ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the screen is tack-sharp and you wouldn't really feel any downgrade at all - in fact 1080p would probably have been an overkill at this screen size, and a strain on the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is sharpness is not all the Xperia Z1 Compact display has going for it. It also offers excellent contrast with impressively deep blacks, bringing every image to life. Color accuracy is pretty great too and there's even a setting for manually tuning the white balance if you aren't perfectly happy with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, Sony has finally managed to get the better of its oldest rival when it comes to smartphone screens - viewing angles. The Xperia Z1 Compact is by far the best performing smartphone in that department to come from the Japanese company. There's only moderate contrast shift when you go to extremes, but everything on the screen remains legible no matter how wide the tilt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alas, the sunlight legibility isn't as spectacular as the rest of the screen, but it's not too bad either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All in all, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact display may not look like it on paper, but it actually has the best display we have seen by the company in a while. Granted, the sheer size makes the regular Z1 screen a bit more impressive to look at, but per-inch that's the highest quality the Japanese have delivered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact packs a 2,300mAh battery - 700mAh smaller than that of its larger sibling, but it also has a far smaller screen of lesser resolution. So how do those balance out?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite successfully as it turns out - the Xperia Z1 Compact posted an endurance score of 65h in our dedicated test, faring excellently in the web browsing and video playback tests. It easily bettered the achievement of the full-size Xperia Z1 proving that Sony made the right call going for a 720p screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface with small apps, themes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact comes with Android 4.3 out of the box, while its big sibling launched with 4.2.2. Still, the software looks very much the same and that was on purpose - Sony didn't set out to just make a compact phone, they wanted exactly a compact Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes our usual demo video to get you started. Those of you who have used the big Z1 will notice how familiar it looks and those who haven't will get a feel for Sony's latest UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multiple lockscreen panes contain one widget each. A swipe to the rightmost pane will fire up the camera (the stock Android setup). Widgets are collapsed by default, but you can swipe down to expand (and back up when you're done and want to unlock the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen panes can accommodate various widgets: Email, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, TrackID and Digital clock. You can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is on, the lockscreen will display the music controls by default, but they can be swiped out of the way. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact lets you add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background for the virtual on-screen buttons is black when you are running an app and completely transparent when you are browsing homescreen panes and menus. Some of the basic apps (phonebook, messaging, calendar, etc.) set both the status bar and the on-screen button background to grey instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add stuff to the homescreen just tap and hold on a blank area or pinch to zoom. A context menu appears, allowing you to apply various customizations: add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. Shortcuts can be pulled from the app drawer and dragged across to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The widgets in the Xperia Z1 Compact do resize and re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are four docked shortcuts (two each side of the app drawer shortcut). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items, in which case you get smaller icons of the first four shortcuts in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Brightness by default). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. The toggles are customizable and you can choose between 16 different quick toggles and have up to 10 of them visible in the notification area across two rows of shortcuts. You can even opt out of having the Settings key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there. If you tap and hold on an app, a green Add to Homescreen field will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon and drop it there and you will go back to your homescreen and place a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe. The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a choice of both static and live wallpapers for the Z1 Compact. As usual, you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applying a new theme changes the lockscreen and homescreen wallpaper and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android OS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, all of your multimedia content is saved too, and all system apps such as messaging, call logs, etc. get their data stored safely. Restoring is easy so you can easily bring back anything you may've lost.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, unlike the other Android minis, has a full-blown Snapdragon 800 chipset under its hood. No dual-cores or quad Cortex-A7s here. It is running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean rather than 4.4 KitKat, which may hurt it a bit, but we'll see how that works out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, since it has a smaller 720p screen, the Adreno 330 GPU (which is normally used on 1080p devices) will have an easy job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's start with the CPU first. The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact actually manages to beat its big Z1 sibling in the first two tests, but that's probably within the margin of error for the tests. Geekbench 3, however, shows a more noticeable difference. The Z1 Compact is a millimeter thicker than the big Z1, has Sony improved the cooling of the chipset?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The answer may be "yes" since the Z1 Compact proceeds to win the Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 full-system benchmarks. We also ran Basemark X by Rightware - this test promises to circumvent the ways phones detect benchmarks and boost their clock speeds.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>3D graphics should really be a strength for the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact with its beefy GPU and 720p screen (that's less than half the pixels of a 1080p screen). In off-screen performance, the Z1 Compact is in line with the Android flagships and virtually matches the iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In on-screen performance, the Z1 Compact jumps ahead by a health margin and stays with the iPhone (which has nearly the same screen resolution, just a bit lower).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lighter 3D engine like Unreal that powers Epic Citadel runs into the 60fps software limit. Snapdragon does almost 60fps at 1080p as well, so we're skipping this benchmark.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact shows stellar performance so far, but it gets more average results when it comes to web benchmarks. The JavaScript performance is the usual from Snapdragon 800, though Samsung seems to have an ace up Note 3's sleeve. Still, the Z1 Compact finishes this round of benchmarks with a win in Vellamo.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact has shown true flagship performance and even though the new batch of flagships is months away, they'll probably still run Snapdragon 800 or similar. More importantly, unlike competing minis (they know who they are), the Z1 Compact honors the name of its big sibling, so you won't feel like you're getting a mid-range phone with a shiny name.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know if there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia Z1 Compact gets activated with an upward swipe from a press-and-hold of the Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read out its contents (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a dedicated review of some popular voice assistants, where you can learn even more about Google Now. Just follow this link.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show up as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the contact's photo - the so-called Quick Contact feature - will open a pop-up with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact, visiting their web page or navigating to their home address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia Z1 Compact was nothing short of pleasing. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments. All in all, you'll have no trouble making calls with the Z1 Compact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its bigger counterpart, this phone fits much better in the hand, so long calls are more comfortable. It helps that it's lighter too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad in the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the big Sony Xperia Z1 before it, the Z1 Compact scored a Below average mark in our loudspeaker tests, meaning you are likely to miss some calls and notifications if you are in a noisy environment. That's probably the trade-off for the phone being watertight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, but that made virtually no difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, you'd be better off turning on the vibration and the xLOUD enhancement to make sure you don't to miss any incoming calls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even star them to make them easier to find. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS. Four shortcuts at the bottom of the screen handle the most common cases - an image, a photo, a doodle (you draw with your finger in Sketch) and your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox for all your email accounts. It supports batch operations and has a Preview pane option in landscape mode - the list of emails goes on the left, the contents of the currently selected email on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is the default app that handles instant messaging (Facebook is preinstalled, but Facebook Messenger isn't). It can handle regular text messages too, though unlike iMessage you have to manually switch between SMS and IM and the two conversation threads are kept separate. At least now there's an 'online' indicator for contacts so you know it's safe to send them an IM. Unfortunately, those aren't visible in the message thread itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia Z1 Compact offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard, which is comfortable enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're going to enable auto correction, you might want to let the keyboard learn your writing style by reading your Gmail, Facebook, Twitter or messages you've sent (each of these can be used individually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard also comes with three skins pre-installed, which can help if you want to use a darker theme.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Smooth gallery with great functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can resize the image thumbnails, either with a pinch gesture or a sideways swipe. The whole thing is very responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a smooth animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second tab here, My Albums, which includes online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) along with albums stored on devices in the local network. Alternatively, you can turn the Z1 Compact into a DLNA server and view photos from the device on a computer or compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here are some special albums - Maps and Globe, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTPC-style video player needs just a bit more work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI, reminiscent of HTPC interfaces. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 format and won't pull info about individual episodes. It gets worse, Gracenote seems to be lacking info on TV shows in general, we couldn't find even popular shows like The Big Bang Theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that Sony has fixed up its codec support and the Xperia Z1 Compact plays just about everything - AVI (DivX, XviD), MP4 and even MKV. Just about. DTS, DD and AC3 audio are not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does support subtitles and it gives you access to both sound effects (the same as the Walkman music player) and display settings (X-Reality, White balance and Brightness are of interest here).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The updated Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. It features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on tiles that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player with your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen shows a carousel with the tracks in the current playlist and the usual music controls below that. You can swipe left and right to move between tracks and view the current playlist (where you can rearrange the songs). If you tap on the album art three more buttons appear - add to playlist, star and the Infinite button. The latter will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's the familiar ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is also on board. The Listen Now feature tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has updated the FM Radio app and as a results it's now more stable than it was on some recent midrange Xperia smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is clean but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact did excellently in the active external amplifier part of the audio quality test. The smartphone posted great scores top to bottom with the below average volume levels being the only weak point to its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better still, there's only a slight quality drop when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises significantly, but distortion remains undetectable and signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range remain great. Volume levels are below average here as well, so we can't give perfect marks for overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 20.7MP camera promises much, but underdelivers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact camera uses the same custom-built Exmor RS sensor as the big Z1. It's the highest resolution available on an Android smartphone and matches Lumia 1520 latest 20MP PureView camera (without the optical stabilization though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of the Sony Exmor RS family it's a backside illuminated (BSI) sensor, plus it has a wide F/2.0 aperture. These are all good things for low-light photography, though the flash is only a small, single LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact uses a wide-angle (27mm) Sony G Lens camera with a Sony BIONZ image processor. Sony has literally equipped the Xperia Z1 Compact with all the latest tech they have on tap, and that's just the hardware, the Z1 Compact is very impressive on the software end, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that immediately makes an impression is how smooth the image is in the viewfinder - it looks like they are using a high refresh rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface, however, is a little old-fashioned and confusing at times. It consists of two columns, the right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, shutter keys for the camcorder and the still camera, and a shooting mode button. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The column on the left changes more substantially. Here you get a flash mode toggle, front/back camera toggle and the settings button, which brings out a panel with some settings. These settings will change for the different shooting modes, allowing you to tune more or fewer stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, in Manual mode you also get a "manual controls" shortcut here, which sounds more impressive than it really is. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, but those are buried in the settings menu. And that's all - with a name like that we were hoping for some manual focus, or at least a way to tune contrast, saturation, sharpness and so on. Those are, you know, the settings normal Android phones get even without buzz words like "manual mode."</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode proved to be somewhat frustrating, too - it limits photos to 8MP resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio. We guess this is Sony's answer to Nokia's super sampling tech (a.k.a. PureView mode), but with such a resolution drop you may feel like you are not getting what you paid for. Especially since unlike the Lumia 1020 you can't keep both the full resolution shot and the down sampled shot (the 1020 saves both a 38MP and a 5MP image). That of course, is not entirely true. As our tests have showed, the 8MP shot have excellent levels of detail and have less noise than the 20MP shots. But you'll see more about that further down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and the Manual mode when everything is set to Auto (yup, you can set the Manual mode to Auto) is supposedly that the Superior Auto tries to guess what kind of a scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all image parameters accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual shutter keys are nice, but the Xperia Z1 Compact also has a hardware shutter key. It's quite tiny and many people would probably find it uncomfortable. The good thing about it is that you can set it up to unlock the phone and starts the camera. It can also snap a photo or start capturing video immediately. This might come in handy for those occasions when you want to capture something fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact camera offers a plethora of built-in features but we found that some are missing and others are hard to find. The available options include face detection, smile shutter, geo-tagging, touch capture (with Burst option) and tracking auto-focus. You can't manually select a scene - you hope Superior Auto lives up to its name and that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia Z1 Compact offers several more interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama, which, unfortunately, is not quite user-friendly. You have to move the phone at just the right speed, not too fast, not too slow. This caused the Xperia Z1 Compact to abort the panorama several times just because after pressing the shutter key we hesitated for a second to begin the sweep. Also, panoramas come out with 5MP resolution and the file size clocks in at under a lousy megabyte. Both the iPhone (5, 5c, 5s you name it) and the Galaxy S4 shoot panoramas with tens of megapixels resolution, so the Z1 Compact panorama is... let's just say, underwhelming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs visual cues to track your motion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed - the resolution drops to 1080p and the graphics are unbecoming of a Snapdragon 800 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Info-eye feature is similar to Google's Goggles app. It can recognize text, business cards, QR and barcodes, landmarks, bottles of wine and even book covers, too. Sony has partnered with leading companies in the respective fields to provide info (e.g. Amazon for books, Vino for wines, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works quite well and provides enough at-a-glance info and if you scroll down, you get a wealth of further information. Sony has utilized the Google Now card design, which helps organize info in an easy, digestable manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time. Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 61 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to the image quality. We'll start off with full resolution shots from Manual mode and then we'll look at the Superior Auto shots. We've also done low-light shots to see if all the brand-name camera elements have paid off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can safely conclude that the 20MP camera on the Xperia Z1 Compact captures more fine detail than the 13MP cameras of the competition, so the extra resolution is not a marketing trick. Colors are accurate if slightly under-saturated and the white balance is good, slightly warm. The maximum image sharpness at 100% is perfectly good and the photos come out well balanced and pleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, it's not all roses and sunshine. We are quite unhappy with the lens quality of the unit we had for review. It reaches maximum sharpness only in the center and the rest is noticeably blurry. Of course, that may be due to the pre-release status of our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 20MP shots have average amount of noise but the good thing is that it's mostly luminance noise as opposed to the more unpleasant chromatic noise. What's not that good is the sharpening algorithm of the camera sharpens the noise by the image sensor making it more pronounced. This is more noticeable in the more blurry areas, closer to the edges of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sharpened noise patterns remain visible even in Superior Auto mode though they are a lot less. Still, while you're unlikely to view a 20.7MP image at 100%, you're more likely to do so with an 8MP image - Superior Auto produces images just the right size for UHD screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd be first to admit that the Superior Auto 8MP shots have their benefits over the full-res ones. Most of the noise goes away, while there's still plenty of fine detail. File size also drops from 5-6MB to around 2MB, which makes storing and online sharing less of a pain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The down-sampled 8MP photos look slightly better than they would if you simply downscaled the image yourself. The color rendering is different; it's punchier and produces more pleasant-looking photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In high-contrasty light conditions, they also have a sort of a toned down HDR look, so we would guess it's one of those things that makes this Auto mode Superior. The 8MP images may turn out to be the better choice after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has an HDR capture mode, but it's available only in Manual mode and then only at 8MP or lower as the output resolution. The HDR mode doesn't work at 20.7MP. Here are two shots, one with HDR off and one with HDR on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without making the contrast too low. That said, in this sort of scene Superior Auto produces some quite usable images too, a middle ground between the regular manual and HDR modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shooting in low light makes the noise stronger and you'll need a steady hand as handshake is common. The LED flash doesn't change much but that extra light is enough to bring the noise down a little. Downsampling in Superior Auto is once again beneficial as it lowers the noise, too, and you might want to use it in darker scenes where there is not much detail to begin with, so the downscaling makes no harm anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that the LED flash was virtually no help. It's not really powerful enough for shooting from a distance (around 3m in this case).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We uploaded the full resolution 20.7MP photos to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution monsters (like the ones from Nokia). You can use the tool's downscaling feature to match another phone's resolution or view photos at 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia Z1 Compact in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll notice that the Xperia Z1 shots look better in places. Those were shot with Android 4.2.2, while the Xperia Z1 Compact shots were with 4.3. At the very least, Sony has changed the noise reduction and sharpening parameters, but there may be more changes under the hood. One thing is clear though, the company still hasn't found the perfect settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We included Superior Auto shots in our Image Compare tool, as well. This way you can see how this mode compares to the rest of the competition and the untouched 20.7MP shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia Z1 Compact with Superior Auto mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notice how the image gets softer in certain areas - part of that is due to the lens and part due to the new processing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps and that's about it. With the inclusion of the powerful Snapdragon 800 SoC we would've liked to see 1080p video recording at 60 fps or even 4K but we guess that's just too much to ask from Sony at this point. In any case, there aren't too many 4K screens around yet, so it may not be such a big loss. 1080p is still competitive enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder app UI is practically the same as the still camera's. You can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the Z1 Compact features a proprietary SteadyShot digital image stabilization, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilizations work). The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an actual HDR setting and scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but that's not of much use as you only get 1080p images, you might as well grab a frame from the video. Also note that the image processing is different than still shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is a reasonably powerful camcorder. It captures 1080p videos at just under 30 frames per second with a good bitrate of 17-18Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 128 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results are pretty good, but not perfect. There's plenty of fine detail, but colors are off the mark (not enough saturation and a cold white balance). On the positive side, the videos are smooth with a framerate of 29.7fps with minor variations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The continuous autofocus is much too eager and triggers all the time, even when there's barely anything in front of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact has quad-band 2G and penta-band 3G connectivity across all regional models, and support for more LTE bands than you can shake a stick at. The LTE is Cat. 4 meaning it can theoretically reach 150Mbps downlink and 50Mpbs uplink. Outside LTE coverage, the Z1 Compact is rated for mobile data speeds of up to 42 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use it through the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers). Sony still adds ANT+ to its phones too, which is another popular wireless standard for sports accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact features NFC too, but there's no app to handle the NFC functions out of the box. Luckily, there are plenty of capable NFC apps in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go support, so you can attach external flash drives to the smartphone as well. The MHL-enabled microUSB port also supports HDMI connections to an external monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A minor annoyance comes from the fact that the microUSB port and the docking pins are on the same side of the device, the same design flaw the big Z1 had. You can dock the phone to make sure it's being charged, while outputting videos over HDMI, but you'll struggle to find a comfortable position, as even an L-shaped micro-USB will cause the dock to wobble unless you place it on an elevated surface, like a book or something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, replacing the former LiveWare manager. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or during a time interval (e.g. mute alarms at night). It doesn't work with NFC tags though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unmatched browsing with Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome now utilizes the Blink rendering engine (a fork of WebKit), so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as the desktop Chrome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs, which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A relatively new setting is called Reduce data usage and does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone. You can check the graph to see how much data you've saved. Unlike Opera Mini, this mode keeps the full functionality of web pages. Also, secure connections bypass the Google servers for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, keep in mind you can use the Small app browser, which lets you surf while doing other things. You can hit the Open in another app to view the page in Chrome, but there's no easy way to switch from Chrome to the floating browser. Also, there's a Chrome Bookmarks small app that just shows your bookmarks (i.e. it's not a small app version of Chrome).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Document viewer and Google Drive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact comes with the OfficeSuite 7 viewer. OfficeSuite 7 lets you view Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF along with plain text files. It only allows you to view them though, as you'll have to buy the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Drive is on board and it can handle creating and editing documents and spreadsheets, though at the moment it requires an internet connection. The app does support offline viewing, but you'll need a data connection to editing, which may be a no-go for some.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. In Week view, the lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Alternatively, you can use the Agenda view for a list of all recent events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app has made its way onto the Xperia Z1 Compact, except this time its drawing capabilities have been moved to a separate Sketch app. Notes have a title and you can choose a custom background and text color. Font size is customizable too. The app also lets you record voice notes and turn the note into a To-Do list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sketch is pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note/sketch and just start typing or doodling. You can customize a wide variety of drawing modes, backgrounds, and stencils. You can use the app to draw a sketch to send with the Messaging app and there's even Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm &amp; clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own sound and repeat pattern. You can also set whether the side buttons would snooze the alarm, dismiss it or do nothing. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are also available from within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another helpful tool is the Update center, which checks for updates for your phone and your apps. You can enable automatic download with the option to use Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact also comes with Google+ and Facebook apps out of the box. The Facebook app also has a nice widget that will show you updates on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's own Socialife News is on board too. It's a news reader that pulls headlines from web sites and RSS feeds. The app repackages the article in an easy to read format with selectable font sizes to make reading a breeze. If you sign into Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the app will include updates from those services as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is where the apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (many even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, which managed to get a lock in about a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network estimation, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps offers voice-guided navigation in an ever-growing list of countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport (this one is more limited in availability). Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning you don't get all the information down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is the first phone to give up the name but rightfully claim the true title of a flagship mini. It took a while too, considering we've had "minis" for a couple of generations now. It is, without exaggeration, unique in its category thanks to the powerful chipset, 20.7MP camera and water-resistant body. A lot of the five-or-so-inch flagships can't even cover two out of three of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's water resistant designs certainly draw attention, but the sheer size of the big Xperia Z1 turned many away. The seemingly small change - just the size - can make a world of difference. The Z1 Compact is a speed demon (for gamers and power users), it has the looks for daily usage in the city and will brave the rainy outdoors (or just the swimming pool) to take great shots where most cameras would require extra protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all those features, the battery life is pretty good too, thanks to its battery being bigger than the average in this size bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of size, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is about as big as the HTC One mini (shorter but wider) and not that far off the iPhone 5s, and has the potential to get the attention of users looking to jump ship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 800 chipset performance is close enough to what Apple provides with its A7 chipset. Screen size and sharpness go in favor of the Z1 Compact and the still camera (while not perfect) beats the aging 8MP shooter of the iPhone. The iPhone shoots better videos though and its digital stabilization doesn't take as much toll on the field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal frame with glass face and back is old news to iPhone users, but Sony definitely has produced a desirable option for people looking to get away from Apple's pricing, screen size restrictions and software limitations or just wanted to try Android without going plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The waterproofing of the Xperia Z1 Compact is yet another advantage, one that it has not only over the iPhone, but over other Android phones as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 5s</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung and HTC both have minis too, though "junior" is perhaps more appropriate. Both retain characteristic features of their bigger flagship siblings (e.g. front-facing speakers and an aluminum build) but both suffer from heavy cutbacks in the chipset and imaging departments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the 4.3" 720p screen on the HTC One mini is very good and the aluminum unibody looks hot. The camera has one fifth of the resolution of the Xperia Z1 Compact camera though and no OIS. It can't make the pixel size argument either, as the Sony has a larger sensor and superior auto pixel-binning to battle noise. The limited storage isn't doing the One mini any favors either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini screen has a quarter of the resolution of the big S4 screen. It does have expandable storage and some tricks like an IR blaster but its chipset and that of the One mini are not even on the same planet with the Snapdragon 800. Plus, the batteries in both phones are of lesser capacity by about 500mAh.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Then there is, of course, the big Sony Xperia Z1. It's everything the Z1 Compact is other than small, plus the screen is sharper and the battery bigger. It's an amazing phone, but its bezels really are quite large, making up for a phone that's beyond what some will tolerate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is on the same price shelf as the big Z1 (for now at least), which should tell you enough of Sony's intentions. The Z1 Compact is not meant to compete with the two minis above, but rather be an alternative size option to the Z1 flagship. And that claim is well backed-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has finally happened - we have a proper compact flagship on our hands. Is it everything we hoped it would be? With pretty much no deal-breakers, this may as well turn out to be Sony's breakout star this year. The reason to become an ex-iPhone user. A supercharged droid you can wrap a single hand around. A message delivered loud and clear that the diagonal climb isn't the only way up.</paragraph>
