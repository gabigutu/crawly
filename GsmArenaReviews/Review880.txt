			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To get the disclaimers out of the way, this is obviously not coming straight from Beijing's Latin Quarter. Although a certain penchant for all things French is not entirely incredible, you can bet LeEco has a keener eye on neighboring India - probably its biggest potential source of revenue after the home market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brand's ascension to prominence was perhaps faster than anything we've seen - although obviously China's growing and outward-looking industry has been supplying more than enough examples to follow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's always a first time but consider this: it is only a phone from an obscure Chinese company - yet pretty soon you may end up reading first reviews of le what's electric car. Yes, LeEco is all over the place from digital content and film production to smartphones and autonomous vehicles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yes, we may have passed on the Le 1s and the original Le Max, but there was no way we miss the opportunity to review the Le Max 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although it's not the big mac on LeEco's menu - the original Le Max still standing at a staggering 6.33" tall - the Le Max 2 is almost every bit as impressive on paper. It's an all-metal smartphone with a massive 5.7" Quad HD display, powerful Snapdragon 820 chip with 4 or 6GB of RAM, great imaging capabilities and a custom eUI launcher on a Marshmallow core, a combo that did manage to surprise us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sealed battery and absent microSD slot are the rule that makes exceptions that much sweeter, so we are not going to spend too much time on those. Duly noted, let's move on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our bigger concern is the battery. Even with Marshmallow pulling the strings, we're not convinced it's enough for such an ample phablet with such a pixel-rich screen and powerful chipset. Of course, we would love it if the LeEco Max 2 manages to put our doubts to rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are definitely not fans of ditching the 3.5mm audio jack either, especially in a phone that's obviously not even trying to break any slimness records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the Le Max 2 is ready for our detailed hardware checkup and will get every chance to justify all the design choices. We're pulling it out of the box to spin it around right after the break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special thanks to HonorBuy.com for providing the review unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the LeEco Le Max 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 comes in a big box, which hides a few surprises - some nice, some not quite. To start with, a Quick Charge 3.0 enabled A/C adapter is much appreciated. A USB Type-C cable is supplied too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, with or without a 3.5mm audio jack, a headset would've been welcome. At the very least, LeEco did well to provide a compact USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there is a nice transparent silicone case to protect the sides and rear from scratches.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LeEco Le Max 2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 is big and heavy at 156.8 x 77.6 x 8mm and about 185g. The metal chassis explains it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we compare the Le Max 2 to the Galaxy S6 edge+, which also comes with a 5.7" display, the Samsung handset cuts 2mm off of each side and 1mm of the thickness. The S6 edge+ weighs 33g less though, with that dual-glass design and smaller battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 hasn't done anything too crazy design-wise if we don't count the conspicuous accents at the rear - and the pink paintjob. It may as well be rose gold for all we know. The design is based on the original Le Max, using a massive metal unibody with antenna cutouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 is leaning towards slightly more angular looks, while the mirror finish of the fingerprint sensor and the enormous camera are far from subtle. Following a rebrand, the first generation and the Le Max 2 have different logos, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, LeEco went for a market-approved phablet design instead of trying to be unique for its own sake. Some design decisions are questionable - like the missing audio jack - but other than that, the build quality is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal design is as premium as it can get and the Le Max 2 is extra solid. Obviously a handful, it allows a comfortable grip and the subtly chamfered edges are stylish. The bottom grilles for the loudspeaker and the mic are nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not too fond of the massive camera module at the rear and the fingerprint scanner's mirror finish is also too prominent. The unmarked capacitive keys at the front may take some time getting used to. Even though they light up on tap, there's no indication which is which before you've tapped them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 is a 5.7" phablet but one that handles fairly comfortably. The device can be operated with just one hand in certain conditions, but most of the time it takes both. It's not as bulky as the Xiaomi Mi Max though, for a recent reference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The earpiece above the display is flanked by the usual sensors and the 8MP front-facer. Below the screen are the three capacitive keys, which lack any meaningful markings as we already commented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Le Max 2 houses the lone dual-SIM tray. The right one has the volume rocker and the power/lock key, both made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR blaster is on the top side of the phone, while the USB Type-C port, the primary mic and the loudspeaker are at the bottom. There is no audio jack - LeEco have provided an adapter in the bundle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 21MP camera lens is on the back, enjoying plenty of space on a massive hump. The dual-tone flash is around as is the secondary mic (set within the top antenna strip).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 comes with the flagship-worthy resolution of 1440 x 2560px on a 5.7" diagonal. It's an IPS LCD with a standard RGB matrix. There is no fancy curved glass on top of the Le Max 2, nor is there any mention of using any kind of chemically strengthened glass (Gorilla, Dinorex). Perhaps, a screen protector might be a good idea for anyone opting for the Le Max 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles of the 5.7" display are excellent and colors don't shift. There is some contrast loss, naturally, but it doesn't hurt the overall great picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen offers a maximum brightness of 426 nits, which is about average - being an LCD unit, it could have been brighter. Thanks to the deep blacks, however, the Le Max 2 display outed an excellent contrast of 1444:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the color calibration isn't perfect as the whites and grays are off towards blue, but with an Avg. DeltaE of 6.0 it isn't bad at all. Setting the color mode to Soft fixed the whites, but hurt way too much the blue color (deviation of 19). The LeEco mode is very close to the Natural setting, making some colors slightly more saturated but without hurting the average DeltaE of 6. Overall, you should be fine with the screen's color calibration unless you have some color critical tasks to perform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2's solid average performance in our display tests continues into sunlight legibility. A score of 2.57 is a good achievement for an LCD panel and means you'll see what happens on the screen in bright sunlight despite the inevitable loss of contrast and color.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 is powered by a rather modest (for the phone's size and specs) battery of 3,100mAh. It's not user-accessible either. The battery supports QuickCharge 3.0 and in our 30-minute charging test the phone's battery charged from 0% to up to 58% using the supplied QC3.0 charger in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 scored 67h in our test, which means you can count on the battery to last a little short of 3 full days if you do an hour each of calls, browsing the web and video playback a day. This is a usage pattern we've come up with, so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a second SIM card cuts only 3 hours from the total rating. The rating takes a very small hit from an extra SIM, which is great, but the already average standby, video, and browser scores contribute to a rather uninspiring overall endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LeEco offers lots of options to extend the battery life such as Ultra-Long Standby during sleeps, Align Wakeups for wakeup optimizations, and scheduled power on and off. We used the Normal Align Wakeups, while all other battery optimizations were disabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2, being a Snapdragon 820 smartphone, comes with the latest generation modem with rich LTE band support and Cat.12 speeds. It supports dual nano-SIM cards and can tap to an LTE network on either SIM, but once you do, the second one will be limited to GSM connectivity only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support and Wi-Fi Direct. Wireless screen mirroring is available via the Miracast protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, GPS, and GLONASS. There is no FM radio support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 supports USB Type-C - it's the new reversible connector for USB that builds on top of USB 3.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR blaster is located on the top and coupled with the right software, it can be used to operate any remotely controlled home appliance, turning the Le Max 2 into a universal remote. LeEco has its own Remote Control app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>eUI 5.6 on top of Marshmallow OS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, skinned with LeEco's own eUI, already in its v.5.6 iteration. The customizations run very deep and replace everything including all Google services. Of course, the Le Max 2 comes with Play Store and Google Framework in selected markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a familiar affair - it has the clock, a camera shortcut, and no widgets. You can unlock the screen with the fingerprint scanner and the sensor is always-on, so you don't need to wake up the phone first. This is the first ultra-sonic fingerprint scanner we meet, based on the Qualcomm's ultra-sonic technology, also known as Snapdragon Sense ID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The utlra-sonic sensor detects the ridges, pores, and other details on your finger by transmitting sound towards the finger, which bounces back on the receiving surface. In theory, this method should be more accurate and faster than the wide-spread capacitive sensors, which scan a 2D image. Unfortunately, the sensor is not as fast as the one used on the Huawei P9. It takes at least a second longer to unlock and the error rate is disappointing at 2 out of 5 attempts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom by default, and a fifth one (LeTV) you can't change. You can dock any app or even folders with multiple items if you will. But the presence of the Live Le shortcut in the middle is non-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no app drawer - anything you install pops up on your homescreen, which can have an unlimited number of panes. There're no shortcuts and the usual routine of removing icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will, in fact, uninstall the corresponding app. There is a pop-up for confirming the action though, so you can't accidentally uninstall apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost pane is reserved for the exclusive recommended multimedia content by LeEco, if available in your region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap&amp;hold on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Widgets are available too - it's mostly the stock Android ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>UI Themes are available as well. They can swap your wallpapers, icon pack, and system color scheme. A few are available out of the box, but you can download more online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has just one pane that holds all notifications sorted in a timeline. But don't worry, quick toggles are available. You can manage the notifications just like you do in Apple's iOS - you can enable or disable notifications from different apps, choose the notification style and allow/disable on-icon notifications (a small iOS-like bubble with a number).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the Task Switcher key will open an iOS-style menu coincidentally called Control Center just like the one on iOS. Here however it takes up the entire screen. On the topmost row it hosts a few screenshots - IR remote, camera, flashlight, calculator and snap screenshot. Then you get music controls, a brightness scrubber, and a quick toggles row with five being visible at a time. Finally, at the bottom, is the task switcher itself and there is a button to kill all active apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Control Center was, well, inspired by the iOS one, we found it really convenient because of its rich functionality. It took us a while to get used to launch it with the Task Switcher key instead of pulling it up from the bottom of the screen, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, LeEco's proprietary Search pane will let you do a system-wide search across the phone's content. You can fire it up by swiping up anywhere on the homescreen. The tool searches through your apps, music, email, settings, among others. It also searches through the Le Stores. You also get access to favorite multimedia content from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eUI offers a Super Manager app, which will take care of your junk files, give you control over you monthly data, and of course, it allows you to control app permissions and manage the app auto-launch policies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery manager is part of the Super Manager app - you can use its ultra-long standby mode, tweak the wake-up count during the day and night via the Align Wakeup options, use battery-saving modes, scheduler power on/off, or just see your battery usage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 is powered by the latest Snapdragon 820 chipset coupled with 4GB or 6GB of RAM. This should be more than enough to convince anyone the Le Max 2 is nothing short of a powerhouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single-core performance of one Kyro core is as impressive as it can get. The iPhone's Twister is still the champ, but Qualcomm are definitely on the right track as the single-core performance is crucial for a lag-free Android OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core score of four Kryo cores can't match the 10-core Meizu Pro 6 though it's not far behind. The performance is on par with the 8-core CPUs inside the Galaxy S6 edge+ and Note5, which speaks volumes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the Adreno 530 GPU is on par with the Snapdragon 820 competition. It's the most powerful GPU on the market and the equalized 1080p offscreen tests confirms it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Car scene (offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi 5 has an advantage over the Quad HD competition on the onscreen tests as its display runs on 1080p resolution. The Pro 6 is also a 1080p smartphone, but its GPU is inferior.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>BaseMark X GPU benchmark puts the LeEco Le Max 2 on top of all other smartphones we've tested so far, while the ES3.1 score is on par with the other S820 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consistent scores continue over the AnTuTu 6 and BaseMark OS II 2.0 benchmarks, where the LeEco Le Max 2 shows quite the muscle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 is among the most powerful smartphones today, no gimmicks involved. It can get warm only around the bottom, the rest of the body manages to keep it cool under pressure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 has all the power punch anyone can need in the years to come, so there is nothing to worry about its hardware - it's flagship-grade by the book.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook share a single app although there are two shortcuts, bringing you straight to the tab you need. It uses a tabbed interface - recent with dialer on the first and the contact list on the second. And if you need the so-called Yellow Pages - it's the third one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 supports voice call recording and it can do it automatically on each call if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 comes with a single speaker, which turned out to be quite loud. It scored a Very Good mark on our loudness test. The produced sound is quite pleasant with an above average depth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 comes with a custom Gallery app. It defaults to your camera roll, but also supports Albums, and Cloud. You can't resize the thumbs with pinch gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated editor offers crop and rotate options, as well as various effects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 music player is a custom app with a well laid out, easy to navigate interface. It features four tabs - the first one (Me) is an overview with all of your local music - albums, songs, playlists, download manager, among others. The second one is iLive - a music video streaming service courtesy of LeEco music, then you have Music - similar to Google Music service provided by LeEco, and the final iPerformance tab offers streaming of different concerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has a very clean interface, which hides lots of goodies especially in the Now Playing section - the app was able to display lyrics for most of the songs we played.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no equalizers within the Music app, though you can turn Dolby Atmos on or off from the settings menu. The setting enriches the sound, though if you are an audiophile purist, you may find it distorts the audio output to an extent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get one of LeEco's CDLA headphones with an integrated 24bit/96kHz DAC and a USB Type C plug, you may enjoy uncompressed audio tracks in their full beauty. CDLA stands for Continual Digital Lossless Audio and it just means that it's not the phone that does the digital to analog conversion but the headset itself. Unfortunately, we didn't have any of the headphones available for testing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player interface is very basic but there is rich video codec support. It managed to play everything we threw at it (including MKV and WMV files). The AC3 audio codec is surprisingly, supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles (Latin-based and Chinese) and pop-up play are supported by the eUI's video player, too. You can opt for Dolby Atmos sound, there is a Video enhancement for increased contrast and more saturated colors but it requires more power from the battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were a little worried how dropping the dedicated audio jack will affect the quality of the output but the Le Max 2 showed that there?s nothing to worry about. Beside the inconvenience of having to carry an adapter around, the phablet really nailed this part of our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It delivered excellent output when used with an active external amplifier, getting top marks for clarity and garnishing them with nicely high volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Degradation caused by headphones is minimal too with a moderate hike in stereo crosstalk being the only notable change. Volume remained high for a pretty great overall showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>21MP camera with a dual-tone LED flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 utilizes the same Sony IMX 230 sensor with 21MP resolution we saw on the Meizu Pro 6, Pro 5 and the Moto X Force. It is capable of 5312x3984px snaps in 4:3 aspect. The auto focus uses a hybrid system, incorporating phase detect auto focus in addition to the regular contrast detect system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think it's safe to say that Apple's iOS camera UI has inspired many Chinese manufacturers in their respective camera departments. LeEco is no different and you'll probably notice it on the screenshots below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is simple and you can swipe through the different modes - Photo, Pano, Video and Slow-mo. Live Filters are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Photo mode settings you can tweak the ISO, exposure, white balance, contrast, pictures size, among other non-essential stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping from the bottom reveals a bar with advanced modes such as HDR (on/off), Night shot, Square, Beauty, or Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The samples have good dynamic range and a high amount of resolved detail. Contrast, white balance and colors are well handled as well. A certain shortcoming, which we noticed on many of the camera samples we took (not all were published here), was a certain amount of corner softness to the left and to the right. It's certainly not apparent on all samples and even when it is noticeable, whether it's bothersome or not really depends on the type of shot and subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is meant to get an even wider exposure of a scene - bringing back detail in both the highlights and the shadows. The Le Max 2 does a very good job of bringing back detail in tricky scenes. It's one of the better HDR algorithms we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some more LeEco Le Max 2 camera samples.This first one is a regular day-light photo. The next two samples are taken in low-light, while the last one is an HDR low-light at a lower ISO 800 setting (vs ISO 3200), but with mode captured detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas came out very impressive on the Le Max 2. The resulting images are quite big in size. They also have excellent amount of detail, and the colors and contrast are great, too. The noise levels are kept very low without sacrificing the detail, stitching is great (save for the mangled moving cars). Overall - these are one of the best pano shots we've encountered lately and the only thing they could have benefited more from is an auto HDR option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can check out these 8MP images taken with the front-facing camera of the device. Naturally, it's a fixed-focus one but the focus seems fixed way too close to the camera and unless your head fills the frame, your selfies won't come out nice and sharp. It's a rather nice camera, but it's ruined by its implementation. You can still get some pretty nice selfies if your work with its limitations. Of course, the entire thing could also be a bug specific to our own review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've uploaded full resolution (21MP) photos to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution smartphones. You can see the Le Max 2 images are on par with the Moto X Force (bottom left) and Meizu Pro 5 (bottom right), though the Pro 5 produces sharper images. The low-light test puts the Le Max 2 behind those two, with Moto X Force taking the lead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2160p video recording at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Le Eco Le Max 2 shoots videos up to 4K resolution (3840 x 2160px) at 30fps and 1080p videos at 30fps. There's no 60fps option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K videos (41Mbps bitrate) produced by the Le Max 2 are really good. The resolved detail is great, as well as contrast and colors. There is an unusual amount of noise in the shadows even in broad daylight so we'd guess this issue would only get worse once it gets darker. The corner softness, which we witnessed on many of the sample photos we took is, in fact, visible on some of the video samples as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The audio recording is stereo, but is recorded at 96Kbps bitrate and it sounds quite shallow and poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p videos are good as well with great contrast, an average level of detail and nice colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the 1080p@30fps (15s, 37MB) as a direct download too. You can grab the 4K video (12s, 60MB), too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Head to our Video quality comparison tool for a comparative look at the Le Max 2 video recording capabilities. The Le Max 2 does slightly better in good light conditions than the Moto X Force and Meizu Pro 5, but corner sharpness is bad - and issue we saw with some of the real-life image and video samples as well. The Moto X Force (bottom left) rules the low-light scene.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web pages open in the eUI web browser utilizes almost the entire screen real estate, save for the status bar on top and a tiny bar on the bottom for Back, Share, Menu, Home, and Tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser also comes with an integrated ad-blocker but doesn't offer Reading mode.,There is a Night mode option, which inverts the background and text colors and makes it really easy to read at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the browser has its own Download Manager, which is nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 features a calendar that supports multiple online accounts. There is also a Clock app and a Calculator, which eerily resemble the corresponding apps in iOS in both looks and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compass, Weather and Recorder apps also come preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app is clean and simple. It supports different Notebooks, you can add text and images, change fonts, draw with your hand, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled file manager lets you browse through the contents of the Le Max 2 storage. It offers file copy/cut/paste functionality, as well online sharing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WPS Office package comes pre-installed to take care of all your office document editing needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the highlight of LeEco's homebrewed apps is the Super Manager app, which we already mentioned in the UI section. It lets you clean junk files, manage your data traffic, use some battery management tools, and most importantly - control the permissions for each app you install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, LeEco has a plethora of its own services pre-installed as apps. You get LeStore, LeSports, LeTV, and LeMall, among others. You can browse various online multimedia content, but you have to be a paying subscriber to use most of these services anyway.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Flagship-grade design: metal unibody with reasonable grip, the right size for a phablet and the only thing we would have changed is the camera hump;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear fingerprint scanner is always on, but it's not as fast as Huawei's. Still, it does a great job improving both the user experience and security;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.7" IPS display of Quad HD resolution is flagship-worthy with excellent contrast and very good colors. The sunlight legibility could have been a notch better, though;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery endurance rating of 67h is OK for a phablet with a 3,100mAh battery, the web browsing and video playback scores are poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>eUI has taken a lot of cues from iOS and MIUI and yet the result is pretty good. We like the fluid interface on top of Android Marshmallow, the available customizations are welcome;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 820 chipset, coupled with 6GB of RAM in our case, is the one of the best chipsets to get on Android right now and the performance is up to spec;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We experienced some unpleasant heating under the capacitive keys below the screen during more serious loading such as benchmarks;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player has very good codec support and seamless 4K video playback;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio output quality via the supplied USB-Type-C-to-3.5mm adapter is solid with pleasantly high volume levels; getting rid of the 3.5mm jack is a bold decision, which however may backfire down the line;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker scored a Very Good mark on our loudness test. The produced sound is quite pleasant with an above average depth;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of imaging, the Le Max 2 is getting most things right. There is plenty of detail and the contrast, colors and the dynamic range are quite good. The HDR and Panorama modes are capable as well;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selfies are a mixed bag - if you are close enough to the front camera so that your head fills the frame, the quality is top-notch. At an arm's lenght, however, everything is out of focus. It could be just our review unit though so we won't hold a grudge against it;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2160p videos are equally good as the still images from the main camera - fluid framerate, great detail, nice contrast, colors and dynamic range. We only wish the recorded audio was of higher quality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, one has to try really hard to come up with a sillier sounding name but other than that the LeEco Le Max 2 is the real deal. By the way, LeEco will get it right eventually - it's a notable improvement already over the LeTv of old. The name, that is. Because the device is quite good for its price of around $350.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A large QHD screen, the latest premium chipset, metal build, the latest Android and high-res cameras - Chinese superphones have been coming right out of the blue for a couple of seasons now. Meziu, Oppo, Xiaomi have all had their shot and OnePlus didn't think twice to call their debut piece the "flagship killer".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LeEco is no different - it seems though they want to have it both ways. A killer flagship in India, a flagship killer elsewhere. The thing is, the Le Max 2 looks pretty capable of succeeding in this endeavour - a very competitive price, impressive specs and likely easier to get than some of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Max 2 boasts a 5.7" QHD screen and the decision to reduce the size compared to the original 6.33" LeTv Le Max makes sense. The phablet is powered by the Snapdragon 820 with either 4 or 6GB of RAM, packed in a beautiful metal unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le Max 2 isn't prefect, but it ticks enough checkboxes on our phablet checklist to make us happy at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are lots of options out there, which you can explore. Given the Le Max 2 costs about $350, we won't be looking into the Galaxy Note series, or the Apple Plus models, but still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take the Meizu Pro 5 for example. It has an ample 1080p AMOLED display, a powerful Exynos chipset, and some great camera capabilities, all wrapped up into a metal unibody. The mTouch key is one of the best solutions we've seen on the market, while the Flyme OS is probably as good as eUI sans the LeTV streaming services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like the LeEco phones, you should definitely explore the rest of the models. The original Le Max is even bigger at 6.3", offers the same screen resolution, camera capabilities, and premium shell. The chipset is the previous-gen Snapdragon 810, but that's still considered flagship-grade. There is no memory expansion though, but you can get it with 64GB or 128GB internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Le Pro 2 is cheaper, it packs a 5.5" 1080p display and offers a snappy Helio X25 chip. The camera setup is the same, as is the software package. For the lowered screen resolution and the lesser GPU punch you can save up to ?100 depending on the storage options you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is the massive 6.44" Xiaomi Mi Max, some $100 cheaper, because of the 1080p screen resolution and Snapdragon 652 chipset. If you are a fan of MIUI and want a phablet with fast performance and premium design, you should definitely check it out - once it makes it to international waters, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nobody should doubt the Le Max 2 skills and determination. It's one of the better flagship phablets and thanks to its bargain price, many of the shortcomings of this misunderstood foreigner can be forgiven. The industry has been shifting and we suspect that an increasing number of price-conscious buyers will be hopping on the Chinese bandwagon due to the disruptive force, with which it's shaping the traditional markets. The industry will never be the same and we're glad we have front row seats to witness this change in course. This will be fun.</paragraph>
