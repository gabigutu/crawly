			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as Android phones are concerned, Samsung seems to have all the bases covered in the United States. From the Samsung Gravity SMART, all the way to the Galaxy S family of devices, there is a droid for every taste and budget. In the Samsung family of Android phones, the T-Mobile exclusive Exhibit 4G, which will be the subject of our review today, sits somewhere in the middle of the range. It is an interesting hybrid of budget and high end features which, together in its slim body, make it a smartphone worth a lot of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit 4G shares a lot of its internals with the Samsung Galaxy S ? one of the best Android devices to come out in 2010. It packs a smaller, 3.5? AMOLED screen and lesser quality camera. The Exhibit 4G does however, offer Android 2.3 Gingerbread and access to T-Mobile?s ultra quick HSDPA data network. Add all these ingredients in a small, good looking package, and you have a recipe for a great mid-range smartphone these days. Now, let?s see what else the Samsung Exhibit 4G has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the package which the Samsung Exhibit 4G offers, comes straight from last year's top of the line devices, save for the camera unit. Its performance is no different either, and the price has been nicely adjusted so it looks like a pretty good deal. With Gingerbread on board, the device is up to date in the software department as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we are familiar with the key features of the Samsung Exhibit 4G, it is time to see whether the droid will be able to deliver up to the expectations. Hit the next page for a proper hardware inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Exhibit 4G is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package has you fully covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The compact retail box of the Samsung Exhibit 4G is the home of a charger, a microUSB cable, a 4GB microSD card, and a pair of great sounding in-ear headphones. The usual T-Mobile/Samsung leaflets are on board as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit 4G measures 119 x 58 x 13 mm, and weighs 125 grams. These numbers put it in the group of the compact droids these days. The device feels compact and comfortable when held in hand. Its soft feel plastic prevents accidental drops. It is also not prone to fingertips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The purple colored Exhibit 4G unit, which we obtained looked rather feminine, yet there's also an all black version so it's not a girls only club. In fact the black color, coupled with the AMOLED screen of the device, makes it look like it means serious business. In this department, we believe Samsung deserves credit for the color scheme selection of the device, which will make it attractive for a wider range of potential users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will find four buttons at the front of the device, arranged in a fashion similar to its Galaxy S bigger brother ? the home screen button, which is the only hardware one from the bunch, and the touch sensitive Options, Back, and Search buttons. We found no issues with their usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the device is one of its strongest features, which can put a lot of higher priced competitors to shame. The 3.5? AMOLED unit with 480 x 800 pixels resolution displays vivid colors, great contrast and sunlight legibility. Multi touch is present as well. Having such a capable display in a middle class device shows how far ahead of the competition Samsung is in the screen race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the Exhibit?s screen, you will find the earpiece, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, as well as the front facing camera unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device is where the volume rocker and microSD card slot reside. The memory card is easy to access and hot swappable. On the right side you will find only the power/lock key of the droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm audio jack and the microUSB port are placed on top of the Exhibit 4G. The bottom has a faux leather pattern and houses the mouthpiece of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the phone, you will find the 3.2MP camera with its LED flash, and the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a 1500mAh battery under the cover and the SIM card slot. The latter gets inserted into the device much like the hot swappable microSD card. As far as battery use is concerned, the phone easily makes it through a full day of heavy usage including two email accounts in full sync, web browsing, about an hour of phone calls and quite a lot of video game time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Exhibit 4G is easy to handle. The 3.5? screen appears to be a good blend of portability and usability. You can operate the device with one hand without worrying it will slip out of your grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we have to mention that the plastic used for the body is not looking of particularly high quality and we found it to be rather prone to scratches. In fact, our Exhibit 4G got several noticeable marks in just a few days use without being abused in any way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface: Gingerbread and TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit 4G runs Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread, covered with Samsung?s own TouchWiz UI. The usual four docked icons at the bottom of the screen are present, along with the familiar functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the Exhibit?s UI in action. You can see it below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Exhibit 4G supports up to seven homescreen panels, which can host every widget and shortcuts you?ll ever need. However, if you don?t need all seven of them, the unnecessary ones can be deleted. Doing so makes the phone noticeably snappier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the notification bar down reveals the Android notification area. It is majorly overhauled from the stock Android one and holds five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and rotation-lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button while on the homescreen lets you add variety of content on it (a press and hold on the homescreen does the same thing), add or delete homescreen panels, change the wallpaper or quickly access the settings menu Live wallpapers are supported as well. The contextual menu has shortcuts too for search and notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in the vanilla Android). List view is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange icons freely. Icons are shown in a 4x4 grid with a total of 16 icons per menu screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz preinstalled task manager saves you the need to install a task killer. It gives the user details on RAM usage, the amount of free storage and can be accessed through virtually any spot in the UI by holding the home button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a mid-range device, the Samsung Exhibit 4G surely isn?t a powerhouse when it comes to putting it through some benchmarks. Don't get us wrong - It doesn?t do a bad job, but it just can't compare to the dual-core beasts that are currently ruling the high-end market. We ran a couple of popular benchmark tests and here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit 4G is powered by a 1 GHz ARM Cortex-A8 processor, and Hummingbird chipset. The device has 329MB of user-available RAM. What?s important however, is that, overall, we felt no lag or signs of inadequate amount of processing power when we used the droid.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is great as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in the Samsung Exhibit 4G is nothing short of excellent. It has unlimited capacity and all the functionality you could want. The contacts application displays contacts stored in the SIM card, in your Google account or in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz interface has been at work in the phonebook bringing some special features. Instead of just flick-scrolling the list of people in the phonebook, you can search the entries by either typing the name of the person in the search box or by using the alphabet scroll at the right side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main contact list view hides some useful shortcuts too. Swiping your finger to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer. The side-sweeping shortcuts are part of the TouchWiz UI and work in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Exhibit 4G handled calls great. It held on to signal everywhere we took it and the in-call quality was superb. There were no dropped calls either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works beautifully. Tap a digit and it searches both contact numbers and names for it. If more than one contact is found, there?s a number and an arrow, which show you the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is situated within the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, which can be filtered to show only certain type of events.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messenger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As a typical Android device, the Samsung Exhibit 4G packs a lot of punch in the messaging department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging application itself is quite straightforward. It has a new message button and bellow it are all the received messages organized in threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same swiping functionality found in the phonebook has been integrated here as well. A swipe to the left starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application-specific search lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to a text message automatically turns into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email can be handled either by the standard Gmail app or the generic email app. The Gmail one supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too. The latest update made the Gmail app even better by adding more customization options such as different ringtones for each mailbox, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email application is used for all your other non-Gmail email accounts and supports multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input is handled by the preinstalled SWYPE virtual keyboard. You can swipe your way across the keyboard to type the desired word. When there is more than one option, the suggestions come quite handy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Exhibit 4G uses the standard Android gallery, which is great. It offers the good functionality, we?re accustomed to, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. Online albums at Picasa show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also organize the photos by date via a button in the top right corner which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Facebook Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has everything you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of the Samsung Exhibit 4G is quite impressive. Along with the standard mobile video formats, it supports DivX videos right out of the box. Playing large video files was smooth and easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen controls offer play/pause, skip, and volume buttons. There is a 5.1 channel surround sound available when using headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The stock audio player has been among the weak features of Android OS since its very beginning. Thankfully, Samsung?s TouchWiz UI has taken care of this issue in quite a stylish fashion. You can sort the music using the sorting options, which are neatly displayed in a tabbed interface. Among the options are current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music experience on the Exhibit 4G can be enhanced thanks to the included equalizer in the settings menu. The disc view of the albums and tracks provides additional eye candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as usability and looks go the music player on the Exhibit 4G is top notch and offers everything from creating playlists to enabling equalizer settings and enjoying an enhanced audio experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera has nothing to brag about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit 4G is equipped with a 3.2 MP snapper with autofocus, capable of producing images of 2048x1536 pixels resolution. The camera unit is equipped with LED flash as well. Unfortunately however, a dedicated camera button is missing from the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI of the camera itself is touch-friendly and has great built-in features such as smile shot, preset scenes on-screen guidelines and panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual quality of the photos is decent for the 3.2 megapixel league. Contrast is only average, but there?s a good amount of detail and noise is kept pleasingly low.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording is so-so<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are an HD videos buff, then the camcorder of the Samsung Exhibit 4G will surely not be your cup of tea. The D1 video recording resolution however, might just make the cut for most people at 720x480 pixels. It will allow you to take some decent videos and upload them to YouTube and other video sharing sites without being utterly embarrassed about their quality. The TouchWiz interface is nice and intuitive. It allows you to apply a few different color effects to your videos, should you feel a bit more artistic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a short video sample from Exhibit 4G?s camera. See it below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Exhibit 4G is worldwide roaming-ready with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSDPA with download rates of up to 21 Mbps. The latter has flawless coverage in the New York City area, and makes the using of mobile data on your device a pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity package offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.3 Gingerbread enables Bluetooth file transfers, so there?s little else to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit 4G packs a tad over 500MB of user-available internal memory, and comes with a microSD slot with support for cards up to 32GB. Thanks to Android Gingerbread you can install compatible apps on the SD card as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Exhibit 4G hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall any self-respecting Android smartphone should offer the complete connectivity package and the Exhibit 4G delivers on it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser does not disappoint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device. It?s relatively fast, generally bug-free and really easy to use. In the case of the Samsung Exhibit 4G, the browser supports flash and multitouch, so it is a breeze to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history. Most visited is self-explanatory and history shows your last visited pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the web browser of the Exhibit 4G offers a great browsing experience. The device?s AMOLED screen only enhances it further, making it feel like it is in a different price range altogether.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer has been TouchWiz-ed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Coming to the organizing skills of the Exhibit 4G we have no complaints. It has a nice preload of apps and those that are missing can be downloaded through the Android Market easily and in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has been given the TouchWiz treatment and is very good. It has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. The voice recorder is good too and offers the same usability as on a Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app is nice and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get Stopwatch, Timer and World Clock options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also have the notes application on board. It?s great and offers perfect usability. You can store as many notes as you like and even change the color of the note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make things even more attractive in the office department, there is a Thinkfree Office editor preinstalled. You can view and edit all the popular office file formats right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we cannot find anything to complain about regarding the office capabilities of the Samsung Exhibit 4G. Should you decide that you need something extra, the Android Market is full of options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The refreshed Android Market has gotten even better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After its recent redesign, the Android market will now offer you books and movies on top of the already familiar apps and videogames. The new look of the app is sleek and easy to navigate. You get all major sections on the left side, and featured apps or multimedia on the right and top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the major content departments is divided into subsections which can be scrolled horizontally. Accessing content is easy and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread and a 1GHz CPU on board, the Samsung Exhibit 4G will run any app from the market effortlessly. Even graphic intense games were not a problem for the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps is a must-have<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit 4G packs a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about five minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is on board, complete with Navigation, including public transportation directions from the latest update, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is not a problem in the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps has evolved a lot since it came into being. The latest version offers a nice 3D looking render of the buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such a complete package which keeps getting better, Google Maps needs no alternative at the moments. Should you decide that you want to be different, you can explore the Android Market for other options. Just keep in mind that they will be paid and will come short from the Google experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps from T-Mobile and Samsung<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As a carrier branded device, the Samsung Exhibit 4G comes with several preloaded apps which are worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app for example allows you to stream your Samsung?s content to another device over your Wi-Fi network. Its setup is easy and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lookout is an app which helps you backup your device and protect it from the lately popular malware and spyware attacks on Android. Its most important option however, is helping you locate your precious droid in case it is lost or stolen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi calling has been a T-Mobile staple for some time now. For an additional $10 towards your wireless plan, you can make unlimited calls over a Wi-Fi network. The setup is easy and the potential to save money is huge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T-Mobile TV is a self-explanatory service. For an additional $10 a month, you can stream most of the popular TV channels in the United States straight to your droid. The zippy HSDPA network makes this an easy exercise. All you need to do is be prepared for a rapid battery drain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T-Mobile name ID is an app which displays the name and location of each unknown caller. The location is based on the area code of the caller?s phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a preinstalled video chat client, courtesy of Qik. Given the recent developments regarding Skype and Google Talk video calls however, we doubt that you are going to need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Media Hub is a multimedia store which you can access through your Exhibit 4G. You can download or stream the latest movies or TV shows. Given the recent improvement of the Android Market however, the app is up against some serious competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally there is the standard Samsung diary app on board. It allows you to share your thoughts on a daily basis, and add pictures and multimedia to them. The current weather display is a nice touch too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After spending a good amount of quality time with the Samsung Exhibit 4G, we really couldn?t find much to frown at. The device was up for all the tasks we threw at it and, while not being a benchmark monster, we are quite confident it won?t disappoint you either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the Samsung Exhibit 4G can be purchased from T-Mobile for $99.99 with a contract, or $299.99 without one. It is important to note here that there is a multitude of authorized resellers who might offer you a more enticing price on the same device. Yet it's by far not the only droid at this price point, so think twice before taking out the cash. We have selected a few of the more notable alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Droid Incredible 2 and T-Mobile MyTouch 4G are the HTC made options. Both devices will offer you better cameras and more memory. They will however, fail to impress you as much as the Exhibit 4G in the screen department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Droid Incredible 2 ? T-Mobile MyTouch 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Vibrant is another option which is available for T-Mobile. It does have Super AMOLED screen and higher resolution camera but lacks the zippy HSDPA data of the Exhibit 4G. And believe us, it does make a big difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Vibrant</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like Samsung in CDMA flavor, the recently released Conquer 4G for Sprint seems like a great alternative as well. Just keep in mind that its screen is a TFT unit with lesser resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Conquer 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Exhibit 4G is a device, which will immediately put you at comfort when using it despite some of its shortcomings. This is something which we cannot say about a lot of more expensive droids.</paragraph>
