			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever since the Aria, HTC have had a petite Android on offer and the HTC Explorer is the latest in the line. With an affordable price tag, the plucky little smartphone will appeal to people looking for a compact set or users who are just about getting started in smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer's outer shell is made of patterned plastic that has a rubbery feel to it - creating an impression of ruggedness to match its name. The plate of brushed metal at the center of the rear backs that up too. The phone is not actually shock proof but we still appreciate the tough feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer earns extra points for handling too thanks to its compact size. The diminutive body and rounded corners make it feel like a pebble in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Small as it is, the Explorer has Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread with Sense UI 3.5 on top, just like its elders. Here are the rest of the specs along with the downsides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer leaves behind the old ARMv6 processor and moves to the Snapdragon S1 platform that comes with ARMv7. What's the difference between v6 and v7 you ask? Some apps need v7 to work, the Flash player for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor is clocked quite low, but we still might see some performance boost compared to the HTC Aria and even the Wildfire S. The 3MP fixed-focus camera doesn?t sound very exciting either, but the HTC Explorer is an entry-level device and higher specs would've run the budget dry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Get ready for the first round of orienteering - we'll be navigating the HTC Explorer's box and the phone's hardware. Don't worry about getting lost, the Explorer is a small and easy course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scant retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer comes with a very modest package - just a compact charger and a microUSB cable that pairs with it. We know it's an entry level model, but we were hoping for a headset - you can plug any old pair of headphones, but still, a headset would have been much appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We caught a few unboxing videos on the Internet and found that it wasn?t just our unit that came without the earphones. We also received word from some of our readers, confirming the lack of a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll also need to procure a microSD card of some sort as the Explorer comes with very limited storage out of the box. Really, any would do, even an old 512MB. Without one, you can only snap several photos before running out of space. You'll need more if you want to put some music in there, of course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Explorer 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer measures 101.3 x 59.4 x 12.4 mm and is smaller in real life than it appears in pictures. It?s entirely made of plastic, tipping the scales at the acceptable 105 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the phone's faux rugged cover - the rubbery, patterned texture makes the phone look like it can take some rough treatment. The brushed metal plate is an eye-catching accent that you wouldn't expect in the Explorer's price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you look closely at the rubbery plastic battery cover, you'll see some mold seams that ruin the impression somewhat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the overall design is a faux unibody - the screen and the phone's internals can be pulled out of the battery cover, just like, say, the Sensation. The Explorer tries to emulate the rest of the Sensation's looks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will be available in a variety of colors and the selection will appeal to the younger crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer has a 3.2" LCD display with HVGA resolution (320x480 pixels). It's not the sharpest display around (you easily notice the jagged small type), but viewing angles are quite good for the class - contrast deteriorates when the screen is viewed at an angle, but it's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are a bit dull for our taste, but the contrast beats even some mid-range droids and the display is fairly bright. Overall, it's a really good display considering the price tag. As you have every right to expect, the capacitive screen's response is top-notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are our measurements of the Explorer's screen and how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you'll find the earpiece, along with the proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the device are the usual four capacitive keys: Home, Menu, Back and Search. The capacitive keys are small but well-spaced, with precise vibration feedback for comfortable use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Explorer, you?ll find thee microUSB port for charging/data connections. It's left uncovered, to dash all hopes that the Explorer might be waterproofed in any way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, there's the volume rocker. It's thin, rubbery and has a very low profile - that is to say, not very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the device there is a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (also left uncovered) and the power/lock button. It?s not very easy to locate by touch, but the thin control is long enough to hit even if you just aim for the general direction of the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece and a tiny lanyard eyelet are the only things to note at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is quite attractive - the patterned plastic is nice enough, but it's the brushed metal plate that really classes up the place. That plate is home to an engraved HTC logo and the 3MP camera lens. Just to the side of the plate is the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1230 MAh Li-Ion battery. It?s quoted at 485/445 hours of stand-by in 2G/3G and 7:40/7:30 hours of talk time (between 2G and 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery you'll find the SIM card slot. Off to the side is the microSD card slot - it's not under the battery, but you need to remove the cover to access it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer is a solid little mini whose most compelling feature is the diminutive size. It feels like a pebble in the hand and we have no major complaints about the build quality. The phone can probably take a few knocks, just don't take it too far as there's nothing special protecting it, not even a scratch-resistant glass for the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The variety of lively colors is a point in the Explorer's favor. There's little stopping you from popping on another color after you get bored with the original case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The little Explorer is progressing very well through the course for now, time to see if it has the smarts to round off this review on a positive note.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense/Gingerbread combo looks good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer comes with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread and a spruced-up version of the HTC Sense, v3.5. Like the HTC Rhyme, the Sense UI on the Explorer has had some custom touches to it - though they are different from the Rhyme's. In the case of the HTC Explorer, the interface had to account for the lower-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's start from the beginning. Here's a video demo of the latest Sense UI running on the HTC Explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC lockscreen has to be the most functional lockscreen we've seen yet. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During charging, a battery graphic appears that shows the charging progress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer comes with just a single lockscreen preinstalled, you can't pick a different style like you can on its bigger siblings. Unfortunately, there're no extra lockscreen styles to download off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the Sense homescreen. The old scroll arc at the bottom is now gone and replaced by a straight line over two buttons - the app drawer and dialer. It's simpler and better looking. It's also more thumbable than what we saw on the Rhyme (which does have a bigger screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are seven homescreen panes as usual and scrolling between them is looped. Another difference from the Rhyme is you cannot add and delete panes. There are 7 of them and that's non-negotiable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Leap view is a trademark Sense UI feature. Tap the home key (while on the main homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well. There're just no Add or Delete icons at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with the proprietary HTC Scenes ? essentially several custom homescreen setups. Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets, but those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer came with a single preset Scene, but you can easily download more or create your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can choose between two different sorting options - alphabetically or most recent - but you can't rearrange them manually. Alternatively, there's a list view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget, you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are three different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting widget is the Shortcuts &amp; Clock widget. By default, you'll find it on the central homescreen. It's a full screen widget that shows time and date along with weather information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also features five shortcuts that are not simple buttons but more like drawers - Messages, Music, Camera, Internet and Market. Tapping on the right side of each (which can be a little tricky on the small screen) opens up the drawer. There you'll find things like the last received message, music controls and track info or the latest shots you've snapped with the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add different shortcuts if you don't like the default ones, but they won't offer the extra capabilities of the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag it across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which obviously deletes the widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. The usual press and hold of the Home button will launch the actual task switcher. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful app that HTC preloaded is the usage monitor - it tracks you data, call and message usage. There are apps in the Market that do the same, but this one is styled to match the rest of the interface. We wish it had a widget to let you monitor usage at-a-glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled on the HTC Explorer as well. The apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before turning the phone off, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran some benchmarks to see how the HTC Explorer stacks up against other droids in the compact class, both old and new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Benchmark Pi, it does pretty well. It's not much slower than a Sony Ericsson Xperia active, which has a good 400MHz clock speed advantage. It blows past the old Wildfire S though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Linpack it's a similar story - the Explorer offers nearly double the number the Wildfire S got, but it's far behind the faster Snapdragon chipset of the Xperia Active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't have NenaMark 2 scores for the older models, so we did a quick comparison in Neocore. The HTC Explorer, Wildfire S and Sony Ericsson Xperia mini both have HVGA screens, but the mini uses Adreno 205 while the other two use Adreno 200. The Adreno 200 in the Explorer is supposedly boosted and it shows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did a quick comparison with mid-range phones with faster chipsets. Keep in mind that the HTC Sensation XL and the Samsung Galaxy W have over twice the resolution to deal with. Still, the Explorer does pretty well, especially considering the problematic performance of the XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also used those two for our browser tests. While those numbers don't usually mean much (whether a script runs in 10ms or 20ms, you probably can't tell the difference) but the slower processor on the Explorer puts it to a disadvantage: heavy JavaScript will tangibly slow down performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well organized phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Explorer's phonebook is rich in features and quite good at the social networking stuff. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. Version 3.5 of Sense merges the Phone and People apps into one. So, you have the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook or your HTC Sense account. Unfortunately, Twitter isn't on that list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of contacts has two lines per entry, the contact's name and their latest SNS update (with an icon to identify the social network used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. The interface is tabbed here but it has been reorganized and the new view makes more sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is called Thread - it lists regular messages, email and call history with that contact. It's the next tab, Updates, that handles the social networking side of things - it lists both events from online calendars and SNS status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth and last tab holds the online galleries of the contact, including Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Explorer. The Transfer app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had no reception-related problems or poor in-call audio with the HTC Explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the numpad). The HTC Explorer has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer also knows some accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer while placing it down starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Explorer fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Good mark, so missed calls are unlikely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Explorer are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can set the preview to be one, two or three lines). Tapping on a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable delivery reports and you can backup text messages to the internal storage memory (and restore them from there later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Explorer boils down to an on-screen custom-made virtual QWERTY keyboard. It won't please heavy texters as it's rather tiny and cramped. The landscape version isn't much bigger either. Still, it's good enough for the occasional text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user-friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Mail app and Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer comes with two email clients ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been updated too. Emails are organized into four tabs and can be sorted by date, sender, subject, priority or size (both ascending and descending). You can browse all folders for the email account or view all inboxes combined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go for the latter option, emails are color-coded so it's easy to tell which email belongs to which account. You can mass delete emails or mark them as read too (you can't perform other operations en masse like you can in Gmail though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the tabs. The first one, Received, contains all the emails. Then comes the Thread tab - it groups related emails into conversations (hit the down arrow to see the list), but once you open an email you can only view them one at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are previous/next buttons in the menu, but it would have been more convenient to view all messages together on the screen (like in the Gmail app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you have a Favorites tab that holds only email from contacts in the Favorites group and an Invite tab that collect invitations from online calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app also supports batch operations - you can mark multiple emails as read/unread or delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Explorer lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic image gallery with Facebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gallery in the HTC Explorer displays a list of thumbnails. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. You can hide certain folders if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the folders, you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Albums app has a second tab, dedicated entirely to photos from your Facebook account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC Explorer is very straightforward ? tap the share button, pick your preferred sharing method and select one or multiple photos/videos to share. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook or Picasa. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no sharing on Twitter by default and there's no DLNA connectivity either (things we're used to from other HTCs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options ? you?d need a proper file manager for that. There are also some basic editing tools too, like cropping, rotating and applying effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Explorer supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 50% with a simple double tap on the screen or continue to pinch zoom until you reach 100%. The implementation here is extra smooth too. And if you pan past the edge of an image, you'll scroll into the next image, which is a handy way to browse multiple photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good enough codec support for the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or through the Videos shortcut. They both bring you to the same place though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over Bluetooth, MMS, email, YouTube or Facebook..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Explorer offers a full screen toggle (stretches the video to the screen's aspect) and you can scrub through videos. There are also sound enhancement options - SRS and 5.1 virtualization. Subtitles are not supported though. DLNA is a no-go too with the Explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player did well enough for the class - sub-HD videos with DivX or XviD codec were generally not a problem, even entire movies. 720p videos wouldn?t play though, nor would MKV files, but given the screen size and resolution and lack of TV-Out, we hardly think this is a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with sound enhancements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player uses a tabbed interface. The tabs group your music collection in different ways - by artist, album, playlist or just all songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs but that worked rather strangely. You can skip between different albums/artists but not individual songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the bottom corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer offers the SRS sound enhancement plus a standard set of equalizer presets when you connect a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on the lockscreen that lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). You can also use the notification area and the Shortcuts &amp; Clock widget to control the music player too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Video player, there's no DLNA support here. Actually, there's no DLNA support at all in the HTC Explorer, which is something to note if you were counting on it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output for the class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its low position in the pecking order, the HTC Explorer did fairly well in our audio quality test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Explorer produces nicely clear output with above average loudness. The scores it achieved are good, save for the only average intermodulation distortion. Frequency response is great for the most part, but the extreme bass frequencies are slightly cut off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that the HTC Explorer was optimized to work with headphones, as its performance in that scenario was pretty decent. Its distortion levels did go up a little and so did stereo crosstalk, but differences really aren't as big as we are used to seeing. In fact we would say the Explorer is among the better performers with headphones we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see how the Explorer did for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fixed-focus 3MP snapper, nice interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer packs a 3MP fixed-focus camera that does stills of up to 2048x1536 pixels. There's no LED flash to go with it, like the Wildfire S had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. The still/video toggle is above the virtual shutter key and the Effects button along with the Gallery shortcut are below it. There's a virtual zoom lever on the left side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging is available as an option with the HTC Explorer. The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's basic face detection which can be used for taking self portraits. You just turn on the option and point the camera at yourself. As soon as the Explorer sees your face, it snaps a photo. The face detection doesn't automatically pick what to focus on as on most phones - remember, there's no autofocus capability here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images snapped with the HTC Explorer are acceptable if you're going to upload them on Facebook where people will view them downscaled to fit their 15-22 inch monitors. Once you zoom in to 100%, you notice all sorts of things wrong with the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, there's a lot of noise that has been oversharpened, which makes things worse. While contrast and exposure are OK, colors are much too dull. And don't count on good macro shots either. Still, this is all par for the course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 3MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first chart, the Explorer does mostly okay, but you can still see the strong oversharpening "halo" and there's a pink spot too. On the next chart (that's not the black and white best-case scenario of the first) you can see the noise more clearly. The third shows decent colors and no tinting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects - Grayscale, Sepia, Negative, Solarize, Posterize and Aqua.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in .MP4 format in VGA resolution (that's 640x480 pixels) at 19 frames per second (well below the 24fps limit), so most of the videos are choppy. The video quality is below average, even for a VGA shooter. We really wouldn't recommend the Explorer's camcorder for anything other than an occasional video to post on Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample VGA@19fps clip (0:10s, 2.5MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity in a tiny package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer has a complete connectivity set. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast tri-band 3G: 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA. The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the HTC Portable Hotspot can support 1 to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to manually switch it off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser does Flash easily<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser with Sense UI 3.5 polish. The screen is fairly small and the small text isn?t very readable, so the Explorer isn?t meant for heavy mobile Internet users. For all others it will suffice though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser goes into full-screen when the web page finishes loading and has very minimalistic UI, which leaves almost the entire screen to the page contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an URL bar at the top of the screen flanked by Back and Refresh keys. Once you zoom in and pan around the page, even that bar disappears. Still, there are plenty of options - you have to press the menu key to reveal them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are home and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like find on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer's browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then the low pixel density makes it illegible) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share via a message or social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. You can tag bookmarks, which is a great way to keep things on order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer has full Flash support, you have to install the player manually though. At first we thought it didn?t work, but a restart was all that was needed. We were pleasantly surprised to see YouTube videos of up to 480p play smoothly. HD videos however prove too much - not surprising, since even the more powerful offerings from HTC have issues with that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out a few Flash games and they worked surprisingly well. You can play the Flash content in full screen and landscape mode, which makes the most out of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag which is the way of the future, now that Adobe has given up on mobile Flash.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good organizer sans Office document viewing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Explorer, but there's no Office document or PDF viewers preloaded. You'll have to turn to the Android Market for that. Still, the rest of the package is as good as we're used to from HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. It's part of the Clock app, which includes several other features. The Desk clock, for example, shows time and weather so you can use the Explorer as a desk clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick lookup is a handy app that lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatted for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market joined by HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market uses several side-scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This layout reminds of the Apple's App Store a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Marked items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your contacts and messages on the Explorer (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Explorer in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, the HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Explorer has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the HTC Explorer was announced our first thought was "Nothing we haven't seen. Next one please" but we admit we were wrong. The 600MHz processor did much better than expected - the chipset is much better than what the Wildfire S had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer particularly impressed us when it handled Flash content with ease - both videos and games. It's good for watching some SD videos and playing some Android 3D games too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the package - both software and hardware - performed adequately as well. The HTC Explorer only disappointed us in two areas - retail box (be sure to bring your own microSD card and headset) and the camera. Still, those things were to be expected in an entry level device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have some alternatives, like the HTC Wildfire S or the old-but-popular LG Optimus One P500. They have similar specs, but their chipsets and software are older then what you'd get with the Explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go down a notch with the Samsung Galaxy Y S5360 or go up to the Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    HTC Wildfire S ? LG Optimus One P500 ? Samsung Galaxy Y S5360 ? Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Sony Ericsson W8 is a cheap entry into Android which, while slightly less capable than the Explorer, does come with a 2GB microSD card and a headset with music controls. The Xperia mini is where you can go for mid-range specs in a compact form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Salsa is also worth a look - bigger screen and a slight advantage in some of the other specs plus deeper Facebook integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a Nokia 500 is a non-Android option with a 1GHz processor, higher res screen (360x640) and free lifetime navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson W8 ? Sony Ericsson Xperia mini ? HTC Salsa ? Nokia 500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to say we quite liked the little HTC Explorer - it managed to prove the pessimists in us wrong more often than not. The software especially was on a midrange level, which we really appreciated, and the hardware has its charms. While the Explorer will never be a star, it's a smart buy for a first time smartphone user or a young geek.</paragraph>
