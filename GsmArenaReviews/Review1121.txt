			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei pulled the wraps off its next flagship in London in early April. London streets and buildings were the perfect backdrop for black-and-white photography and everything looked extra special through the P9's secondary black-and-white lens. But there is more to the P9 than just the duo of cameras. The P9 is a proper high-end device with the premium feel and build quality to go with it so after a short hands-on, we were more than eager to get started working on a full review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in the day, the Huawei Ascend P6 was the first real push of Huawei towards the high-end market spectrum. It was notable for its super-slim design, metal frame, and beautiful panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P7 improved on the design and hardware, while the P8 after it offered great night photography and selfie pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today, the P9 makes a big step ahead, opening the door to a new photography genre for mobile photographers and bringing along a bunch of nice shooting modes, faster hardware, and an even better design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 has a mid-sized 5.2" IPS 1080p display. It runs on the latest Kirin 955 chipset with 3GB of RAM, and comes with a plethora of connectivity options, and a beefy 3,000 mAh battery. But its key selling points are the exquisite design and exceptional photography skills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9 comes with a duo of 12MP snappers co-designed with Leica - a regular 12MP sensor is joined by a second monochrome 12MP sensor - both with Leica optics and featuring hybrid auto-focus, which combines laser, depth, and contrast detection. On board, we also find Leica-exclusive color modes and a real-time shallow depth of field effect, among many others. And if you are into selfies, then the front 8MP camera will probably not disappoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And this is just the beginning. You can get the P9 with ceramic white finish, or brushed aerospace-class aluminum and each of those is as appealing as a piece of art. Interested already?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei P9 lacks three things the P9 Plus builds upon - the bigger 3D Touch-enabled screen, an AMOLED panel, and an AF 8MP snapper with f/1.9 aperture. Those three account for the ?100 price gap. But both devices lack 4K video recording, which is not cool for one of the coolest flagships around. We don't know if it's a GPU thing or Huawei just can't do 4K capturing yet. But we really wish this wasn't the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen resolution is also not class-leading but Huawei seems to stick to 1080p even for its priciest devices. Since Huawei is more than eager to compare the P9 to the iPhone 6s, we guess 1080p would suffice. However in Android world, these days flagship phones are expected to come with 1440px QHD screens so that's another competitive setback to keep in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Huawei P9 has more than enough to make it worthy of its flagship status, and we can't wait to explore it in detail. Our traditional hardware inspection kicks off right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Huawei P9<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The P9 box is rather big, but houses just the necessities - a 5V/2A wall plug, a USB Type-C cable, and a pair of EarPod-like headphones with a remote. We appreciate the nice packaging - it surely feels premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to rapid (quick) charge your battery, you will have to purchase Huawei's original Quick Charger 9V/2A for about $20.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P9 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei P9 spreads at 145 x 70.9 x 7 mm, which is about the same as the P8, or rather 1.3 mm narrower to be more precise. The P9 weighs the same as the P8 at 144g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei has upped the attention to detail to a new high with the P9 flagship. There are two flavors of the P9 - the ceramic white, and the metal one made of aerospace-class aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ceramic white edition, obviously, has a ceramic unibody, which is highly glossy but far from slippery. The white flavor is not prone to fingerprints and smudges, but that's not the best part of it. Huawei claims the ceramic is "smoother than the painted bodywork of premium cars." It bends light to create an ever-changing show of color as ambient light changes and we can confirm the effect is nothing short of stunning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we handled the ceramic version only at the announcement event and we can't show you any pictures for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another flavor, made of brushed hairline aluminum, only available in Haze Gold paintjob. It has a very similar feel of the HTC One M9, which was also made of brushed aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we have the aluminum model with sandblast finish, Titanium Grey paintjob, and it's equally beautiful. The other available color options for the sandblasted models are Prestige Gold, Rose Gold, and Mystic Silver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, our Huawei P9 is clothed in 2.5D glass and aerospace-class aluminum. The industrial design is continuation of the P-series while its sandblasted finish makes for a rather premium matte look, secure grip, and is very pleasant to touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal frame is part of the chassis but is accented with chamfered edges all the way on both sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have probably noticed the two plastic strips on the back - currently that's the solution to cover the antenna bands, and the P9 has three of those (antennas not strips) to make sure death grips never happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top plastic strip is rather insignificant though, as it is mostly hidden under the luxurious camera plating. For the titanium gray model, the panel is made of black glass with discreet gray line pattern. It's an excellent accent on the dual 12MP snappers and the Leica logo sits great on the opposite side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is one of the most beautiful smartphones we've handled lately, and is a pleasure to work and shoot with. It's slim and lightweight but of a sturdy and solid build, and thanks to the sandblasted finish the grip is very secure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the P9 is compact enough and easy to operate with just one hand. Your index finger should fall perfectly on the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. The sensor is always-on and unlocks the P9 immediately upon touch, no need to wake it up first. It's rated as Level 4 of fingerprint recognition security, which makes it one of the most secure scanners available on a phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.2" display is the earpiece which has an embedded notification light underneath and you can see it only when active. The 8MP selfie shooter and a couple of sensors are also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing but the Huawei logo below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side has the SIM/SD tray which requires a small pin to pop out. It could either house a nano-SIM and a microSD card, or two nano-SIM cards if you got the dual-SIM P9 flavor. This model uses a hybrid slot, so you can choose to either have a microSD or a second SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal volume rocker and power/lock key are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone has nothing but the secondary mic. The bottom is pretty crowded though - here are the USB Type-C port, the loudspeaker grille, the primary mic, and the audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 features two 12MP sensors on the back, one is fairly standard and captures color photographs while the other is monochrome (black&amp;white). Leica designed three modes - Standard, Vivid Colors and Smooth Color, which promise to recreate the Leica film camera experience. We'll talk about this later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera setup is completed with a dual-tone LED flash and the laser AF hidden beneath.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5.2" IPS-NEO display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 may be all about the Leica camera, but it also has a very promising and flagship-worthy display. Arguably, 1080p is a bit outdated, but the 423ppi is more than enough for achieving an excellent mark in pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 uses an IPS-NEO LCD panel by JDI, which delivers deep blacks. The Huawei P8 was perhaps the first phone we've seen to come with this tech but today, it no longer looks as spectacular as before. Don't get us wrong, it's still noticeably better than any regular IPS LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei promised us a maximum brightness of 500 nits for the P9 and we measured exactly 500 nits. While the IPS NEO screen offers some deep blacks, we've surely seen better. The contrast is very good, but not impressive at 1094:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regarding color reproduction accuracy, the P9 screen is less than stellar with an average deviation (DeltaE) of 6.7 - a bit higher than what we would ideally like. We've seen worse even in flagship devices, so this one sits somewhere in the middle. For a screen to be considered properly calibrated it needs to have a maximum DeltaE of 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the built-in Color temperature modes, we managed to get a better color reproduction by going with the Warm one (Avg. DeltaE 6.1), but that came at the expense of slightly lower maximum brightness (450nits). The Warm option fixed the bluish white color, which was the one top drag the Maximum DeltaE up to 12.8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9's solid performance in our display tests continues into sunlight legibility. A score of 3.195 is a very good achievement for an LCD panel and emphasizes another strong point of the IPS NEO tech.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is powered by a beefy 3,000 mAh battery, sealed as expected. The P9 supports the so-called rapid charging with a 9V/2A charger, which fills about 40% of the battery in 30 minutes. The phone ships with a regular 5V/2A plug though, so if you want rapid charging, you'll have to buy the 9V charger separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our battery test and the Huawei P9 scored a 75h rating, which means you can count on the battery to last just few hours north of 3 days if you do an hour each of calling, browsing the web and video playback a day. Such usage pattern may be somewhat artificial, but we've established it, so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9 posted very balanced battery life on all tests. Standby battery life was gauged in the Performance mode, which does not put any limits on the hardware. The Standard mode will add a couple of hours to the rating, while the Ultra Power Saving will keep your phone alive for quite some time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the so-called ROG power-saving, which lowers the native resolution down to 720p and will give you more battery life when playing games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Regarding connectivity, the Huawei P9 is properly equipped. Huawei is very proud, and rightfully so, of the Kirin 955's built-in radio support, which includes up to four 2G bands, seven 3G bands, and eighteen 4G bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our variant (EVA-L09) comes with a single nano-SIM slot, but you can opt for the dual-SM flavor (EVA-L29) with a hybrid secondary nanoSIM/microSD slot. Its second card can only tap into 2G networks while the first gets the full cellular connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9 supports dual-band 2.4/5.0GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, with Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot capabilities. Bluetooth is v4.2, where interference issues with LTE networks should be fixed. There's NFC on board, but only on the single-SIM EVA-L09 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The satellite receiver GPS, GLONASS, and Beidou, so there isn't a corner in the world where the smartphone won't be able to pinpoint your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no FM radio though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm jack provides standard connectivity for wired headphones. There is the new USB Type-C connector for charging and wired connectivity. Mind you, it defaults to charge-only every single time you connect it to a PC, and you have to select manually from the notification shade that you want to do something else.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Emotional Marshmallow to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, skinned with Huawei's own Emotion UI, in its v.4.1 iteration. Emotion UI has been pretty consistent between versions and recurring Huawei users should feel right at home if upgrading to the P9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of stuff going on the lockscreen, starting with the alternating cover images - every time you wake up the device, you're greeted by a different wallpaper. That's if you opt for some of the Magazine unlock styles. You can also go old-school and pick a single image set to be shown on the lockscreen. Whatever you choose, you likely won't be seeing much of it, as the fingerprint unlock will take you straight to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do decide to wake up the P9 via the power button, you get a large clock with a date, steps counter (if enabled) and a shortcut to the camera. You can also quickly start the camera by a double press of the Volume Down button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the lockscreen, you can pull up an iOS-style menu from the bottom, where you get yet another camera shortcut, but also quick access to the flashlight, calculator and voice recorder. If you've chosen the magazine style lockscreen, the pull-up menu will give you eight more options for control over the changing covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with any number of customizable shortcuts between 0 and 5, which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are eighteen homescreen panes at most, more than enough to house all of your apps since there is no app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Widgets are available too - it's mostly the stock Android ones, but Huawei has thrown in some of its own as well. If you like your homescreens neatly organized, you can enable the shake feature, which will arrange scattered apps starting from the top left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Theme options are available in the Emotion 4.1 UX. They can swap your wallpapers, icon pack, and lockscreen style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two panes - one that holds all notifications sorted in a timeline, and another for all of your quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9's task switcher lets you swipe up and away unwanted apps. A downward swipe locks the app so that when you hit the Kill all button, it remains open. That's nifty if you are trying to free some RAM for a particular app or game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For certain scenarios, like in-car use, you can enable a Simple homescreen mode, which features large tiles for easy tapping. It's not particularly consistent, though, offering simple version of some menus, but not others - the dialler is the same size as in regular mode (in all fairness it's fairly oversized to begin with).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei had granular control over app permissions before it was cool, and there's no reason to change that, now that the feature comes as a part of latest Android Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9 features a notification center, courtesy of the Phone Manager app, from which you can control which apps can send you the three types of available notifications - the shade notifications, the lockscreen notifications and the banner style notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This level of control is also employed when it comes to the app access to network data. The user can control the rights of each application to access either WiFi or mobile data. This can save a lot of traffic and help you optimize your data plan and consumption in an easy and convenient way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone Manager also features harassment filter, battery manager with power-saving modes, and options to choose which apps to run in the background and which not (protected apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of the extensive Smart assistance package, you can customize the bottom navigation bar - you can swap the task-switcher and back keys, or even add a shortcut for the notification area. There is also a one-handed UI mode, for easier menu surfing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable the so-called Floating dock - it's a virtual key you can move anywhere on the screen, allowing you to expand it to the primary Android keys - Back, Home, Task Switcher, Lock and Close all running apps. It will help you control your phone with just one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motion control also plays a significant role on the Huawei P9. There are flip gestures, as well as picking up, tilting and even things like knuckle detection and drawing. All of those are extensively customizable to your liking as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One handed-more is available, as well as scheduled power on and off. The Smart Assistance package also offers Glove mode, and an option to prevent accidental unlocks while the P9 is in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice control, on the other hand, lets you operate the P9 entirely hands-free. The functionality resembles what we have seen on certain Nexus and Samsung Galaxy devices and boils down to the ability to trigger a voice command, even when the phone is locked, and its screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei does this by always listening for a "trigger word", which by default is... "Okay, Emy." Once triggered, the phone wakes up and awaits further voice instructions, like placing a call. Speech awareness is also customizable. The wake-up phrase can be changed, and you can also train the device to recognize your voice better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's fingerprint recognition has long been among the best available, and that's only gotten better on the P9. The sensor is always on, and it will unlock the smartphone and take you to the homescreen in what can be described only as a 'mere instant'. The lightning fast unlock comes along with a new Level-4 3D figerprint detection technology ranking it among the most secure mobile phone readers on the market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is powered by an in-house Kirin 955 chipset. The model number doesn't suggest a big change compared to the Kirin 950 inside the Mate 8, and that's indeed the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kirin 955 SoC features an octa-core CPU with four Cortex-A72 cores clocked at up to 2.5GHz (compared to the 2.3GHz of the Kirin 950's), and four Cortex-A53 cores ticking at up to 1.8GHz (same as Kirin 950). The GPU is again a quad-core Mali-T880 MP4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We kicked off our benchmark routine with the GeekBench CPU test. The performance of a single Cortex-A72 core is rather uninspiring compared to the Snapdragon 820's Kryo within the Xiaomi Mi 5 and the LG G5, nor does it come close to the Apple's Twister CPU.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core test is where the Kirin 955's CPU shines - thanks to the higher processor clock it does better than the Huawei Mate 8 and bested every other smartphone we've tested so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound AnTuTu 6 test gives the P9 some edge over its Mate 8 predecessor, but trails behind the current crop of flagships. That's probably due to the lower-grade GPU, but we'll talk about that in a minute.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark OS 2.0 test paints a slightly different picture, because in addition to CPU, GPU, RAM, and UX, it also gauges web and storage performance, plus overall OS behavior. Here the Huawei P9 scored an excellent mark and is on par with the LG G5 and the Galaxy S7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the graphics department where Kirins are often not quite up to par, and seeing that nothing's changed over the Mate 8 in this respect, benchmark results are very much the same. While the Kirin 955, same as Helio X25, uses Mali-T880 MP4 (quad-core) graphics, the flagship Galaxy S7's Exynos utilizes Mali-T880 MP12 (12-core graphics), hence the big difference. Qualcomm's Adreno 530 within he Mi 5 and G5 is the best, though.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Car scene (offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei P9 runs on 1080p resolution, which gives it an edge over the Quad HD LG G5 and Samsung Galaxy S7, which cuts the gap short and makes more sense for Huawei not to opt for the best GPU on the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>BaseMark X GPU test clearly shows the superiority of Galaxy S7, LG G5, and Xiaomi Mi 5. BaseMark ES.3.1 gives us pretty much the same results.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it all up, the Kirin 955 brings a marginal improvement in performance over the Mate 8's Kirin 950. The flagship chips from Qualcomm and Samsung will remain undisturbed at the top for the time being.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Huawei P9 packs top-notch CPU punch and enough GPU power for its 1080p display. While its GPU performance may not be the best in class, there isn't a single game the P9 can't handle right now. And it offers a ROG power-saving mode that lowers the screen resolution down to 720p, which will not only save you some battery, but allow for a higher framerates if needed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 handles voice calls with ease and sound quality doesn't disappoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9's stock dialer app is a trinity of tabs bundled together - these include the Dialer, Contacts, and Favorites. The phonebook offers all the usual sorting and display options, it supports multiple accounts, and there are lots of fields available for each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 scored a Good mark in our standardized loudspeaker test. Our impressions from the speaker's sound quality are mostly positive - it produces deep and rich sound, but the default ringtones are rather quiet and you may miss some calls. Perhaps you can load a ringtone of your choosing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The P9 ships with WPS office, which can be used for some basic document editing on the go. It can handle text documents, spreadsheets and presentations as well as PDF files. It can also export to PDF.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone Manager is Huawei's do-it-all app for keeping control over your phone. It lets you control all sorts of features from call/message privacy and Do Not Disturb settings, to phone optimization and app permissions, to network and battery usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app features a one-touch optimization feature that frees up memory space and gives you settings recommendations for maximum battery performance. It's a hell of a slick feature that few manufacturers offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery Manager is part of Phone Manager and includes a selection of three power plans with varying degrees of feature limitations. From here you can also control which apps can remain active after you send the phone to sleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has bundled the P9 with its Health app, which tracks steps and calculates calories burnt, but can also supposedly count the number of floors you've climbed. A file manager is also present, and it supports batch actions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Simple gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9's gallery app offers a Timeline view, which sorts your images by the date you've taken them. Alternatively, you can opt for the standard Album view with all of your images sorted in different albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options (including streaming it over DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The info icon up top gives some pretty detailed information about the image, including a histogram. Pulling down from anywhere on the screen lets you take a quick photo without leaving the gallery. The image comes out in a square 1:1 ratio at 2,976 x 2,976.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements. You can adjust levels and add individual watermarks for time, location, weather, food and mood.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to playing videos, the Huawei P9 default player is pretty basic. Its sole option is playback speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 comes with Huawei's custom music player app. It offers four default playlists - songs, artists, albums, folders. You can create your playlists, too. The background of the app changes dynamically to match the album art, which is a nice little touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics. There are no equalizers to speak off, but the app does have a few extra features. It would try to pull album art, song info and lyrics automatically for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 lacks FM radio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio clarity is decent, loudness disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When used with an active external amplifier the Huawei P9 delivered perfectly clean output, which is par for the course for any flagship these days. The volume levels are lower than average though, which means it can?t quite keep up with its rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo crosstalk worsens by a moderate amount when you hook a pair of headphones, but the overall output is still satisfyingly clean. Loudness dropped even further though, so it?s certainly not a performance worth writing home about. It will probably do for people who haven?t invested in large high-impendance headphones, but demanding audiophiles certainly have better options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual 12MP camera co-developed with Leica<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is where this review gets even more interesting - the Huawei P9 camera is loaded with innovation - it was co-designed with Leica and the renowned camera maker helped create something unique.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 features two 12MP sensors, one is fairly standard and captures color photographs while the other is only monochrome (black &amp; white). The latter lacks a Bayer filter which is used in color cameras. This has enabled the monochrome sensor to capture (up to 3x) more light and so it should fare better in low-light photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leica also designed three shooting (film) modes for the color sensor - Standard, Vivid Colors and Smooth Color, which promise to recreate the Leica film camera experience (you even get a Leica shutter sound). The Standard one is, well, the regular color mode: Vivid dials up the colors; while Smooth is somewhere in between. The camera samples explain these best:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides these three special color modes, the P9 can also shoot in monochrome. This is true monochrome too, not just desaturated color photos like all other smartphones shoot. The captured detail is amazing, as is the dynamic range. We were impressed with these samples and with the right subject (of which London had plenty), the 12MP monochrome camera can take some amazing shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Vivid and Smooth modes play with the color saturation a lot - the Vivid boosts all colors, while the Smooth option is a bit gentler. You can use those modes while shooting panoramic shots or capturing videos, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best idea to illustrate the difference is to show you some samples. While the Vivid and Smooth modes distort the colors, and often increase the contrast thus lowering the dynamic range, they can potentially bring life quite a few otherwise darb pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is another scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This second camera is used for more than just the occasional dramatic B&amp;W shot, though. It has superior low-light performance, as the lack of an RGB filter on top of the sensor has allowed for a F-stop or more worth of extra light to be captured for the same scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the two sensors allow the the distance to the subjects to be caluclated precisely, which is part of Huawei's Hybrid autofocus (which also includes Laser AF). And since the camera creates a depth map of the scene anyway, it can also leverage this information to recreate a high-quality optical background defocus effect (bokeh).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is the first to offer a live bokeh preview (usually, phones render it after the fact, which takes a few seconds). You can even change the focus point after the fact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei camera app offers manual mode, which has RAW shooting, manual focus, shutter speed and ISO and a few other options. The Pro camera interface is very comfortable, but only if you know how to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no marks to suggest that, but all the camera options are hidden in menus you can bring by swiping up or down from the screen (assuming you hold the camera in landscape mode). This may be confusing at first but you quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu houses all the available shooting modes - Photo, Monochrome, HDR, Panorama, Beauty, and Light Painting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more confusing at first, the Light Painting mode has four additional sub-modes - tail light trails, light graffiti, silky water, star track. Whatever the scene, your P9 will first take a picture with the proper exposure settings and then it will capture the light trails of either cars, stars, water or other moving objects. After you finish capturing those, the light trails will be automatically added to your picture. This process produces some stunning results as long as you keep the camera perfectly still while shooting - on a tripod or similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Night Shot is a long exposure shot (up to 30s) taken at 8MP resolution. It requires a support just like you would with a normal digicam. The amazing thing is that the phone shows you a live preview how the exposure changes with every passing second. You can stop the process anytime when you decide you've captured enough light trails, or light from the buildings in front of you. It's really easy and requires no additional photographic knowledge or tweaking of manual settings - it's just frame your shot on support, start shooting, and then stop shooting as soon as you're satisfied with your photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can snap low-light photos with the monochrome camera, too, though her you need to tweak the manual settings to get it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you are not using the dedicated low-light modes, you can still capture some great shots with the auto mode. Check those dusk samples we snapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit Huawei offers one of the best low-light photography skills on its flagship phones since the P8 and it's one of those camera we'd pick for low-light shots in a heartbeat. While confusing at first, Huawei's take on the interface and capturing process is amog most intuitive and user-friendly we've tried so far.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei P9 uses two 12MP Sony IMX286 sensors, the monochrome one lacks a Bayer filter, which is a normal part of any modern camera sensor. The image quality produced by both sensors is theoretically the same, though the absence of the color filter and thus the brighter sensor gives the monochrome pictures an edge over the color ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we saw the balck&amp;white samples are quite impressive, now it's time to see what the color snapper can do. And it doesn't disappoint at all. The 12MP color samples came out with more than enough resolved detail, high dynamic range, and spot-on colors. The contrast is great, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the iPhone's 12MP images, the P9's could have benefitted from a little more detail and little less noise, but they still tick all the necessary boxes to be considered flagship grade. And thanks to the high dynamic range we found it unnecessary to use the HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come two HDR samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are the rest of the Vivid and Smooth shots we captured.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama mode is one of the better implementations on the market, switching automatically between portrait and landscape. When shooting in portrait, panoramic images turn out a bit taller than 3,000 pixels and the samples below are more than 22MP, while being far from a 180-degree sweep (about 30MP). Stitching is good, exposure is even, it's just that the captured detail is a notch less than on the still images. You can enable Vivid or Smooth modes for the Panorama mode, if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera of the P9 is an 8MP unit shooting images at 3,264 x 2,448 pixels. It's paired with a relatively dim by today's standards f/2.4 lens. There is the obligatory beautification feature, which attempts to mask skin blemishes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go for a regular photo, the resolved detail is quite satisfactory, the colors and contrast are great, too. It's one of the better selfie snappers we've met, it also supports screen flash and shoot pleasant selfies most of the time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording capped at 1080p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the major flaws of the P9 is that it doesn't support 2160p video recording, when it has become the de facto standard resolution for high-end smartphone camcorders. A lot of users will live just fine without it, but they shouldn't have to at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone does support 1080p@60fps, so at least, there's that. Additionally, you get a slow motion mode, where video is recorded at 120fps, but the resolution is just 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p@60fps videos come out with a bitrate of 34Mbps while the 30fps ones are exactly half that. In either case, audio is recorded in stereo at 192kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't much room for praise in the video department. They lack the detail you'd expect from that resolution and the dynamic range is mediocre. The colors are once again spot-on and the contrast is very good. There isn't any annoying focus hunting either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that you can have the Vivid and Smooth modes in videos, too. It's a pity you can't use the monochrome snapper for capturing videos though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first playlist shows Standard, Vivid, and Smooth videos captured by the Huawei P9 mounted on a tripod.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This second playlist is of handheld videos we shot around London.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 60fps video clip.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As usual, we've provided unedited samples straight out of the camera for you to download (1080p@30fps (10s, 23MB), 1080p@60fps (12s, 54MB)).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P9 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Excellent build quality and handling; the sleek design is among the best on the market. Sandblasted, brushed, or ceramic - they are all premium. The compact and lightweight chassis seals the deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is very good with a maximum brightness of 500 nits and 1094:1 contrast. The sunlight legibility is great for an IPS unit and way above the average. The color accuracy rendition could have been better, though, but opting for the warm mode improves it a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is very good at 75 hours and the P9 did well across all test, but managed to impress us with its standby endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Marshmallow with Emotion UI UX is a powerful combo. Huawei has done well to keep the bloatware in check, but left enough in terms of customization options and proprietary services to enhance your Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kirin 955 chipset offers stellar CPU performance but mediocre graphics power. It runs cool for most of the time. While the GPU raw performance is uninspiring, it will still run all class-leading games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got decent audio quality through the audio jack, but low volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best camera setups on the market - the monochrome images are great, as are the regular color ones, no matter if you use some of the special Leica film modes or not. The dynamic range is high, the colors are spot on, the resolved detail is more than enough. The AF is fast and always right while the low-light photography skills can't be matched by any competitor. The panoramic images are very pleasant, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP selfies are very good with enough detail and accurate colors. The screen flash helps, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no 4K video capturing, and the 1080p videos are uninspiring - there is not enough detail, and the samples look like they have been upscaled from 720p resolution. If it's any consolation, the digital stabilization works quite well, and the color rendition and the audio recording are very good. You can even use the Leica film modes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 isn't an all-rounder, and this should have become clear by now. Instead of being a collective of all the latest technology, the P9 focuses on a few key features and excels in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First - it's the exceptional design. Regardless whether you go for the ceramic P9, the brushed aluminum version, or the sandblasted aluminum version - the Huawei P9 feels like a piece of jewelry in hand. You can see and feel its premium chassis, which also shines with sleek profile and compact form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is the Leica camera setup. The monochrome camera was a risky move, but it looks like it will pay out. The B&amp;W samples turned out great while the regular ones are nothing short of flagship-worthy. Finally, the low-light photography skills are so rich that we are still researching all the available modes and options. Huawei has a unique way to handle the so-called Light Paintings, and you can do some jaw-dropping shots as long as you have a tripod.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the P9 continues the improvement of its Emotion UI, on top of the latest Android Marshmallow. The launcher is very intuitive and easy to use, but it has lots of tweaks and customizations settings that will please everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company likes to focus on the user experience, and that's why the P9 has one of the fastest and most accurate fingerprint readers, one of the best IPS displays out there, and a very good battery life. Even the loudspeaker and audio quality performance are doing very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we are back to the beginning - the Huawei P9 isn't the perfect flagship, it isn't an all-rounder. It fails to deliver a punch in the graphics performance test, and it can't even record good 1080p videos, let alone 4K ones. But that's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we've already established, the Huawei P9 is far from being perfect. But it has an edge over the competition with the Leica camera setup, and that should count for something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 has the looks, offers better performance, and water-proofing. The camera is excellent, too, but the low-light skills aren't as good, and you can't have those dramatic B&amp;W pictures. It's the best-selling flagship this season and is worth checking out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same goes for the LG G5 - innovative modular design, top-notch performance, but can't match the P9 looks. What it can do is offer another take on the dual camera setup with a super-wide secondary camera sensor for some panorama-grade pictures. Note, however, that the G5 is about ?150 more expensive than the P9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi 5 is yet another great performer to match the P9 flagship status and offers equally beautiful looks on the cheap. Its camera is mainstream, but is OIS-enabled, and the MIUI is a fan-favorite launcher. The Mi 5 also outed one of the best battery scores we've seen to date, so there is that. It's limited availability, and the even more limited ceramic version is a deal-breaker though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16GB iPhone 6s costs as much as the Huawei P9. It has the looks and the performance skills, but can't match the camera performance, the bigger screen or the expandable storage. You can have the 64GB iPhone SE for the same cash too - it may be smaller than P9, but offers blazing-fast performance and 4K video capturing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2015 flagships - the Galaxy S6 edge and the Xperia Z5 are still among the best performers on the market, they go for less and may turn out the better choice if video recording or water protection come before the camera quality for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, for some extra ?150 you can upgrade to the Huawei P9 Plus with a bigger AMOLED screen, 3D Force Touch display, double the storage, and a beefier battery. If you want to save ?150 off the P9 price, and you are ready to give up on the Leica camera - there is the Huawei P9 Lite for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Huawei P9 the photography geeks will rejoice while the rest may find a stunning looker they must have. The Huawei P9 may not be the fastest smartphone around, but it is so many other things. It's beautiful and snappy, it's a skilled photographer, it's got a great screen, rich software features and customizations, and it's also got expandable storage. The competition has a lot to offer, too, but so does the P9. A more palatable pricetag would certainly help its case as well.</paragraph>
