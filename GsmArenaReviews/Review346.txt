			<paragraph>Samsung U700, a.k.a Samsung Ultra 12.1, is one of the four slim models in the Ultra Edition II Series. The number indication 12.1 refers to the body thickness in millimeters. The U700 model is the slimmest slider ever to support high-speed data transfers over HSDPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung U700 or Ultra 12.1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we start our review, one fact cannot go unmentioned: Samsung altered the original design of Samsung U700 at some point between the official announcement and the actual market launch - an unusual move, indeed. The phone we explored at this year's 3GSM congress had a dark-colored body and a completely different keypad. Ultimately, the overall design of the body remained untouched, but black became silver, the keypad went completely the other way, and the display was covered with shiny glass.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tempting splendor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One should be careful labeling the Samsung U700 a fashion phone, given its rich functionality and remarkable options. Yet, as it usually happens, its design will be the first thing to grab the attention. The model we tested proved a real eye-catcher wherever we went. If you think the pictures in this review manage to convey the beauty of the Samsung U700, be warned that in reality, the phone looks even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung U700 looks spectacular even though it's all made of plastic </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U700 owes its smart and elegant looks to a combination of a number of important elements: sliding construction, slim and solid body and glossy finish. In addition, to follow suit with the design features of the phone's front panel, Samsung has replaced the standard mechanical buttons with touch-sensitive keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let us now stop singing praises of the new Samsung beauty and put it to our keen and ruthless scrutiny. Samsung U700 looks great and feels solid and comfortable to handle. The constructional work is worth the highest praise. The sliding mechanism works reliably; no creaky sounds can be heard. When the phone is opened, its both parts hold together as if they are a monolith piece. When closed, however, it does show an insignificant unsteadiness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The body of the phone with the sliding mechanism demonstrate perfect constructional work</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To slide the phone open you'll only need to push halfway; the rest is taken care of by a spring mechanism. There is no jut to push and slide; instead, your finger inevitably slides down the area of the round navigation key leaving unpleasant prints. By the way, fingerprints will always cause a grumble. The front plate is made of glossy mirror-like material, which elegantly encloses the navigation key to reach the top of the phone. The sides look polished chromium. The only matt area is the dark silver back plate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Loudspeaker and video-call camera at the top of the mirror-like plate</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung chose to use plastic materials but managed to achieve exclusivity in the stylish design. The main shortfall, as in all other glossy-surfaced phones, is the inevitable fingerprints.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scroll of the ring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most attractive part of Samsung U700, when closed, is the round navigation key beneath the display. There's both an aesthetic and practical function behind the choice of shape. The navigation key can be scrolled both ways notably easing the browsing of phonebook, messages or Internet websites. There's a four-directional press too. The center of the navigation key confirms selected options; when pressed, it gently sinks beneath the ring level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The four-way navigation key with a confirming center can even be scrolled both ways</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A surprise lies in stock for the unsuspecting user. On the sides of the navigation key, the essential red and green receivers are placed. Yet, Samsung, inspired by the recent boom of touch-sensitive keys, has hidden no less than four keys under the hood. These are marked by pictograms of video call, application switch plus two context keys and appear illuminated in white as soon as the keypad is unlocked (to unlock the keypad use the center key). "Application switch" is kind of misleading, though. Samsung U700 does not feature real multitasking and the key can only switch to only three available applications - Calls, Messages, and Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes longer to get accustomed to the touch-sensitive keys. Successful "presses" are acknowledged by a twinkle of the backlight of the respective key. The touch-sensitive keys react to the touch of fingers, as skin is a perfect electricity conductor. A key will not respond to the touch of a rubber, for example. The keys are automatically locked during a call, to prevent the user from unintentionally hanging up by simply touching the phone panel with a cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U700 offers a secondary camera for video calls. The lens is located above the display. Right next to it is the curved etching of the loudspeaker. The top side of the phone only holds the switch on/off button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well-sized and comfortable keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A combined port for charging, data cable and headphones is situated under a plastic cap at the bottom part of the left side. The same side hosts a dual volume-control key, which could have been way more convenient if placed a little higher. In the current setup, the volume control key is easier to reach by middle finger rather than forefinger. That's not all, though. If the headset is plugged into the phone, the volume control keys get fully covered by the odd-shaped connector. On the ri ght side panel is the microSD memory card slot and, a little over it - the camera release button. Shooting with Samsung U700 requires a horizontal orientation of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Right side: slot for microSD cards and release button ? left side: headphones connector or a cable and volume control button&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear panel is less interesting, but we should not forget the thumbs-up to the battery cover for fitting perfectly and causing no creaks. The SIM card is inserted beneath the battery, as usual. When the keypad is slid open, on its back side you will see the lens of a digital camera prepared for self-portraits with a highly powerful LED and a mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;The camera cannot be used unless the phone is open ? the cover hides the battery </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is accessed by sliding the phone open. All 12 keys are covered in plastic. The gridline, that separates the keys, is surprisingly not illuminated, only numbers and letters are. The keypad is illuminated in white with a light violet shade, while the backlighting of the touch-sensitive keys is bright, somewhat greenish, white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Touch-sensitive orientation is not the best, but on the other hand the keys are quite spacious</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys are not fully separated, but are big enough to make typing errors a rarity. Tactile feedback is just right thanks to a special membrane ensuring great typing response. To sum up, the Samsung U700 keypad is one of the most comfortable and practical ever made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;The jut at the bottom of the phone provides for a better grip</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Behind the Mirror<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U700 sports a 262K color TFT display with a QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) resolution. The display offers superb brightness levels, vibrant colors, and good contrast. Nevertheless, these pros get completely lost in twilight, under artificial light or on cloudy days due to the glossiness of the front plate. In bright sun you'll be forced to use your other hand to shade off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stand-by display ? instant application menu ? main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The appearance of the display is fully user-configurable. Service icons provide information on signal strength, network availability of the supported technologies, battery, as well as info about the inserted memory card. Several clock styles are available. You can set a photo or other image as a background, and even use two or more alternating images. The proprietary Samsung uGo feature automatically updates the screen background to display landmarks of the city or country you're in. The scenery even changes when night falls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither the menu, nor the controls (except for the now scroll-enabled navigation key) have undergone any modifications in comparison to previous models. The menu lacks a white theme with black font, which would have been handy in bright days. A surprising addition to the grid menu of 12 icons is the Google item, though its functionality is limited to simple references to the Internet browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample setup options</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>See you when you call!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U700 works in 3G networks with support for video calls. Nonetheless, a major number of your calls will probably be executed in GSM networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has finally adopted ringing profiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is quite good, but a slightly higher volume capacity would have made it even better. The microphone is conveniently placed so the opposite side will surely be enjoying good audio quality. Calls can of course be received with the phone closed, but sound tends to be better when the device is open, which is the preferred option in a loud environment. We're happy with the tests of both the headset included in the retail package and the wireless Bluetooth earphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. It can display the names from the phone memory only or all names from both the phone memory and the SIM card at once. Searching employs gradual typing. Samsung U700 does not search by name and surname separately, unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Phonebook ? group list ? the context menu of the phonebook offers 19 functions</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact context menu may surprise you a bit: it contains a total of 19 entries. A map of the phonebook can be sent via Bluetooth as well as in a message; contacts can be copied from and pasted into the SIM card and even printed via Bluetooth. When a new contact is added the phone prompts the most frequently used fields. If you want to add more details, you'll need to use the contact's context menu. Each contact can be assigned a specific ringtone and picture; contacts can be organized into groups, but calls cannot be filtered on the base of created groups or ringing profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Inserting a new contact ? adding more details </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U700 manages SMS, MMS, and emails. SMS and MMS use one and the same editor. MMS are created through a selection from the menu or by inserting an image, which makes the editor automatically switch from SMS to MMS. SMS can be maximum 2295 characters long; the number you're sending to also counts. The number of the 160-symbol chunks that a longer message breaks down to is shown in the bottom part of the display. T9 editor is there; both browsing and adding new words is fast and intuitive. If sending fails, say because of a network failure, the message is saved to the Outbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message menu ? delivered messages folder ? typing a SMS ? options for creating messages</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is good. It can manage up to 5 accounts; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, meetings, anniversaries, tasks or notes, can be emailed as attachments . The client can be set up to check mail at defined intervals (user-configurable, of course). Chat is available too, but you'll first have to download the Java application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Email client and its options ? memory reserved for messages</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the music play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Entertainment features in the Samsung U700 are worth a closer look. The phone offers a lot of storage space for multimedia thanks to the memory card and can therefore be comfortably used as a music player. The player organizes songs by author or album; playlists can be created too. The minimized player can operate in the background. The phone is sold with a set of headphones, but if you're not happy with them, the additional investment into an adapter should be insignificant. What a pity Samsung changed their mind since the X830 model, which used to be equipped with a universal connector compatible with headsets of all types. The FM radio, which is a quite handy feature, is missing in the U700 equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Music library ? song list ? playing ? playing options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers several ways to download music, of which the easiest and the fastest is the memory card reader. If you do not have such a reader, connect Samsung U700 to a PC through the data cable you get in the retail package. Once connected, the phone will prompt to define the type of connection choosing between the media player profile or the PC Studio 3 application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose the first option, you will initiate the MTP (Media Transfer Protocol), which gets the phone synchronized with the Windows Media Player. The trouble here is that the phone automatically creates lists according to authors' names, which wreaks havoc in the file structure of the card. On the other hand, this type of file transfer is breakneck fast, with a 5MB song transferred in mere 10 seconds. As mentioned above, files can also be copied by using the PC Studio 3, which is described in details in the Samsung D800 review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sweet Macro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U700 features a 3.2 megapixel camera, which can take pictures with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. What's more, it comes with autofocus and a macro mode allowing you to photograph text documents and get creative with your close-ups .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three million pixels and autofocus ready to go once the phone is open</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Camera user-interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sharp enough and little noise - Samsung U700 is a high achiever among photo mobiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Results are good even in low light </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Macro shots come out especially well</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U700 makes great photos in good lighting. During the tests we used the highest resolution and maximum image quality. The fourth sample photo conveys fine details like separate blades of grass, while in the seventh sample photo (a late-afternoon view) areas of similar coloring stand out well and color transition is smooth. All these details speak of fine compression - the great shortfall of so many rival mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera settings ? shooting with a frame</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does not offer manual ISO setup. The photos taken in poorer light do not suffer from excessive noise, but the worse the light conditions, the slower the shutter speed, so the final images are often blurred. Poor lighting isn't suitable for taking closeups as the LED gets the pictures overexposed. The LED is powerful enough to brighten an entire room, but has less impact at longer distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Browsing images in the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is also able to shoot video, recording length is only limited by the free memory. You can shoot pretty long videos because the only available resolution is the rather low QCIF (176 x 144 pixels). Way below today's standards, indeed. We won't be publishing sample video clips taken in QCIF resolution any more - there isn't that much to see really.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>High-speed data transfers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've already mentioned UMTS several times. Yet, Samsung U700 has another ace up its sleeve - HSDPA at the incredible speed of 3.6 Mbps. Even if your operator doesn't support HSDPA yet, owning a Samsung U700 is a guaranteed leap into the future. If HSDPA is still out of the question, you can always count on EDGE and GPRS, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transferred data can be used straight away; Samsung U700 offers a NetFront 3.4 Internet browser, able to resize complicated websites for better usability on smaller display. This feature doesn't always work reliably, though, so text or PDA versions of websites are always preferable. If you can't afford to miss an update, the integrated RSS-feed reader comes handy. You'll be on top of what your favorite websites have to offer, but it may get your data transfers bill soaring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;The standard Internet browser is enhanced with an RSS reader too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving data management to another device, while using the phone as a modem, is also an option. Such transfers can be made via the universal Bluetooth technology or through a data cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Some odds and ends<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's now have a closer look at the rest of the phone menu. The calendar offers three views. In order to preview the events planned for a particular day, you should select the day in question, because the monthly calendar window doesn't show the daily events. Storage restrictions are quite intriguing, the calendar lets you save a limited number of entries of each available type: up to 100 Meetings, 50 Anniversaries and 50 Holidays, 20 "Important" events and 20 "Private notes" . Surely, 100 slots for meetings could hardly ever be used up, but we still consider the calendar limitations rather strange considering the storage capacity of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendar and its options ? alarm clocks</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also offers a personal tasks manager, a voice recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown and a stopwatch will cater to sports-minded users. Samsung U700 supports Java, so downloading additional applications or games is not a problem. The phone features 5 independent alarm clocks, each of which can be assigned a specific melody, volume level, and different active days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;A list with supplementary applications and samples of some of them </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No OS, still true class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U700 is an exquisite slider, likely to easily make most high-priced lifestyle phones suffer an inferiority complex. Not only does it look great, but does an all-round job too. It offers intuitive control and brilliant functions, a high-quality camera, a reasonable music player, instant data transfers via HSDPA, and synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its rich functional equipment lets Samsung U700 stand up to giants like Sony Ericsson K800 or Nokia 7390. If you want a fast mobile without an OS, Samsung U700 is one of the top options in offer today.</paragraph>
