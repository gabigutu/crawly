			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA just couldn't have come to the market at a better time. The Taiwanese company's first smartphone in the United States with a 5" 1080p display is given the tall task of turning its maker's fate around, and bring back the good times at HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The holiday shopping spree has already begun in the United States, so every Android smartphone manufacturer has thrown its best effort on the market. However, the DROID DNA clearly stands out in the crowd with its super powerful quad-core chipset and sweet full HD display. Tuck the aforementioned ingredients into a good looking body and you get a smartphone that every geek should have on their Christmas shortlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All eyes might be focused on the HTC DROID DNA 5" Super LCD3 screen but the smartphone also packs the most powerful chipset in the smartphone game. The tricked out Android 4.1 Jelly Bean is here to bring the user experience another step forward, while the newly designed Beats audio amplifier should help please audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the non-expandable user memory of the latest DROID did cause a few raised eyebrows, while the non-removable 2020mAh battery causes some concern as well - it has four CPU cores and over two million pixels to power. We are now to check out if those actually matter in real life usage or if the DROID DNA is fine as it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will be kicking the review off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection, and a close look at the device's battery performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The HTC DROID DNA is a US-only phone and it will not be making rounds on the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA comes in a relatively small, Verizon branded box. Inside, you will find a charger, a microUSB cable, as well as a small key for removing the microSIM card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA looks a lot like its Japanese relative, the HTC J butterfly. The smartphone is a handsome bloke - it sports clean lines and cool red plus that huge bright screen on the front. The handset's designers have done well with the sides, too - the perforated metal strips are said to be inspired by supercars' design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the smartphone is quite good given the massive screen on board. The HTC DROID DNA stands at 141 x 70.5 x 9.7 mm and while it won't win any slimness awards its footprint is barely any bigger than the Galaxy S III despite the despite packing a 0.2" display. The weight is also quite acceptable at 138 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During the smartphone's announcement, HTC reps were adamant that the device is not going to be marketed as a phablet. The HTC DROID DNA's measures also prove this point - the handset stands much closer to the high end Android smartphones of late, than the Samsung Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is superb. The DROID DNA is made of soft-feel plastic, while its entire front, including the trio of buttons, front facing camera, and sensors, is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 2. There are no nasty gaps to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" Super LCD3 display with full HD resolution is a marvel to look at and the first of its kind to be featured in a smartphone in the United States. With a pixel density of 441ppi, the DROID's screen handily beats all competitors' offerings in terms of sharpness. It simply exceeds the boundaries of human perception - it is impossible to distinguish pixels no matter how good one's vision is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast and sunlight legibility are pretty good too - the display is easy to operate even under direct sunlight. We guess the fact that it is one the brighter screens around helps a lot here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to give you an idea how sharp a screen with pixel density of 441ppi is, we put the HTC DROID DNA display under a macro lens and compared it with the 1280 x 768 pixel display of the LG Optimus G and the WVGA unit of the Nokia Lumia 810.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see above, 5" 1080p display of the latest HTC offering represents a noticeable improvement over what we've seen in the past. The sweetest part of all is that full HD resolution is about to become the standard for top shelf Android smartphones next year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you will find the earpiece, the front-facing camera, as well as the usual set of sensors. The typical for HTC droids trio of buttons can be found below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing on the left side of the DROID. On the right, you will find the lonely volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the device is quite busy. It is home of the power/lock button, microSIM card tray, 3.5mm audio jack, as well as a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port and mouthpiece are located at the bottom. The microUSB port is protected by a small plastic cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera is located at the top of the smartphone's back. It is flanked by an LED flash and a notification light. The loudspeaker grille and the usual set of Verizon and HTC logos are located at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the 2020mAh battery of the device being non-removable, we were quite skeptical about it powering such a powerful hardware and massive screen throughout an entire day. The HTC DROID DNA however, did surprise us pleasantly with its performance in our dedicated battery test. The smartphone managed an endurance rating of 49h, which is more than most of its direct rivals got.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The above rating means that you will need to recharge your smartphone every 49 hours if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must point out once again that the browser part of the battery test has been conducted over a Wi-Fi network. Should you rely solely on Verizon's LTE infrastructure, you can reasonably expect a dip in your device's longevity - the battery went flat after only about 4 hours of LTE browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, HTC enabled wireless charging on the DROID DNA with the Qi protocol, but you'll need to purchase a compatible charger for that to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the HTC DROID DNA was another pleasant surprise to us. The handset was a breeze to operate thanks to being almost as narrow as the HTC One X. The soft-feel plastic also felt assuring and grippy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we give high marks to the HTC DROID DNA for its design and build quality. Display is superb, and battery life is great as long as you have a good Wi-Fi network at your disposal at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the DROID's software, as well as a closer examination of its benchmark performance.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Bean takes over, Sense gets a minor update<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and features the updated version 4+ of the HTC Sense UI. Unfortunately, once you turn on the DROID DNA you'll have to dig deep to find the new Jelly Bean goodies. On the face of it, Project Butter's optimizations and Google Now are all that remind you what version of the OS you are currently running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the UI is pretty much the same, everyone who has already used an ICS-powered HTC droid will feel right at home. Here's a demo video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC is famous for its deep customizations to the interface of the host OS and the latest version of Sense is no exception. Despite Sense 4+ being almost the same as the 4.0 version, it runs a lot smoother because of Project Butter, due in large part to the consistent 60fps of all UI animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen remains unchanged - by default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom, all of which are customizable. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone, or to any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC DROID DNA comes with nine different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu - a photo album, Friend Stream, Weather, Clock, Stocks, Productivity, People, Music or just a plain wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Productivity lockscreen lists the latest missed calls, texts, emails and scheduled events. People lets you pick a group form your phonebook and a rectangular grid of their contact images will pop up on the lockscreen. Grab one of them and drop them on the ring to view their details. You can have more than one page of contacts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music gives you a mini music player on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has an auto-hiding indicator of which screen you're on and a dock with five shortcuts - the middle one is locked to the app drawer, while the other four can be customized as you please (you can even put a folder there, if four shortcuts isn't enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leap view is still here - tap the home key (while on the default homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out (with an awesome animation) to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes. A small house icon indicates the default homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have as many as seven homescreens - and with the excellent set of preloaded widgets (and the huge variety available at the Play store), you might want to keep all of them. In case you don't - you can delete the unneeded ones right from the Leap view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize button is absent from the dock since Ice Cream Sandwich, but you can still find all of its functionality in the Settings or use the dedicated app within the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary Scenes is an essential part of Personalize - essentially five custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, Play and default). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a stock ticker, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course, and you can download and assign new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds, but they're a handy feature if you use your DROID DNA as both work and personal phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of horizontal pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetical, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There are Search and Play Store shortcuts along with a menu for some options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are four tabs available at the bottom - All apps, Frequent and Downloads, as well as a tab dedicated to all the bloatware from Verizon. You can rearrange them or remove Frequent and Downloads if you don't need them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize app also has Sound customizations - you can pick a Sound set or individual ringtone, notification and alarm sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets to the homescreen is done in similar fashion to Honeycomb and is one of the less successful changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You press and hold on the homescreen and everything zooms out so that the homescreen panes are visible as thumbnails on the top row of the screen. You tap a homescreen to select it and then select a widget to add to it (or you can just drag the widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a search option to speed things along or you can choose a widget from the dropdown menu and then select which size you like, but that still feels like an extra step-the old method of picking a widget and then picking the size (if any) seemed simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the top of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area gives you a Settings shortcut here if you need to power something on or off. There's also a Clear button to dismiss all notification or you can swipe them off one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is just one toggle here which is new to the notification area - the Power Saver on/off switch. It does exactly what it's supposed to do - toggles the power saving mode or (if you tap on its name) takes you to the Power Saver options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have remodeled the app switching interface - screenshots are displayed of the running apps, turned slightly to the side. They're ordered horizontally (instead of vertically as is the ICS standard) and you can swipe up to remove them. The not so-good news is that you can only see three of them at a time, even in landscape mode - a waste of screen estate. There's also no way to close all apps with one button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the old task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC DROID DNA benchmark performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We managed our usual set of benchmarks on the HTC DROID DNA and its Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset. We were curious to see how the four Krait cores and the Adreno 320 GPU handle the FullHD screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We started with the BenchmarkPi test, which reflects per-core CPU performance. As expected the Krait architecture helped the DROID DNA beat its quad-core rivals. More impressively, though, it managed to beat the LG Optimus G despite packing identical CPU cores as the LG flagship.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is another CPU-testing benchmark, but it supports multi-threading and thus brings a better idea of the quad-core architecture overall processing power. Here the HTC DROID DNA lost to the Optimus G by a very small margin, but blew the rest of the competitors out of the water.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quadrant benchmark tries to evaluate the overall processing power of the chipset - CPU, GPU and memory performance. The HTC DROID DNA managed to top the competition here, which is a really impressive achievement given that its screen resolution poses a bigger challenge to the graphical power.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA didn't do as well in AnTuTu, which is our other all-round benchmark. The smartphone did beat the LG Optimus G, but came behind the rest of the quad-core top dogs .</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D graphics department is handled by the Adreno 320 GPU. The first test we ran was NenaMark 2, but just like its competitors the HTC DROID DNA managed to hit the 60fps limit of the screen, rendering the results moot. GLBenchmark let us get a better idea of the graphics power of the DROID DNA - the smartphone got the highest score of any smartphone we have tested so far. Given that its screen resolution is much higher than its competitors, though it's can't compete as successfully in on-screen tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA is a stunning performer and while it doesn't have the graphics power advantage to fully compensate for it vastly higher screen resolution that shouldn't be an issue in most of the real-life scenarios.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now helps a lot even when you don't actually use it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we've said, Google Now is one of the most notable new features that the Jelly Bean update brings. In the simplest of terms, it is Android's version of Siri for iOS, but much more integrated into the operating system. Google Now is way quicker than its competitor at recognizing and answering your queries and while its functionality still leaves something to be desired, it seems like a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the HTC DROID DNA gets activated with a press-and-hold of the Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The DROID DNA has HTC's all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it's juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed - you have the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Viewing a contact<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA had no problems with reception and the in-call quality was clear and loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the DROID DNA displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC DROID DNA are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Gtalk, which can connect you to Google's chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. "drx" matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the DROID DNA boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it's still not as good as a hardware one, it's the next best thing - the 5" screen has enough real estate for large, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC DROID DNA lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA uses the in-house HTC gallery, which got a new version within the Jelly Bean. When you open the Gallery you can now choose which photos to view - on your phone, Facebook, Dropbox, SkyDrive, Picasa or Flickr. Wherever you choose you'll get to a familiar screen - stacks of photos arranged by albums. There is a dropdown menu where you can sort the photos by Events a.k.a. the date they were taken. The app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. Some photos have an icon indicating it's not a single photo but a burst shot instead. You can later go back and pick the one to be used as a thumbnail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but you can't copy/paste images across folders - you'd need a proper file manager for that. There are some basic editing tools - crop, rotate and effects (auto enhance, sepia, vintage, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too. Another thing we admire about the HTC gallery is that it displays photos in full resolution, which we believe is a must on a 1080p display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the HTC DROID DNA is built into the Gallery app - there's no dedicated shortcut inside the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface has a view mode toggle (full screen or best fit) and you can scrub through videos. There's a shortcut that lets you adjust screen brightness and another one to take screenshots of videos. Overall the included options are more than enough and they are all implemented in a nice out-of-the-way manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support on the video side is very good - all popular video codecs are onboard and videos run at up to 1080p resolution without a hitch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of audio, you can choose between Beats Audio or No effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support is available and you can manually pick a subtitle file - the only requirement is the subtitle files must be in the video folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too - the DROID DNA can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a large high-res screen like that the HTC DROID DNA makes for a great portable video player - The 1080p clips look downright amazing on the beast and it has enough battery backup for most long travels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem is with just 11GB of user-accessible storage, you can't really upload too much content on this one. High-res movies come with high bitrates and the DROID DNA will run out of space well before it can run out of battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and Beats for all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app starts off by offering you several shortcuts - music library on the phone, SoundHound track recognition, TuneIn Radio or 7digital. Below is a line that shows a recently played song and further down is the currently playing song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the music library available on the phone you get a dropdown menu to browse it by artist, album, playlist or genre. There's a search tool, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist - you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap the ellipsis to automatically fetch album art for a track or look it up on Google or YouTube. From the Menu you get a Select player option, which is how you can play the song on a DLNA-enabled sound system or over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DROID DNA has the Beats Audio moniker stamped on the back, which means your sound is enhanced to boost the sonic experience - you can use it with any headset you want. You can choose between multiple presets - Beats audio, classical, bass boost and so on. HTC finally allow you to turn the effects completely off, which is great news for those of us who are not that bass oriented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the phone doesn't come with a Beats headset it supports several of them - iBeats/urBeats, Beats Solo, Beats Pro or Beats Studio. You should pick the correct one as it adjusts the equalizer according to the characteristics of the headset. There's an "Other" option too, but if you're not using Beats you can just pick the one that sounds best to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows the album art and name of the song and artist along with playback controls. You can drag this card into the ring to unlock the phone and go straight to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and they've even integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The specially designed Beats amplifier of the HTC DROID DNA does a great job and the smartphone produces pretty clean audio output. The DROID DNA has frequency response well within the limits of what is considered excellent and garnishes it with good dynamic range, noise level and stereo crosstalk readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume levels are quite impressive, too, exceeding virtually all smartphones we have tested recently and even matches some of the better tablets out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP still camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 1080p video @ 30fps. There's an LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same for both the still camera and the video camera - no they don't "look alike", the camera just has the UI shared between both functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side features the Effects button, shutter key, camcorder record key and a shortcut to the gallery that shows the last photo taken. On the left is the flash setting toggle, a front camera switch, general settings and shot mode (we'll get back to that in a moment).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To snap a photo, you tap the shutter key. To record video you tap the button below - and you can still tap the shutter key to snap a full-res photo, even while recording video. Another cool option is the burst mode, which we mentioned in the gallery - you press and hold on the shutter key and it will snap multiple photos and let you pick which one to keep (you can keep all of them of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a tab on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There's also some other cool effects such as shallow depth of field , which lets you blur parts of a photo that fall outside a predefined circular area. It's like having Instagram built right into the camera app UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is pretty cool, but we had one problem with this combined interface - if you want full 8MP resolution still shots, you have to disable the Widescreen option. But then it becomes hard to frame a 16:9 video in the 4:3 view finder. That's made even worse when shooting 720p video. The field of view in that mode is narrower than what the viewfinder shows and framing involves a lot of guesswork. We hoped the Jelly Bean update would fix these problems, but that is not the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA has touch focus and face detection; geotagging and smile shutter are also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available too which is good to have on a phone like the DROID DNA with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either, it does burst mode). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have it right is to tap and hold on the spot of the screen where you want the focus to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot mode button offers some more cool stuff - HDR photos, Panorama (with a gyro horizon), portrait, group portrait, landscape, whiteboard, close-up and, finally, low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group portrait is quite cool - we've seen something like it before in the Scalado Rewind. It snaps multiple photos and for each face (and the DROID DNA can track many faces), the phone automatically picks the one where that person is smiling and didn't blink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC DROID DNA features a camera with an f/2.0 aperture and a dedicated image processing chip, just like the HTC One X, so understandably the image quality of the photos produced with the two isn't all that different. The noise levels are moderately high and the resolved detail is good, if unspectacular. The color reproduction seems slightly better on the DROID DNA though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a bunch of samples for you guys below, check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera captures images really fast, thanks to the built-in image processing chip. We also liked the fact that images (by default) don't get in the way - once you've snapped a shot it quietly pops-up in the preview box in the bottom right, without instant preview, and you're free to snap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DROID offers HDR mode too. Here's a comparison of a scene with HDR off and on. The result is okay, but if you don't like the exaggerated HDR look, it might not be your thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC are bragging about the instant photo capture during video recording and we decided to give it a spin. The photos are taken in 16:9 aspect ratio and are in 3264 x 1840 resolution. The idea is that you can snap fast-paced pics while you're recording a video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording is quite good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The DROID DNA records 1080p or 720p videos at 30fps and it can snap photos simultaneously. You can also use touch focus and even toggle the video light - that's during recording!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording turned out to be the better part of the HTC DROID DNA camera performance. The 1080p clip we recorded has a solid 30fps framerate and plenty of fine detail. Colors are pretty accurate too, while noise is kept well under control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Worry-free connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA packs quad-band GSM and quad-band 3G to go with its CDMA/EV-DO talents. Naturally, you have Verizon's superb LTE network is at your service as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no death grip problem we saw haunting HTC devices of old so there's nothing to worry about. Wi-Fi reception is strong, as is the cell signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the DROID DNA with a PC. The long list of options includes PC Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (the phone becomes a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer's Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive have large, easy-to-press icons, which comes in handy since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity with Android Beam is present too. We found it to work hassle free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA comes with an MHL port, so if you plug a MHL dongle in, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection. The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV and with the HD resolution of the display, watching on an HDTV is a joyful experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Even better Jelly Bean browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC DROID DNA comes with the latest version of the Android web browser. Coupled with the Full HD display and powerful processing power of the DROID DNA, the Jelly Bean web browser performs without hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has also thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen, which seemed to pop up when you scroll back to the top of a page, which was getting a bit annoying at times. You see sometime those buttons appeared along with the top bar, whereas on other occasions they remained hidden when the top bar was showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those mysteriously behaving buttons let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs. You might want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu options include a toggle to enable/disable Flash (yes, Flash is supported out of the box within the HTC's implementation of Jelly Bean) and another one to request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Flash support present on the DROID DNA playing Flash videos was a walk in the park. Flash games work like a charm as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA features the usual set of organizer applications. To our surprise however, the device did not have an office app preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock (also part of the Clock app) is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get a stopwatch and a timer in the same app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Note app is also onboard. It is somewhat similar to Samsung's SPen - you can take various notes, add drawings, pictures and dictations. Sharing and printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is HTC Tasks app as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another HTC exclusive app you get is a very basic Movie Editor, which can be used for trimming videos among other things.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no HTC Hub in the Jelly Bean version of HTC's Android implementation. This means you can't get additional HTC scenes, HTC wallpapers, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has ticked all the right boxes with the DROID DNA, creating one of the most attractive offerings currently available on the US market. The combination of the handset's 5" 1080p display and Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro not only guarantees bragging rights, but also really takes the overall user experience to a whole new level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with HTC's latest Sense UI is a great combination as well, providing a great blend of functionality and eye candy. The DROID DNA's camera performance was good if unspectacular, while its build quality is great and should please all but the most demanding users out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much to our surprise, battery life came out pretty good - the powerful chipset and huge high-res screen turning out pretty efficient. We must warn you, though, once you switch to LTE only, making it through a full day becomes a lot more difficult.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came the closest to spoiling the deal for us were the 11GB of user-accessible non-expandable internal storage. The device is a multimedia powerhouse and can show 1080p videos in their native resolution, but it can only fit a couple of movies at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top shelf games for Android easily top 1GB these days and some even exceed 2GB - you can't have too many of those at the same time and given that there's no easy way to retain your saved games you can't simply install just the needed ones every time. What's worse - there's no way to get a version with more storage even if you are willing to pay for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess HTC did this under pressure from Verizon, who wanted to be sure that you will be using the only possible workaround - cloud storage for your multimedia content. And while the carrier will gladly sell you its most expensive LTE plans, even the 4G network isn't always fast enough for those high-quality videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Software is another area of the user experience, damaged by the carrier. Once again, we encountered a massive amount of preloaded, non-removable apps from Verizon Wireless. In fact those same apps help reduce the HTC DROID DNA already limited available storage to the 11GB you get in the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Verizon Wireless has priced the HTC DROID DNA at the highly acceptable $199.99 with a two-year contract. This amount of money will get you arguably the best Android hardware in the United States at the moment, albeit with the above-listed limitation. Should you decide to shop around, here are some more options worth considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like the Jelly Bean/Sense UI combo, you might have a look at the LTE-touting HTC One X+ for AT&amp;T. Costing $199.99, that one comes with 64GB of onboard storage, so it doesn't face the shortages issue of the DROID DNA. The One X+ comes with a chipset of a previous generation though - NVIDIA Tegra 3, and while its screen is great, it doesn't come anywhere near the DROID DNA stunning display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One X+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G for AT&amp;T and Sprint Wireless is another option worth considering. The Korean offerings sport the same chipset as the DROID DNA, while offering more built-in memory. Keep in mind however, that you will need to settle for a lesser display the older, 4.0, Android version. The Optimus G is also priced at $199.99.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Optimus G E970 &#x2022; LG Optimus G LS970</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 is another Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro packing alternative to the HTC DROID DNA. The LG-made device however has the same flaws as the DROD - its battery is non-removable and the user-accessible part of its built-in, non-expandable memory is only slightly larger than that of the HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you get in return though is the cleaner look of stock Android, a newer Jelly Bean version out of the box and guaranteed quick updates whenever a new version of the Google OS comes around. The Nexus 4 costs $199.99 with a two-year commitment to T-Mobile, which doesn't sound like a great bargain, considering that you will be giving up on a 1080p screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if you don't feel like signing a contract, things look dramatically different - the 16GB version of the Nexus 4 costs just $349 SIM-free, which is a lot lower than its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, power users should probably check out the Samsung Galaxy Note II. Yes, its Super AMOLED screen is nowhere near as sharp as the one found in the DROID DNA, but with 3100mAh battery, the microSD card slot, and the S Pen, make the Samsung offering a real productivity champion. That one comes with an even larger screen though and is unlikely to fit in every pocket. Plus its $100 more expensive than the DROID DNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC DROID DNA is the perfect smartphone for users who are willing to work around its memory limitations. The reward you will be getting is quite substantial - they will enjoy the best mobile display and most powerful silicon at the moment, packed into a good looking body.</paragraph>
