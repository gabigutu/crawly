			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tablets may not be as prominent on this website as smartphones but we are equally passionate about both. And as much as we enjoy testing the latest gadgets in and out, we hope too that while doing that we help you make informed buying decisions. That's what these shopping guides are for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been a while since this article was last updated and that's mainly down to the lack of much movement in the market since December. Keen as ever to not miss anything, we've been closely following all developments. So here's the latest edition of our tablet buying guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cater to a quite diverse international audience, so most of the times we won't be mentioning specific prices but we're sure you'll know a deal when you see one. Our job would be to list what we think are the best tablets out there, so there should be a good enough bang for your buck whichever of these you go for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've broken down our tablet recommendations into three distinct categories: compact, midsize, and full-size. And since tablets generally come in both Wi-Fi-only and 3G/LTE-enabled variants, we've split each section accordingly. On each page the different options will be listed according to their price range - from affordable to ridiculous, each with their merits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get things started in the compact tablet category. Compacts are growing in popularity not only in casual living room environments, but also out in the open and even in corporate scenarios, thanks to their versatility and portability. This category also offers the cheapest way to get into tablets in the first place so we assume there would be a lot of first-time buyers here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, midsize tablets are for people who want a bit more screen estate while still maintaining portability. What exactly constitutes a midsize tablet will be different for each individual user, and can be anywhere between 7.5"-9". We'll give you plenty of choice when it comes to finding the right combination of size, features, and price. This is the newest category of the three and it might as well attract new tablet users who have been so far unwilling to commit to either of the two extremes of the tablet range - the 7-inchers and the 10-inchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, full-size tablets are those that touch or cross the 10" mark. This is where top manufacturers like Samsung, Sony, and Apple will duke it out for dominance. Some of these tablets are just a keyboard away from compact laptop territory, so be sure that this is the way you want to go when you consider your options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each section, we order our recommendations starting with the cheapest, most worthwhile tablets available from a reputable manufacturer. While so-called "whitebox" offerings from lesser-known makers are surging and account for a huge amount of tablet growth - particularly ones running Android - their affordable price is oftentimes the result of using low-cost components and they simply don't offer a reliable and consistent user experience (let alone regular software updates).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above all, we value tablets with high-grade screens, robust performance, good build quality and rich connectivity options. We consider a poor screen to be a deal breaker and having wide viewing angles with no serious shift in colors and contrast is a must for a solid tablet user experience. Where possible, we would always pick a higher resolution screen as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't consider cameras to be important on tablets and if you are only going to view your photos on the tablet's screen, then a high resolution camera is hardly a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like seeing tablets with card slots to cheaply top up the built-in storage but still we reckon 16GB is the minimum built-in memory you should consider. For modern day tablets without card slots, we always recommend getting the 32GB version, as a mere 16GB simply doesn't cut it anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page we get started with our compact tablet recommendations but you can jump right to what you're looking for using the links below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, just sit back and enjoy the latest edition of our tablet shopping guide.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi-only Compact tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this chapter, we'll be focusing on compact tablets measuring about 7" and lacking cellular connectivity. This includes tablets that either do not have 3G-enabled models at all, or the lower-cost Wi-Fi-only versions of tablets that do. The list is sorted by price, low to high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get things underway with the Nook HD tablet from Barnes &amp; Noble (available in the US and the UK). The Nook offers a 7-inch 1440 x 900 display, alongside a rather modest 1.3GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 processor. What the Nook really has going for it, however, is the price - it costs $129/ ?79 respectively. That's less than ?100, so it's a price other major manufacturers simply can't beat. However, Barnes &amp; Noble is more or less clearing its inventory than making a dime on these prices. Rumors are they have a new tablet range to announce in 2014.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some sacrifices were inevitable, of course, and those come in the form of performance and availability. The Nook's TI OMAP 4470 processor is passable at best in terms of processing power and, given that Texas Instruments has retired from the chipset game, could have difficulty getting future Android versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also all Nook tablets come with a custom Nook UI, which is quite far from a true Android experience, so you better know your rooting/CyanogenMod if you are going the Nook's way. If you do however you are in for a big tablet on a bargain basement price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is a compact tablet from Asus. While perhaps not necessarily the first name that springs to mind when it comes to compact size tablets, Asus is now the world's third largest tablet maker and Google's prime tablet hardware partner. And that should tell you something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus MeMo Pad HD7 offers a quad-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. For all intents and purposes, it's a cheaper version of the original Google Nexus 7 (also made by Asus), except that it's running on MediaTek chipset and has a microSD card slot for expanding the limited memory - it's either 8GB or 16GB of built-in storage with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is a bit low on pixel density, but it's an IPS LCD unit so it offers excellent side viewing angles making for a nice user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second generation Nexus 7 (2013) tablet caused quite a stir at its unveiling this summer, and Google/Asus really went out of their usual ways to give the Nexus 7 a complete and thorough upgrade. The tablet is powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset with Adreno 320 GPU, and 2GB of RAM. The Nexus 7 is one of the yet few tablets to run Android 4.4 KitKat, as well. Not to mention it's pretty much the only compact tablet to come with built-in wireless charging capabilities, which is a nice perk even though you'd need an optional wireless charger for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, it's the only one of our tablet recommendations that weighs below 300 grams. The only real downside is that is has no memory card slot, so you should definitely pay the premium to get the 32GB model. The user available storage on the 16GB version simply doesn't cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in terms of raw horsepower, only few tablets can match or beat the Kindle Fire HDX. It runs on a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and Adreno 330 GPU, alongside 2GB of RAM. While it will handily outperform the Nexus 7, its Android version is highly customized and does not have Google Play support. Instead, you'll have to rely on the less-varied Amazon App Store for your app needs and have Amazon's web services replace Google's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card slot on this one either, so we'd recommend at least the 32GB version if you decide to go for the latest Kindle Fire.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3G/4G compact tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you plan on taking your compact tablet on the go - and let's face it, seven-inch or thereabout is the only tablet size that's truly portable - then 3G and LTE are likely on your list of features. After all, there won't be Wi-Fi hotspots everywhere, and a tablet's utility becomes somewhat hampered without being able to go online. What follows is a list of recommended compact tablet offerings that let you connect to a 3G and/or 4G/LTE networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You would probably be buying one of those mobile internet enabled tablets from your mobile carrier so prices will vary, they would be harder to compare and you would probably have limited choice. Still e're ordering the choices bellow based in their commitment free prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus FonePad 7 is a low cost option that has 3G connectivity and even supports making phone calls. You can currently find it for about ?100 less than 3G/4G-enabled variants of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX, which is a tough markup to swallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus just recently announced an LTE version of the Fonepad 7 as well as a Dual SIM version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At around the same price, HP has recently released their HP Slate7 VoiceTab. It's both a tablet and a phone. It offers 16GB of built-in storage for the price Asus is asking for 8GB, and there is also the microSD slot to expand that even further. Not only that, but you also have a 1.2GHz quad-core processor inside the Slate7 VoiceTab and there is a Dual SIM version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no LTE support however and its IPS LCD screen has a relatively low resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP however offers an intriguing option to its US customers. The prepaid HP DataPass mobile data service gives users 250MB worth of wireless data traffic per month for a period of 2 years and HP claims it plans to bundle it with some of its tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 7 with LTE winds up next on our list. It offers a wide array of support for different LTE networks, so you can rest assured it will work in many areas - even if you're traveling overseas. Like with the Wi-Fi-only version, we recommend going for the 32GB version as the Nexus 7 does not have microSD card support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With its quad-core 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 800 processor, the 3G-enabled Kindle Fire HDX brings the same stellar performance of its Wi-Fi-only version into the LTE arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that it suffers from the same limitations as the aforementioned Wi-Fi-only version: there is no Google Play support and no microSD card slot on board. This purchase would tie you in to Amazon's ecosystem of web services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Possessing a distinct iPhone-like design, the Huawei X1 is another tablet that can make and receive calls - and it's also probably the most expensive tablet on this page. It was only recently announced but it's supposed to become available quite soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had a chance to check the X1 out at the MWC 2014 in February and our impressions are only positive. It remains to be seen whether the unusual choice of chipset model - a quad-core Hisilicon Kirin 910 - will play to its advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the 7-inch screen with a resolution of 1200x1920px is certainly eye-catching, as well as the extremely skinny bezels. On the back there is even a 13MP camera, while on the front, there is a 5MP one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got also a clever technology which allows it to charge other devices via the microUSB slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, this one won't come cheap as it's planned to cost around ?400 or about the same as a high-end smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi-only midsize tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's hard to determine where exactly compact ends, midrange begins, and full-size takes over, which is why the screen diagonal margin in this chapter will be fairly large. But, if you're the Goldilocks of tablets and find compact too small and full-size too big, then it's a safe bet that at least one of the tablets mentioned in this section should feel just right. On this page we cover Wi-Fi-only variants, which means that these tablets are best for home or office-only use rather than on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw the 7-inch Nook HD tablet as one of our compact tablet offerings because of its great price, and now here we see the larger 9-inch Nook HD+ for the same reason. The HD+ offers the same dual-core TI OMAP 4470 processor as the Nook HD, except it's clocked higher at 1.5GHz. Screen resolution for the larger display is also bumped up to the respectable 1920 x 1280 pixels (that's more than FullHD on a 9-inch screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same compromises with performance and availability apply though. The Nook's range TI OMAP 4470 processor is a rather dated option that's not going to impress anyone in terms of performance even at 1.5GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nook HD+ is only officially available in the US and the UK and since last Christmas it's only the 32GB version that remains available in the US. At this price Barnes &amp; Nobles however seems more bent on clearing their inventories rather than making a profit and rumor has it they are working on a new range of tablets for 2014 so you better act quickly if you'd like to secure one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All Nook tablets come with a custom Nook UI, which is quite far from a true Android experience, although it does offer access to the Play Store and its large app selection. If you know your way around flashing custom ROM, you can enjoy an official CyanogenMod ROM on the Nook HD+ tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Archos has been slowly building a reputation for affordable yet competitive Wi-Fi-only tablets and its most capable 8-inch offering is exactly that. The Archos 80b Platinum comes with a quad-core 1.6GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. Its screen resolution is a paltry 1024 x 768px, but it's an IPS LCD with excellent viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True, it has only 8GB of internal memory (which you'll need to expand via the microSD card slot), but it does come with all-metal body ala iPad mini and it has a microHDMI port, and is the only offering in the midsize lot that can be had for under ?200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG released its first tablet in a while late last year and it's a gorgeous piece of tech. Featuring a 1200 x 1920 pixel 8.3-inch display (that's more than FullHD), the LG G Pad 8.3 runs on a quad-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600 processor with Adreno 320 GPU and 2GB of RAM, so you'll have no problems with gaming and multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 4,600 mAh battery and IR-port for some multifunctional living room use, plus LG have even thrown in 1080p video and HDR support for its 5MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a built-in GPS chip to give this one an edge over the Wi-Fi only iPad mini, which is probably the only tablet in this class that can match it (and perhaps even beat it) in terms of looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 comes with a handful of neat software tricks, which for instance can keep the screen on for as long as you are actually looking at it or allow you to watch a video on a part of the screen while doing something else on the other part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's only a 16GB model available, so you should factor in the cost of a microSD card with your purchase as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP is obviously stepping up its tablet game and has managed to produce a second entrant in this edition of our tablet shopping guide. The HP Slate8 Pro has an 8-inch diagonal and a resolution of 1200 x 1600 px. The IPS LCD screen is covered by Gorilla Glass 3 for protection, which is always a good thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has an 8MP camera and there is also a microSD slot. It would have a hard time against the LG G Pad 8.3 in Europe where it has pretty much the same price tag, but in the US it actually sells for a lower price, so you might consider it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP however offers an intriguing option to its US customers. The prepaid HP DataPass mobile data service gives users 250MB worth of wireless data traffic per month for a period of 2 years and HP claims it plans to bundle it with some of its tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of raw horsepower, few other tablet can beat the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It runs on a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and Adreno 330 GPU, alongside 2GB of RAM. Then there's the mind-boggling 2560 x 1600px display resolution, which was unmatched in this class until recently. It also features an 8MP primary camera with a front-facer capable of 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind, though, that all Kindle Fire's run on a highly customized Android version without support for Google Play, so you'll have to rely on the less-robust Amazon App Store for your app needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kindle doesn't have a microSD card slot either, so you'd do well to consider the 32GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then the Apple iPad mini 2 (with Retina screen) is definitely worth a look. The latest mini in Apple's popular iPad lineup boasts a 1536 x 2048 7.9-inch Retina display with a 4:3 aspect ratio, which provides more effective screen estate for reading and web browsing than 16:9 tablets. Thanks to Apple's extensive app store, there's no shortage of very functional and polished apps and games for even the most demanding among you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 does not come with a microSD card slot, so we recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup. Another downside is that the Wi-Fi only version of the iPad mini also lacks a GPS chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you really want to splurge, Samsung has recently released their premium mid-size tablet - the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. It is priced even higher than the Apple iPad mini 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also offers a much higher 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution and a Snapdragon 800 processor, the combination of which probably makes it the fastest and meanest mid-size tablet there is. The 8MP camera with 1080p video recording and the microSD card slot complete the landmark features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It not only comes with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat) but Samsung has also baked a spanking new tablet interface of their own, which truly elevates the tablet user experience to a whole new level (the split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res screen tablets).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3G/4G midsize tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you want to take your tablet on the go, then being able to rely on a 3G and/or LTE connection is almost a must. This section is for those of us that don't want to have to constantly bounce from Wi-Fi network to Wi-Fi network when we're out and about with our tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, comes the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 8. While its 1280 x 800 pixel display and quad-core MediaTek 1.2GHz processor may not be the best around, the Yoga 8 is one of the most affordable 8-inch tablets to offer 3G connectivity. Plus, its built-in 3-stage kickstand, 6,000 mAh battery and Dolby Digital Plus sound enhancement make it a great media player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen may have a low resolution but it's an IPS LCD and has great side viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga Tablet 8 does have fairly limited 3G network connectivity (it supports only two HSDPA bands - 900/2100Mhz), so be sure it has the right coverage for your area if you decide to get one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 makes our list here thanks in large part to its extensive LTE support. The 8-inch tablet otherwise has low screen resolution of 800 x 1280px, and gets beat out by the LG G Pad 8.3 in terms of performance as well, but the LG offering has an LTE version only in the US and only for Sprint so the comparison is irrelevant here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 8.0 also has a wide array of connectivity extras, including an IR-port and an USB Host support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, Samsung's excellent pressure-sensitive S-Pen is perfect for jotting things down or doodling away and there's hardly a tablet out there that can match it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9's LTE-enabled variant comes next. When it comes to pure processing power, very few other tablets can match or beat its quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and Adreno 330 GPU alongside 2GB of RAM. The 2560 x 1600px display resolution also provides unparalleled until recently sharpness. It also features an 8MP primary camera with a front-facer capable of 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind, though, that all Kindle Fires run on a highly customized Android version without support for Google Play, so you'll have to rely on the less-robust Amazon App Store for your app needs. It also doesn't have microSD card support, so we recommend at least the 32GB version if you decide to go for a Kindle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 again brings up the rear for buyers for whom cost is not an issue. Apple's latest mini has a 7.9" Retina display at 1536 x 2048px and a 4:3 aspect ratio. Apple's App store is second-to-none when it gets to tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE-enabled version offers an immensely wide LTE band support. It also has the benefit of a built-in GPS chip, something with the Wi-Fi only version lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 does not come with a microSD card slot, so we recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Usually, it was the Apple iPad range, which we recommended to buyers for whom cost was not an issue. But Samsung has recently released their premium mid-size tablet, which is even more expensive than Apple's latest iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 also happens to have both a 3G and an LTE version. They cover more network bands that you can shake a stick at so choosing either will have you covered in most parts of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 key selling feature is a 2560 x 1600px screen, a Snapdragon 800 processor, an 8MP camera with 1080p video recording and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It not only comes with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat) but Samsung has also baked a spanking new tablet interface of their own, which truly elevates the tablet user experience to a whole new level (the split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res screen tablets).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi-only full-size tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you must have the best, full-size tablets is where it's at. With 10-inch and higher display sizes, you'll have plenty of screen estate for enjoying multimedia content. If you're going this big then display fidelity plays a much bigger part, so we'll only be listing tablets with eye-popping pixel density in our full-size recommendations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is another offering from Archos, this time in the 9.7-inch flavor. The Archos 97b Platinum HD features a very respectable 2048 x 1536px screen, which is the same diagonal and aspect ratio of the new Apple iPad Air. There is all metal on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll find a decent 1.6GHz quad-core Rockchip RK3188 (Cortex-A9) processor and 2GB of RAM. Performance-wise, this chipset puts out 17251 at AnTuTu, so it's in roughly the same ballpark as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Google Nexus 4, both of which have to cater for less than a third of the Archos 97b Platinum HD number of screen pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, with this tablet you'll have to rely on an extra microSD card to build on the very limited 8GB of internal memory. But you'll have more than enough money left over, as the 97b Platinum is still more affordable than most competitors' 8-inch offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 97b Platinum HD has a few identical twins by more marginal manufacturers. Some of those tablets may appeal to people who are looking for a decent tablet at bargain basement prices. For instance, the QiLive 97r is a commissioned Archos 97b Platinum HD rebrand for certain sellers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the German only brands Odys (their Odys Iron tablet), Captiva (their Captiva Pad 9.7 Super FHD and Captiva Pad 10.1 Quad FHD tablets), Xoro and Blaupunkt (their Endeavour 1010 tablet). There is also the Chinese Onda V972 tablet, which is an identical twin of the Blaupunkt Endeavour 1010. These have pretty close specs to the Archos tablet with slightly different external design. Unfortunately, none of these tablet makers (or rather sellers) can be considered major per se, so getting into details about those would be crossing a line we promised we won't cross.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus makes it to our Wi-Fi-only list with its affordable yet capable Memo Pad FHD10 tablet. At 1920 x 1200 pixels, the 10-inch IPS LCD display provides great sharpness and wide viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Atom Z2560 processor isn't the fastest out there, the 2GB of RAM should help take some of the pressure off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also 1080p video recording for the camera, which, along with the high resolution screen, trumps the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 (though this one's some 30% cheaper than the Memo Pad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo Pad FHD10 also comes in some interesting color options like Royal Blue and Vivid Pink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's Nexus 10 offering by Samsung is now a year old, but has aged well thanks to its dual-core 1.7GHz Exynos 5250 chipset and excellent 2560 x 1600 pixel Super PLS TFT display. The resulting pixel density is just under 300 ppi. That and the 1080p video recording, Android 4.4 KitKat, and ample 9,000 mAh battery make it a very compelling value for its now reduced price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there is no microSD card slot, so we recommend you go for the 32GB version. This one would run you about the same price as the Memo Pad FHD10 (coupled with an extra 32GB card), so choosing either of them is really about choosing your priorities: having expandable and removable storage vs. a higher-res screen, a bigger battery and timely Android updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the quad-core 1.7GHz Tegra 4 CPU, FullHD display, and solid construction with 2-stage kickstand make for quite a compelling offering, and the ample amount of storage is expandable via microSD. There's also the full MS Office suite that comes preinstalled, which is the sort of productivity tool you will have a hard time finding on competing platforms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows RT offers a fluid user experience but it's nether Windows Phone, nor regular Windows, so there is not that big of a choice of apps and also the only way you get those is via the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows RT platform is further made irrelevant by the influx of many compelling tablets, running the proper version of Windows on Intel's new Bay Trail architecture (you will know the by the chipset model named something like this Z3xxx).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you plan on getting one of the (rather expensive) keyboard covers, we recommend the Type cover, as the Touch cover offers no tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia Tablet Z is one of the most stylish tablet offerings you'll see at this or any other size with ultra-slim 6.9mm waistline. Under the hood there's a 1.5GHz Snapdragon processor with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU, and Sony is already working on an Android 4.4 KitKat update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively small 6,000mAh battery is the only real downside, as you may not get much time between charges, but battery life is still passable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was only last month that Sony announced their next gen tablet. Dubbed the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, it has a faster Snapdragon 801 chipset and an 8MP back camera with improved Exmor RS sensor. It also has an improved water resistance - this time it would gladly take a dip in the kiddie pool for up to 30 minutes. There is also the latest Android 4.4 KitKat on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's rated battery times are lower though, which doesn't bode well for its market chances. The battery life of the original model was not stellar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet is supposed to have its market launch in March. We guess, that would make the previous generation even more affordable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're big on typing, then Asus has you covered again with its latest Transformer Pad TF701T. Basically a MeMo Pad on steroids, the TF701T comes with an ultra-crisp 2560 x 1600 pixel screen, a hefty quad-core 1.9 GHz Tegra 4 processor, and 32GB of expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly, the Transformer earns its moniker by being the only tablet that also comes with a keyboard dock as part of the retail package, making it a great deal, but that's not to say it comes cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition) brings an incredibly sharp 2560 x 1600 pixel display, 3GB of RAM, and quad-core Snapdragon 800 to the table. Samsung's great pressure-sensitive S-Pen offers something other tablets simply can't match. The pleasant leather-like textured plastic back from the Note 3 has also made its way to its elder sibling and it works great visually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if price is not a factor, then the Apple iPad Air brings an ultra-sharp display alongside Apple's proprietary A7 chipset. The iPad Air features a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is arguably the more user-friendly aspect for web browsing or reading and also offers more screen real estate for the same diagonal. Thanks to Apple's extensive app store, there's no shortage of functional and innovative apps and games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air does not come with a microSD card slot, so we recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recent release of Samsung's Pro range of tablets marks the first time when Samsung dares release tablets that are priced higher than the iPad range. And if it wasn't for the superior Apple App Store this time we would have argued their move is quite reasonable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 has a seriously high price tag but it's a spectacular piece of tech. It offers a beautiful screen that has higher resolution than the iPad Air, a micro SD slot, an 8MP camera, and a capable octa-core Exynos chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It not only comes with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat), but Samsung has also baked in a spanking new tablet interface of their own, which truly elevates the tablet user experience to a whole new level (the split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res tablets).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you really want to splurge you might as well pick up either of the two new Samsung 12.2 tablets. There is the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, if you are after Samsung's exclusive pressure-sensitive stylus functionality. Other than that there is not that much difference between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have 12.2-inch screens with 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution, a minimum of 32GB of built-in storage plus a card slot, octa-core Exynos chipsets and 8MP cameras with 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, those come come with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat) coupled with Samsung's home-baked goodies that bring a huge boost to productivity. The split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res screen tablets and it's brilliantly implemented here, allowing to run up to four apps side by side plus even more in the form of floating windows.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3G/4G full-size tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Large or not, sometimes you just want to take your tablet out. This section is for those of us that don't want to have to constantly bounce from one Wi-Fi network to the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo's Yoga Tablet 10 comes first in this section as it's the most affordable decent 10-inch tablet currently available that also offers 3G connectivity. Although its 1280 x 800 pixel resolution stretches a bit thin on such a large display, at least it's an IPS LCD unit that offers great viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-core 1.2GHz processor of the Tablet 10 has little trouble pumping out all the pixels to the screen and it feels snappy (though probably not lightning fast).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the trademark built-in 3-stage kickstand, a 9,000mAh battery and dual front stereo speakers with Dolby Digital Plus for multimedia viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga Tablet 10 does have fairly limited 3G network connectivity (it supports only HSDPA bands 900/2100), so be sure it has the right coverage for your area if you decide to get one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo recently announced their Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10+, which brings up the resolution to 1920x1200 pixels and has a better processor, but it would be a while until it reaches the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's first tablet offering, the Nokia Lumia 2520, was revealed late last year, running Windows 8.1 RT. With a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor, a FullHD screen and a solid unibody construction, the Lumia 2520 is a promising gadget. It's also got Dolby headphone sound enhancement and is one of the first tablets to support USB 3.0 with USB host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's some capable hardware, but despite it and the presence of LTE, the Lumia 252 is priced the same as the Wi-Fi only iPad Air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you have got to remember that even with Nokia's own software goodies added to the mix, Windows RT has a hard time competing with its rivals in anything but office-related productivity tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This device, much like the Surface tablets, failed to turn the prospects of Windows RT for the better. And the situation is unlikely to change any soon as all other major manufacturers and Microsoft partners have abandoned Windows RT and have turned their attention to making tablets running the full-featured Windows (thanks to Intel's Atom Bay Trail Z3xxx chipsets). The only mainstay of the Windows RT tablets remains the built-in mobile network connectivity, which the Atom Bay Trail chipsets still don't offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE version of the stylish Sony's Xperia Tablet Z makes its way into this section as one of the more affordable top-tier 10-inchers. You get a 1.5GHz Snapdragon processor with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU, and Sony is committed to bringing an Android 4.4 KitKat update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was only last month that Sony announced their next gen tablet. Dubbed the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, it has a faster Snapdragon 801 chipset and an 8MP back camera with improved Exmor RS sensor. It also has an improved water resistance - this time it would gladly take a dip in the kiddie pool for up to 30 minutes. There is also the latest Android 4.4 KitKat on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's rated battery times are lower though, which doesn't bode well for its market chances. The battery life of the original model was not stellar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet is supposed to have its market launch in March. We guess, that would make the previous generation even more affordable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition's LTE brings the incredibly sharp 2560 x 1600 pixel display, 3GB of RAM, and quad-core Snapdragon 800 performance of the Wi-Fi-only variant, and bumps up the clock speed to 2.3GHz. Also an LTE exclusive is the Adreno 330 GPU and 1080p@60fps video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's great pressure-sensitive S-Pen offers something other tablets simply can't match. The pleasant leather-like textured plastic back from the Note 3 has also made its way to its elder sibling and it works great visually though the faux stitches don't look that premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if money is of no object, the Apple iPad Air brings LTE connectivity and an ultra-sharp display alongside Apple's proprietary A7 chipset. Having access to Apple's App store, the Air get to choose from the largest selection of tablet-optimized apps in existence, which is certainly its key weapon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE-enabled version offers an immensely wide LTE band support. It also has the benefit of having a built-in GPS chip, something which the Wi-Fi only version lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air does not come with a microSD card slot, so you'd either have to pay close to ?700 for the 32GB version or constantly find yourself lacking enough storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The  Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 is yet another Samsung tablet that aims to get away with a pricetag higher than its Apple rivals. It has a beautiful high-res screen, a micro SD slot, an 8MP camera, and a capable octa-core chipset to show for it. And it happens to have fine 3G and LTE versions. They cover more network bands that you can shake a stick at so choosing either will have you covered in most parts of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big spenders might as well pick up either of the two new Samsung Pro 12.2 tablets as they both have 3G and LTE networks. There is the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 with the latter offering Samsung's exclusive pressure-sensitive stylus functionality. Other than that there is not that much difference between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have 12.2-inch screens with 2560 x 1600px resolution, a minimum of 32GB of built-in storage plus a card slot, octa-core Exynos chipsets and 8MP cameras with 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the tablets in the Samsung Pro range come with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat) but Samsung has also baked in a spanking new tablet interface of their own, which truly elevates the tablet user experience to a whole new level. The split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res screen tablets and it's brilliantly implemented here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The developments in the tablet market over this past couple of months are not major, but they are still interesting. For one, Samsung has a whole new Pro range that sells for more money than Apple's range of iPads. That's certainly a change few had expected. Hardly anyone else but Apple can afford such a steep asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried to leave out most 10-inch tablets with 1280x800px resolution even though some of them, like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, are among the current bestsellers. This may come as a surprise to some, but 1080p slates backed with enough processing power to carry the resolution have fallen down in price and we no longer find the compromise worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, this is probably the last guide where we are recommending the Windows RT tablets. The Windows RT platform is been quickly made irrelevant by fast and capable Android offers on one side and the influx of many compelling tablets, running the proper version of Windows on Intel's new Bay Trail architecture on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without undermining their importance, we've deliberately left them out of this article. These tablets generally are outside of our main expertise as they are pretty much straightforward Windows computers. Their low price points however allow them to inevitably come up in the conversation whenever tablet purchase is considered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more notable products on the market of this sort include the mid-sized Toshiba Encore 8, the Lenovo Miix 2 8, and the Dell Venue 8 Pro. All three of them have 1.86GHz Intel Atom Z3740 chipsets with Intel HD graphics, 2GB of RAM, 1280 x 800px screens, front and rear cams and run fully-fledged Windows 8.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the 10-inchers most notable are probably the 10.1-inch Asus Transformer Book T100 and the HP Omni 10. The Asus Transformer Book T100 comes with a detachable keyboard dock, which can even host an optional 500GB HDD. The Asus tablet however lacks a camera on the back and the otherwise good 10-inch screen has a resolution of only 1366 x 768 pixels. The HP Omni 10 is a bit cheaper, has cameras on both front and back and comes with a FullHD resolution, but it lacks a keyboard dock eve as an option. Both of these have excellent real-life battery life of up to 10 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When choosing one of these newfangled Windows tablets, bear in mind that their cheaper 32GB versions already have most of the storage taken up by the system files, so there is hardly any room for installing additional applications. The microSD slot is great for storing your multimedia files, but not so good for apps so 64GB storage is probably the minimum you should be looking at there.</paragraph>
