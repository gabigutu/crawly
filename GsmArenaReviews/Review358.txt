			<paragraph>Nokia N95 is among the first mobile phones on the European market to ever offer a 5-megapixel resolution. What's more, its camera features a Carl Zeiss lens, automatic focus, and detailed user-configurable settings. Nevertheless, our experience tells us that on paper specs usually sound a lot more exciting than they are in reality. That is why we will put Nokia N95 to a detailed and extremely rigorous test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-function camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera is located on the rear side of the device; the lens is protected by a mechanical cover opened with an easy slide. Fortunately it's not that easy to let the cover open spontaneously, for example in case of pulling the phone out of one's pocket. The cover is active, that is, its opening activates the camera application. When you closed it, the keypad lock is activated automatically and vice versa - opening it unlocks the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Nokia N95</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both activation and deactivation of the camera application is accompanied by gradual l lighting up of the side functional keys backlighting, just like in Nokia N73. On the right side, under your right pointing finger you will find a large release button; right next to it is an instant-access key to the Gallery; there is also a dual zoom key located under your left finger. To sum up, taking pictures with the phone is as natural as with your common digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Lens is protected</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the front there is another camera for video calls, which can also be used for taking pictures. It creates images of up to 640 × 480 pixels and might be quite useful for portraits to go into the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the frame of the lens you will also see a powerful LED flash (not as powerful as a xenon flash, of course). Unfortunately, there is no setup option in the menu that would allow permanent activation of the flash so that this can be used as a torch, as seen in other Nokia phones. A special program providing such an option could probably be downloaded additionally, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Optics from Carl Zeiss </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QVGA display (2.6 inch) serves as a viewfinder of the 5-megapixel camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera settings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It takes 6 seconds to get the camera application running. If you manage to focus immediately, then your first shot will probably take you about 8 seconds, which is rather slow, especially considering the frequent use of photo mobiles as opportunist cameras for taking instant shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To take a shot, first half-press the release button until the focusing frame becomes green, and then press the release button fully; just like you would do with a standard digital camera. Available are 4 different shutter sounds, each of which can be silenced completely should the phone has been set to silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera viewfinder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera application is very user-friendly and easy to manage. Function icons are displayed on the right and switched between by using the vertical ways of the navigation key. The horizontal ways duplicate the zoom function, also available on the phone side. When a function is selected, an additional menu pops out. The upper context key closes functions, while the bottom one opens the option menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera menu and setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among other options here you will find camera resolution settings, automatic insertion of images into albums, shutter sound setup, or default storage. Once you have set up all above mentioned features, they remain saved even if the camera application has been restarted. However, the same does not hold true for the functions displayed in the right menu column, which load their default settings each time the camera is activated.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ISO setup from phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's now have a closer look at the camera functions displayed in the right menu column:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoom: the zoom is managed through its own control elements, so it is not available in the menu. The phone zooms digitally, that is, the image gets cropped. The result is a less sharp, interpolated image. The digital zoom achieves good results when shooting in lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big thumbnails a linked to sample pictures in full resolution ( 1-1.5MB), the small ones point to resampled photos to 800 × 600 pixels.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Running for first prize<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Picture quality is very good. As you'd probably expect, we are working on a comparative review between Nokia N95 and the best current photo mobile Sony Ericsson K800, which we are going to publish soon. We can guess that Nokia N95 will come out as a winner of such a competition. The images it creates maintain their sharpness throughout the entire frame. Higher resolution allow for printing on bigger formats as well as for creating crops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that any direct comparison between Nokia N95 and other mobiles situates the former on the very top of the chart. Its drawbacks only become obvious in confrontation with a standard digital camera. And that is exactly what we did: we picked up a Sony DSC-H1 camera and took a number of comparative photos.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apparently the most significant con of Nokia N95's pictures is their cold touch, which frequently results in a light violet shade. This drawback is best visible in pictures taken shortly before sunset. Sony software evaluated light conditions exactly and left nuances of yellowish sunlight, while the pictures taken with Nokia N95 look like they were taken in early afternoon. Nokia N95 does not feature any special white balance option to make colors look more natural. Whatsoever, its images do not look bad at all; besides, any inaccuracies could be easily eliminated with some editing program on a PC.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Tip: more sample images can be found in the third chapter of this article!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JPEG compression is quite strong - surface seems "patched" under closer examination, while details tend to disappear. The small size of the lens significantly contributes to blurring of details as well. A closer comparison between the images taken with Nokia N95 and those created with a digital Sony camera confirms the advantages of using a bigger lens. Anyway, the differences are not at all as drastic as one might have expected; the pictures taken with both devices would have been nearly identical, if it were not for the different color nuance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>VGA video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N95 can be also used as a video camera. You can record videos of average quality in 3GP format, suitable to go into MMS as well as high-quality videos in resolution of 640 × 480 pixels; the latter speed up to 30 shots in a second. High-quality videos are recorded in MP4 format, but they use an enormous amount of MB - half a minute of such a video "eats up" approximately 10 MB. Videos maximum length only depends on the available free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Viewfinder in video recording mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Video camera menu and its setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video function menu is somewhat poorer than the camera one. Here you will find shooting mode settings, white balance, and a number of color nuances. You can zoom in digitally while recording, but zooming is not fluent, and most of all, it worsens the overall image quality. The microphone can be silenced if you wish. Another unusual function in the menu is the so called image stabilizer, but its influence is almost invisible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample videos in full resolution:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos look brilliant both on the phone display and on a TV screen. On a PC screen, however, they come out much too colorful, with a far too high contrast. Nevertheless, for the moment this is the best you can get from a photo mobile on the market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Substitute for a digital camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N95's glamorous presence along with the latest bunch of cameraphones marks the beginning of difficult times for common small compact cameras. The trend of replacing the compact camera with photo mobiles has been long spoken about and it will surely remain one of the hottest topics for some time. Yet, putting this trend in practice is going to take long time. For example, many users already perceive Sony Ericsson K800 as a full-functioning substitute for a common camera; its drawback is its resolution: 3 megapixels only. It does not mean that three megapixels are not enough for the production of a good-quality image; it is when mobile phones are confronted with standard cameras that the cameras score higher as their minimum resolution is 5 megapixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewing images ? editing options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes Nokia N95 with its 5 megapixels, auto focus, and very good optics. Yet, it lacks manual exposure settings and a high-quality xenon flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from pure shooting options Nokia N95 also offers extras like filing pictures into albums, sending pictures in MMS or emails, or even sending images to a photographic blog within Flickr or Vox services. Pictures can be modified in the phone before they are uploaded.</paragraph>

			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nokia N95 in full glamour - it captures images of quality so high that they seem as if taken with a common digital camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;The same green in three photos - Nokia N95 meets certain difficulties in balancing colors </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Macro is one of Nokia N95's strengths</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backlit photos are good - the sun is reasonably suppressed and, at the same time, visualization in darker areas remains pretty clear</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Indoors under artificial light - here Nokia managed the white balance very well, even though the above images were taken in automatic mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures taken in the dark - there is far less noise than we have expected. Instead, the phone extended exposure time, so firm hand was needed to manage the shot. Anyway, the tram was too fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Scarcely illuminated night street in automatic mode ? in night mode ? in a minimum resolution mode for noise reduction (it would have been helpful if a longer exposure time was possible to set up; not available, unfortunately)&nbsp;LED flash in action</paragraph>
