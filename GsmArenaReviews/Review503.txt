			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S is somewhat of a weird fit in Huawei's current device lineup. It is not the eagerly anticipated successor to the Mate7 (that would be the soon to be announced Mate 8), nor is it part of the Honor family, or bothered with an Ascend moniker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the model's main struggle is not that it does not fit anywhere, quite the opposite, it seems to carry a little bit of all the aforementioned aspects, spliced in with years of Huawei expertise and even a dash of cutting-edge Force Touch innovation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while that may sound like too much of a mess to ever work, it truly does, making the Mate S an excellent all-round device, with little compromises, at least on the surface, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Mate S is definitely an attempt to shake things up and experiment with new ideas, hence the "S" moniker, but it lives up to its flagship legacy with an impressive specs sheet. It rocks the impressive custom HiSilicon Kirin 935 chip, also found inside the Honor 7 and P8max, along with a crisp 5.5-inch AMOLED display, 3GB of RAM and up to 128GB of onboard storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aforementioned Force Touch display technology is also quite impressive and a first on the Android scene, but it has limited availability only on select markets with a 128GB unit. This might come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of you (us included), but it all depends on how you look at things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Confining the new feature to a select audience actually allows the Mate S to shine as a complete package and not be defined by Force Touch alone, as is often the case with early technology adopters. And the Mate S definitely has a lot to impress with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S is a true flagship, no doubt about it, but before we go too overboard with the praises, we can't fail to mention some of its off-putting aspects, like the price tag, which is comparable to that of most any other flagship contender currently out there. And yes, we do realize that that isn't something to criticize in itself, but combined with the particular Kirin chipset, it could prove to be a deal-breaking combination to some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kirin chips have frequently failed to deliver high-end performance in the past, so that's one thing we'll certainly watch closely. Hopefully, this trend will be broken by the upcoming Kirin 950, which does show great promise, but until then, we need to be mindful of Huawei's performance in this respect, especially if it comes with a flagship-worthy pricetag. And even if the eight ARM cores prove efficient enough to run the phone smoothly, the Mali-T628 MP4 GPU has provided a hugely underwhelming experience in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not rush to judgment though. Follow along to see the Huawei Mate S from every angle before we proceed to benchmarking.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Mate S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mate S has a gorgeous profile and looks incredible all around. The thin metal edges really make for a premium feel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we said the Mate S took a lot of cues from all around the Huawei device lineup, we definitely meant it, especially design-wise. We can't help but notice that the handset looks almost identical to the Mate7 on the front. Its display is also quite wide, leaving almost no side bezels and comes to an end with a nice 2.5D curvature of the glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker grill on the top and the Huawei logo on the bottom complete the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back, however, the Mate S is a mixture of the aforementioned Mate7 with its antenna lines and the Honor 7, as far as the camera and fingerprint size and position is concerned at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate S is almost entirely made of metal, it has premium looks and its build quality is superb, quite fitting for the Mate series. As far as color options go, it has quite a few of those and all looks good with the metal finish. They include - Luxurious Gold, Titanium Grey, Mystic Champagne and Rose Gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate S is a really thin device and the sensation is only intensified further by its double sloping edges, both on the front and the back. The curve on the back side also improves handling greatly and helps the unit sit snugly in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's body measures 149.8 x 75.3 x 7.2 mm, which is even thinner than the Mate7, not to mention the Honor 7. The Mate S is also surprisingly light and tips the scale at 156 grams, just about what the overall smaller Honor 7 weighs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the Mate S offers a nice amalgam of different Huawei traits. The same goes for the controls and their layout. Buttons are laid out conveniently and everything is within easy reach. The buttons are also quite responsive, so we are definitely glad that Huawei hasn't been changing things too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is really minimalist. Nothing is really out of place or out of measure. Huawei has opted for a 5.5-inch FullHD panel. It is noticeably bigger than the one in the Honor 7, but also quite smaller than the whopping 6.0 inches on the Mate7. It seems to sit in the ideal middle ground at least as far as current trends go and apart from the compact size, it has one potential advantage over both of its siblings - the AMOLED screen. But more on that in the display section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the main controls on the actual screen, the only thing underneath is a company logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is not much else in plain sight on the front of the device. There is the earpiece and the 8MP front-facing camera, tightly packed next to it, along with a front-facing flash. Well, more of a flashlight actually, but it is enough to bring some light on night-time selfies. The LED in question is covered by a light gray finish, presumably for filtering purposes, but it does stand out as a sort of an eye-sore, but that is just nitpicking. There are also proximity and light sensors beside the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going around the device, we find the left side almost entirely bare. It only houses the SIM card/microSD tray (yes, one of the slots doubles on the Dual SIM model).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side is where it gets busier. It still doesn't feel cluttered and it really shouldn't be, considering there is only the power button and the volume rockers. Both have a nice oval shape and precision cut design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button has a grippy pattern, but we can't imagine you could really mistake it for anything else as it's quite shorter than the volume key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed at the top of the device. Next to it is the secondary noise-canceling microphone. Well, actually it could be considered the third, as there are two more on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Huawei Mate S has two symmetrical grilles, but only one of them houses a speaker. The aforementioned pair of microphones is hidden under the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here we also find a pair of screws for the main body assembly and, of course, the micro USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the back side of the Mate S offers a sloped design for improved handling and an even thinner edge. There are two plastic antenna inserts to facilitate radio reception. Their shape and placement is almost identical to the Mate7 - one on the top and the other at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module is also quite familiar with its square shape, but with the dual-tone LED flash on the right-hand side, it is much more reminiscent of the Honor 7. The only other control on the back is the new and improved fingerprint reader. It may look unchanged on the outside, but it's actually better than the previous generations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is truly among the fastest and most accurate implementations we have seen. It rarely introduces any delay to the user experience and thanks to the tiny co-processor inside the Kirin 935, it can stay always-on and unlock your device seamlessly even with the screen off. It is a joy to use and its placement also makes a lot of sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, in the Mate S, said sensor now doubles as a touch control as well and recognizes simple swipe gestures. It can be used to bring down the notification shade or scroll through photos in the gallery. That will surely be useful to some, but it does take some getting used to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the Mate S is equipped with a 5.5 inch AMOLED display, which is a rarity in the Huawei product portfolio. True, we?ve seen AMOLED-equipped Huawei phones before, like the Ascend P1, but recently, the only other device to make use of the technology is the Huawei-made Nexus 6P.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This gives the Mate S a potential advantage over siblings like the Mate7, Honor 7 or the P8, which all rely on LCD technology. The displays on the aforementioned handsets are excellent in their own right and besides the improved power consumption when showing black screens and the generally spectacularly deep blacks, AMOLED technology doesn?t have as much advantage over LCDs for the end user. We admit we do have a knack for it and its amazing contrast though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems Huawei was a bit overzealous to showcase all that punchiness and perhaps has went slightly overboard with the default color saturation, notably so with the red hue (DeltaE of 13.1). The rest of the colors are actually not that bad, but the average DeltaE for the primaries along with white and black is 8.1, which is well above the desirable limit of 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a slider in the Settings menu that allows you to give the screen tuning to a warmer or cooler tones. Moving the slider slightly to the warmer side changed mostly the whites, which brought the AverageDeltaE down to 6.8 but did little for the saturation of the other colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum brightness of the Mate S screen is quite good for an AMOLED display (372nits), though we gotta admit we?ve seen better on Samsung?s devices. The Samsung Galaxy Note5 for instance, could manually be pushed up to 439nits and even more so in Auto mode where it reached a peak brightness of 620nits for a limited amount of time and only in bright light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outside of Samsung?s devices, this sort of brightness level is actually slightly above average ? we think that the Meizu Pro 5 (320nits) and the Oppo R7 Plus (351nits) would agree on that one. So outside of the overeagerly tuned color output, we?d reckon the Mate S carries one top notch screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the less-than-impressive maximum brightness, however, AMOLED technology provides excellent sunlight legibility to the Mate S. A score of 3.073 is definitely above average in our current database.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Mate S battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mate S is equipped with a 2700 mAh battery, sealed in behind the back panel. Its capacity is quite modest, especially when we consider that the Honor 7 has 3100 mAh at its disposal and the Mate7 has a whopping 4100 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is slightly disconcerting, but the Mate S's battery life hasn't taken too much of a dent. Still, if you are coming from another Huawei device, like one of the aforementioned two, you might notice a slight reduction as the Mate S scored a slightly lower endurance rating with a total of 60 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, however, the reduced battery life isn't nearly as bad as the mAh shortage would suggest. The phone's modem seems to leave a sizeable dent, reflected both in the poor call and standby times, but we've definitely seen a lot worse and 60 hours put the Mate S around the middle of our battery endurance database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary rating denotes the number of hours the phone will be operational if you are to make an hour of 3G talks, web browsing and video playback per day. Such usage pattern is of course entirely artificial, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As previously mentioned, the Huawei Mate S comes in both a single SIM and dual SIM variant. The latter offers dual standby, but the second SIM slot shares a cradle with the microSD card, so having two active cellular connections has its tradeoff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S comes with quad-band GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz, multi-band 3G (model and market dependent). LTE Cat.6 is supported for downlink speeds of up to 300Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is duly covered with dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ with hotspot support. Bluetooth v4.0 is on board as well, and so is GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS. NFC is enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Emotion UI v3.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S boots the company's own EMUI. It's the latest EMUI 3.1, which is the first iteration to be based on Android Lollipop, instead of KitKat. It is also worth noting that we have seen Emotion UI 3.1 work on top of Android 5.0 in the past. This time around, however, it utilizes Android 5.1.1 and reaps all the benefits from Google's improvements. Still, from an interface and UX point of view, little has changed and Huawei users will feels right at home thanks to impressive level of continuity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EMUI 3.1 is based on Google's new platform and yet, it is the similarities with previous Emotion UI versions that seem to stick out, rather than the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Huawei has done, in a nutshell, is adopt Android Lollipop, without Google's new material design. The user interface has remained flat with almost no traces of Google's latest aesthetics. EMUI 3.1 remains true to its style and has preserved the user experience mostly intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fans will also be happy to know that the OS is still packed full of various extras and additional functions, baked right in. Some of them we found to be quite useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen features a nifty "sunshine" effect as you drag your finger across. Huawei's signature feature is the option for changing the lockscreen wallpaper automatically with beautiful images on various topics. You can also have widgets on the lockscreen, iOS-style shortcuts, and even dual clocks when roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you use the fingerprint reader for unlocking, then you can skip the lockscreen interface altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In previous versions of the OS, these lockscreen graphics used to be referred to as Covers and have a pretty rich collection of customization options, including a dedicated download center, complete with channels, subscriptions and auto-updates. All that seems to be absent from the Android 5.1.1-based EMUI 3.1, or at least the Mate S, that is and it might be missed by fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, some of the functionality remains and it is spread out between two interfaces. One is found within the settings menu, under Display options, where you can set the lockscreen and homescreen wallpapers separately. The rest of the tweaks are found in the extensive theming interface, but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping from the bottom of the lockscreen reveals a very iOS-like quick shortcut menu. It holds shortcuts to a recorder, calculator, flashlight and the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts, which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are nine homescreen panes at most - and at least a couple of them will be populated by the preinstalled apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is customary for Chinese Android UIs, there is no app drawer like there would be on vanilla Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anything you install pops up on the homescreen, just as it would on an iPhone or a Xiaomi. While this means that you don't have to bother creating shortcuts to your apps on the homescreens, it also means that you cannot effectively hide any of your installed apps either. You can, however, group them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Widgets are available too - it's mostly the stock Android ones, but Huawei has thrown in some of its own as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system and app icons, system font, system color and the sound profile. You can also adjust things like homescreen transition effects, and even change your wallpapers at random or specific time intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The theming engine is so powerful that it can basically transform the UI and offer incredibly varied experiences. It even offers access to a vast online library of ready-made themes. Anything you download can also be customized further to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two pages - one that hold all notifications sorted in a timeline, and another for all of your quick toggles. You can swap around the ones you want visible on the first three rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shade has undergone some degree of modification in MIUI 3.1. It is now transparent and creates a blur effect underneath, quite reminiscent of iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S features a task switcher that lets you swipe away unwanted apps. A swipe form the bottom of the screen clears everything and tells you how much memory you've freed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Mate S isn't just big on eye-candy. Huawei has invested quite a lot of effort in various usability and accessibility features and most things that are not customizable through theming can still be rearranged and moved around. The phone comes with features, such as customizable navigation bar, simple homescreen, Do not disturb mode, and even one-hand optimizations for system apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode is self-explanatory - you can schedule it when to turn on and off, and you can add a list of exceptions. And for the rest of the time, when you would like to ensure a clean and stable connection with the outside world, there is Link+. It has a smart WiFi and Mobile data switching component for stable internet, as well as a Signal+ mode for enhancing cellular connectivity when travelling on a fast moving vehicle such as a high-speed train.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Various display options are also accessible on a system-wide level. The UI can be tailored to your needs and the lockscreen can be as secure as you would like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>EMUI 3.1 offers granular control over app permissions and their access to various system functions, such as network data and notification areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate S features a notification center, from which you can control which apps can send you the three types of available notifications - the shade notifications, the lockscreen notifications and the banner style notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This level of control is also employed when it comes to the app access to network data. The user can control the rights of each application to access either WiFi or mobile data. This can save a lot of traffic and help you optimize your data plan and consumption in an easy and convenient way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has given battery management an equally thorough treatment. EMUI has a dedicated interface for managing what it refers to as protected apps. The notion is that only applications that are deemed necessary by the user can be left to run in the background and consume battery and possibly network data, when the screen is off. Any app not on the list has no such privileges. This level of control is astounding and we really wish that other manufacturers would adopt similar mechanisms to give back users granular control of their hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom navigation bar with the default Android controls is customizable - you can swap the task-switcher and back keys, or even add a shortcut for the notification area. You can hide the navigation bar and bring it back with an upwards swipe from the bottom. There is also a one-handed UI mode, for easier menu surfing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motion control is also big on the Huawei Mate S. There are flip gestures, as well as picking up, tilting and even things like knuckle detection and drawing. All of those are extensively customizable to your liking as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable the so-called Suspend button - it's a virtual key you can move anywhere on the screen, allowing you to expand it to the primary Android keys - Back, Home, Task Switcher, Lock and Close all running apps. It will help you control your phone with just one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, if you fancy operating the Mate S entirely hands-free, Speech aware has you covered. The functionality resembles what we have seen on certain Nexus and Samsung Galaxy devices and boils down to the ability to trigger a voice command, even when the phone is locked and its screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei does this by constantly listening for a "wakeup word", by default "okay emy". Once triggered, the phone wakes up and awaits further voice instructions, like placing a call. Speech awareness is also quite customizable. The wakeup phrase can be changed and you can also train the device to better recognize your voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of accessibility features just goes on and on. Others that deserve mentioning include: glove mode, smart cover and smart headset control. The Mate S even has dual windows apps, just like Samsung's Galaxy Note series. It is a truly convenient way of getting more stuff done by having two active apps on screen simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we should mention Huawei's excellent fingerprint technology implementation. It is superb on both hardware and software level. After quite a few one-on-one races with various handsets in the office, we can definitely say that the Mate S currently has one of the fastest, if not the very best sensors to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works like a charm and managing prints is also a breeze. There is a maximum of 5 distinct ones you can have at any time, but that should be more than enough and the security feature can also be used for locking apps or multimedia content. And just when you thought there wasn't anything else you could possible want from a fingerprint sensor, it turns out there is, as Huawei's new added touchpad functionality gives it yet another interesting twist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We admit, it is more of a gimmick, but scrolling through photos or pulling down the notification shade was surprisingly easy to get used to after a few days with the Mate S, so Huawei might be on to something.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S is powered by a home-brewed HiSilicon Kirin 935 chipset. It is equipped with a total of eight Coretex-A53 processors, four clocked at 2.2 GHz and another four at 1.5 GHz. On paper, this looks like quite an adequate setup by current standards and we can only expect the chip to perform up to par with similar offers from the like of Qualcomm and Huawei.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Huawei has quite an unfortunate track record of putting out underwhelming offers when it comes to its custom chip solutions. We have already seen the Kirin 935 perform inside the Honor 7, as well as its almost identical cousin - the Kirin 930 (slightly underclocked version) inside the Huawei P8 and they did struggle to compete with the crowd in most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, the standard ARM cores inside the chip perform quite as expected, but, the real problem with the custom Kirin 935 is that it features a far-less powerful GPU than those by the competitors. The Mali-T628 MP4 is hardly a powerhouse and we have already seen it hurt graphics performance in all of the aforementioned handsets. The Huawei Mate S finds itself in exactly the same boat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei might have persisted throughout the years with its custom Kirin chipset architecture, but without supplying to other parties, one OEM can hardly offer enough of a basis for performance comparison and implementation evaluation. We've had at least a few Huawei devices come through the office and yet, our database has info on only one other handset with the Kirin 935 chipset - the Honor 7. Naturally, we included it in our benchmark comparisons, but we also threw in a few other Huawei models, to see how Kirin has been developing over time. These include the Huawei Ascend Mate 7, with a Kirin 925 and also the Huawei P8, with its almost identical Kirin 930. We also included the P8lite with its mid-range Snapdragon 615 chip, to see where it fits in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the other chosen competitors, the Huawei P8 happens to sit in a pretty premium price range. With an asking price of about ?600, the phone can currently brush elbows with a lot of other flagship offers, some of them with record-breaking sales, like the Samsung Galaxy S6. And don't get us wrong. We can definitely justify the price, as the Huawei Mate S is a textbook example of a premium device through and through. Still, performance-wise, the Mate S enters into a tough crowd, but, we'll let the benchmarks do the talking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3, which should be straight-forward enough. The eight-core Cortex-A53 setup of the Mate S definitely holds its own, but is still understandably blown away by current flagships like the Galaxy S6 and Z5 Compact. In fact, that is a natural trend all throughout the list of benchmarks that was all but expected. Another reoccurring and quite positive trend is the gradual performance increase across the Kirin range, so Huawei is definitely improving things throughout the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And last, but not least, it is important to note that the Kirin 935 inside the Mate S also consistently outperforms the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, or at least the one inside the Huawei P8. The latter signature mid-range chip has become really popular lately and has had little trouble powering exquisite android experiences and implementations, courtesy of almost every major OEM. The point being, that even though the Kirin 935 is no benchmark-breaker and fails to challenge most current flagships, it still offers more than enough power to handle most every task you can expect from your handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. Here we see pretty much the same arrangement. The Mate S has been bumped down a couple of places due to its poor GPU performance, put the above observations about the evolution of Kirin and more importantly, the Snapdragon 615 comparison, still stand true and are only reaffirmed further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to Basemark OS II, which is a truly all-round benchmark. The octa-core setup of the Kirin 935 really does offer a lot of number-crunching power, as is clearly evident by the multi-core score. The phone also did surprisingly good in the overall chart, but did exhibit some issues during the single core tests, which seemed to have dragged the score down a bit, along with the poor GPU performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the looks of it, the new Android 5.1.1 EMUI 3.1 has some compatibility issues with Basemark OS II (or perhaps it is the other way around) as the app kept on freezing for a few seconds at a particular point in the test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On to pure graphics test, where the Mate S's least favorable hardware trait becomes painfully obvious. It barely churns out enough frames to be on the chart. GPU performance is probably the biggest weak spot of the Mate S. Just like many other otherwise excellent Huawei handsets before it, it is also plagued by the OEM's persistence in bundling chipsets with underwhelming graphics solutions. The Mali-T628 MP4 has sadly proven a popular choice with Huawei. It is found inside the P8, P8max, Honor 6, Honor 6 Plus, Honor 7 and now, the Mate S. Again, it is important to note that the poor GPU choice doesn't affect the smoothness of the GUI, making it less of a concern for many users. But it does make the Mate S a poor choice for Android gaming buffs. You can expect serious frame drops even under light strains.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still can't quite justify why HiSilicon chose to bundle the Kirin 935 with a Mali-T628 MP4 and not at very least the better-performing Mali-T628, found inside the Kirin 925.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>EMUI is definitely one of the better custom Android-based platforms out there with a lot of bells and whistles, nice aesthetics and powerful customization options. However, there are still a few things to be desired from the latest version of Huawei's OS, especially in terms of optimization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back when the first Android Lollipop EMUI was released, we noticed quite a few instances of poor software optimization. Now, despite the move to Android 5.1.1, most of them appear to be still in place. The aforementioned Basemark issues is a prime example and so is the underwhelming performance of the built-in browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, Huawei does preinstall Chrome on its handsets as well. It offers clear-cut performance and stability advantages over the default browser, making it the logical choice for end-users. However, our testing procedure requires us to put the default browser through the hoops and it is kind of an underachiever. Take a look for yourself and definitely steer clear.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S benchmark performance is a mixed bag and not surprisingly, suffering from the choice of custom hardware. This, however, is only part of the story. Kirin chipsets have historically been bundled with rather meager GPU's and this one makes no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>CPU performance however is superb and everyday tasks are a breeze with no noticeable delay or stuttering in the UI. The 3GB of RAM without a doubt help in this respect too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapting EMUI for the Android Lollipop has taken its toll on GPU performance and stability in certain apps, which will hopefully be fixed with future updates. Still, if you are keen on doing a lot of graphics-intensive 3D gaming, the Huawei Mate S shouldn't be your first choice. For most everything else, however, the device feels quite responsive and a pleasure to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S phonebook is laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes. It actually resides in a single application along with the dialer and messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An alphabetical list on the right can help you jump to a specific letter or you can just use the search function. Tapping on a contact brings up a popup with access to a contact's scrollable info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As on most Android launchers, you can input a variety of contact information including custom ringtones and images. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook supports blacklist option for blocking contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S held on to signal excellently and in-call sound was just fine. The proximity sensor makes sure the screen stays off when you hold the phone to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its face while it's ringing would mute the call ringing. Alternatively, picking the phone to your ear while it's ringing, automatically answers the call. A sea of other customizable gestures is also available, as already mentioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary noise cancelling on-board microphone ensures a quieter background for your voice while in call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers. It can also be docked to one side or the other for easy accessibility, or, span the entire lengths of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Mate S through our traditional loudspeaker test and it got a Below Average score, well almost Average to be fair, but still on the quiet side. It falls short when compared to both the Huawei Mate7 and Honor 7, so don't count too much on it at parties.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, or audio recording automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S also comes with Hangouts, which is another way to handle texts. Hangouts can now integrate your SMS and MMS messages in addition to Gtalk and Google+ conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, the Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google now has in their online interface. The default Email app is similar to Gmail, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate S keyboard features some additional settings thanks to its Swype integration, including themes, split keyboard modes, and keyboard height, but sadly many of them are hidden within the input settings menu rather than as shortcuts from the keyboard like on most interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there is support for gestures as well as integration of Google's voice typing with their downloadable language voice recognition packs. There is a sea of options to explore.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Orderly image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the continuous stream of Android updates (now up to 5.1.1 in the Mate S), EMUI 3.1 has retained and borrowed most of its styling and features from its predecessor. The image gallery is a prime example. It still offers a Timeline view, which sorts your images by the date you've taken them. It defaults to the Timeline view, but you can opt for the standard Album view with all of your images sorted in different albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options (including streaming it over DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements (which detects faces automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is very intuitive and packed with options, including things like filters, effects, levels and even special watermarks for time, location, weather, food and mood. Every teenager would be pleased with the selection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it came to playing videos, the Huawei Mate S default player does a good job supporting every common video codec, but unfortunately it lacks support for AC3 audio as is usually the case with most Android phones anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't find a way to load subtitles, but Dolby Mobile enhancement is supported. Not much else, however, is available in terms of options and the player seems kind of basic. It still works great though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S comes with Huawei's custom music player app. It offers four default playlists - songs, artists, albums, folders. You can create your own playlists, too. The background of the app changes dynamically to match the album art, which is a nice little touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics. There are no equalizers to speak off, but the app does have a few extra features. It would try to pull album art, song info and lyrics automatically for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice addition is the ability to filter the songs by length, so no pesky ringtones show up in your library.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed not to find RDS support (Huawei is a frequent offender in this area) - you'll have to name your radio stations by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S didn't start our audio quality test in the best possible manner. Its performance when connected to an active external amplifier was rather bad with frequency response and intermodulation distortion both being far from perfect. Loudness was below average too, so even though we got a few excellent readings elsewhere the overall result is still disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in our standard headphones didn't cause much extra damage - in fact the frequency response slightly improved (but still remained all over the place). The hike in stereo crosstalk was very minor and we didn't get any extra distortion. Unfortunately the starting point was so low that we still can't consider the final products is nowhere near acceptable for a high-end device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei hasn't really been experimenting in the camera department all too much, or at least on paper. 13MP seem to be the sensor of choice lately, with only a few exceptions like the Honor 7 and P8max breaking away from the crowd with higher resolutions. The Mate S follows the same trend and is fitted with a 13MP BSI sensor with, sized at 1/2.6' and an f/2.0 aperture lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But having less pixels at your disposal is definitely no reason to dismiss a camera. Just look at the LG V10, which offers superb quality with 16MP hardware or the universally praised iPhone, which only recently broke the 10MP mark. As any photographer will tell you, there is a lot more to consider and it is all in the details, which the Mate S has plenty of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aforementioned sensor is reportedly equipped with an RGBW array for improved light-gathering capability, highlight rendition in high-contrast scenes and lower noise in low light. There is also optical image stabilization on board, capable of correcting for up to 1.2 degrees of shake. And the camera itself is complimented by a dual-tone LED flash and Sapphire crystal front lens for added protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is a very clean and simple. On each side of the virtual shutter button you get swipe controls that will take you into the photo, video, Light painting, Beauty and Time-lapse modes. To activate the Burst mode you just need to press the camera shutter longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few things have been moved around since previous version of the camera app. On the left side is an advanced menu where you can choose from more shooting modes such as HDR, Panorama and adjust things like object tracking, smile shutter, touch to capture switch, geo-tagging on/off, ISO, white balance, and more. Also the All-focus mode has been moved to this menu and there are modes for document shooting, Super night shots and Watermarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you really want to see the full potential of the camera under your fingertips, there is manual mode, referred to as Pro camera. It offers extensive control over the camera through and through, all organized in a nifty interface, complete with smooth animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can adjust pretty much anything like focus length, ISO, shutter speed and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do have one small grudge with the camera and the viewfinder in particular. It seems to be slightly smaller than the actual photo, which is hardly a problem, unless you are trying to frame something as precise as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all focus mode is similar to Refocus on the Lumia phones - your phone takes a few pictures of the same scene and allows you to choose the focus later, including all in focus. It works nice and hiccup-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S camera captures really decent photos, with plenty of resolved detail, accurate colors and edge to edge sharpness, with a maximum resolution of 4160x3120 pixels. Noise is also kept in check. Overall Shots came out crisp and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode works great too, bringing up even more detail in the shadows, without sacrificing the image quality. The effect is nice and subtle, but it is heavily dependent on the lighting conditions and triggering it sometimes resulted in no effect whatsoever, or an undesired amount of darkening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up close, the Mate S does a pretty good job of focusing as well. Here are a couple of macro photo to prove it. It has no problem focusing from an inch away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RGBW sensor is intended to get the best out of low-light environments and the results are pretty good. We took a few shots after dark and were pleasantly surprised by the level of detail the phone picked up. Noise is also kept at bay quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make things even more-interesting, Huawei has bundled a special Light painting mode in the default camera application. It produces stunning results. No matter how long you take to complete your creation, the rest of the scene seems to stay clear and sharp and doesn't change exposure. Here is some light art we made ourselves (we're not terribly good with this as you can tell). Interestingly, it makes a mirrored image so you can write in front of the camera and the words come out readable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Light trails mode, which operates much like the Light Painting but doesn't reverse images. It captures the scene with the correct exposure and from there it keeps adding the light trails of the passing cars for as long as you like without any risk of overexposing the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has always had a way with panoramas. Mate S takes high-res panorama images, with great stitching, excellent contrast and very good detail levels. It is among the best devices we would pick for panorama purposes, just like the Ascend Mate7 or the P8, bested only by the Apple iPhone 6 series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP front camera produces nice shots with a lot of detail as well. Selfies come out good and the addition of a front-facing LED is really handy to bring in some much needed light at night. The camera app also has a "Beauty mode" enabled by default when you flip to the front camera and it works as advertised, although results are somewhat disturbing. Here are a couple of selfie samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S offers 1080p videos at 30fps. Sadly, there's no 4K recording, although the hardware seems more than capable to handle it (Hopefully, this will finally change with the new Kirin 950 SoC). There is a dedicated viewfinder for clips and, unlike the photo one, it seems to match up with the actual field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored as MP4 files and have a bitrate of around 10Mbps for 1080p resolution, 12 Mbps at most. There's stereo sound at 96Kbps, but the framerate varies quite a bit, though generally stays closer to 29fps than to the pivotal 30.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison the Ascend Mate7 put out a solid 25Mbps 1080p video at 30fps from its 13 MP camera. The Huawei P8 however suffers from the same bitrate limitation as the Mate S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result of the reduced bitrate, videos taken with the Huawei Mate S are quite lacking in detail and sharpness (also like the P8's videos). Once again - the dynamic range is pretty bad and we really expected more resolved detail from such a premium phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample we've uploaded on YouTube for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a  1080p@30fps untouched video (11s ~ 13MB)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S might not shoot the best video around, but it still did quite well in our comparison test. Ever since EMUI 3.1 made its initial move to Android Lollipop with the P8, we have been waiting for a fix for the sub-par video recording quality, but, sadly, it is yet to come. Despite the big jump to Android 5.1.1 found on the Mate S, the phone still underperforms in this area. Once again, until this issue is remedied, we can hardly recommend it based on video recording qualities alone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most droids nowadays, the Huawei Mate S comes with two browsers to handle your web surfing needs. The stock browser offers largely the same functionality as Google's bundled Chrome browser, but we found the latter to be a more capable performer. Chrome also lets you sign in with your Google account and access open tabs and history from other sessions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the highlight of Huawei's homebrewed apps is the Phone Manager. It lets you control all sorts of features from call/message privacy and Do Not Disturb settings, to phone optimization and app permissions, to network and battery usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app features a one-touch optimization feature that frees up memory space and gives you settings recommendations for maximum battery performance. It's quite a slick feature that few manufacturers offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate S comes with WPS Office (apparently Huawei has moved away from Polaris). It handles documents with ease and supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it also opens PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has two tabs that divide your content between categories and a file explorer for internal and external storage. The app also handles ZIP and supports batch operations. It comes with a very useful Safe folder, for fingerprint protected storage. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has included some nifty camera features in the Huawei Mate S, some of which are accessed as individual apps. The Magnifier is especially nifty for looking at stuff up close, while the markedly female-targeted Mirror apps lets you get a quick look at yourself, with included brightness adjustments and zoom options. Also, for some reason, it artificially fogs up when you blow into the microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting camera mode is hosted inside the Director app. With it, you can easily connect up to three additional phones wirelessly and switch between the video streams dynamically as you please while you record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standards, such as calendar, world clock with stopwatch and timer and a calculator. Nothing really special to point out here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notes app does come with voice memo options, which utilizes the Mate's three microphone setup. You can easily switch between a meeting setup, which would require capturing voices from all around, but you can also switch it to interview, which will try to capture only you and your participant and tone out the surroundings. Nifty!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Huawei Mate S comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There seems to be a long-standing trend with Huawei handsets - you generally opt to pick one up for the exquisite looks and premium build at the cost of some overall performance. The idea of offering a flagship grade device and skipping some on the number-crunching power in favor of other redeeming qualities might sound like a recipe for disaster, but Huawei has successfully pulled it off. Things might be set for a quick change, thanks to the upcoming Kirin 950 SoC - the first real performer in HiSilicon's chip portfolio, but for now the OEM is sticking to the well known ingredients and the Mate S is a prime example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has succeeded in producing a high-end device indeed. Aluminum alloy secures the premium looks, matched by excellent handling. The Mate S will get your attention and the build quality won't disappoint in the long run. The phone is also quite generous in the hardware department. Its 5.5 inch FullHD AMOLED screen hits the sweet spot as far as current smartphone size trends go and also offers superb quality with sharp and punchy colors. It is arguably one of the best displays Huawei has put in a device to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader also deserves credit. Overall, it is currently one of the best solutions the industry has to offer. It is blazing fast, always on, very accurate and just a pleasure to use. It also incorporates some additional touchpad features and it all works seamlessly across the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the inside, the custom Kirin 935 SoC is actually capable of a big enough bang, but the Mali-T628 MP4 that Huawei stubbornly insists on is underwhelming. We still don't find QHD resolution screens mandatory these days, but 4K video recording is a more serious blunder by our books. The new EMUI 3.1 definitely looks good on top of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and offers a number of advanced features, but the overall performance just isn't flawless. This is hardly noticeable in the GUI or in everyday tasks, but some more-advanced applications and elaborately detailed games are sure to take their toll on performance. Video recording seems to have some issues as well. Overall, the Mate S has inherited pretty much all issues with spot in the Android 5.0 build of its predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, these shortcomings are far from a deal breaker for the majority of likely users. Hopefully, the OS performance will be tweaked up with a couple of updates, allowing the device to make proper use of its capable hardware. Other than that, there is a lot Huawei deserves credit for. 3GB of RAM are more than enough to breeze through multitasking and the still camera setup is truly impressive and jam-packed with additional hardware and software features to improve the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick summary of our key test findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Huawei Mate S is a solid device all-round, but the fact remains that its hefty price tag puts it in a tough company. The asking price is almost 2015 flagship grade and there's no shortage of viable contenders to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S6 has been around for a few months now and through a combination of aggressive pricing with a few major reductions in the past and the ever-nearing Galaxy S7, now said to come as early as January 2016, you can currently get a pretty good deal on the device. On the other hand, it is still the Korean giant's current flagship offer, boasting a fantastic 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, superb 16MP OIS-enabled camera and the blazing fast Exynos 7420 with a Mali-T760MP8 GPU on board, so it makes no compromises in any performance department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And for a more direct size alternative there is the Galaxy A7. Although it is essentially a mid-range offer, it doesn't really fall short of the Mate S in terms of performance. You also sacrifice little in the way of a stylish and high-quality metal exterior. Last, but definitely not least, if you are after something with a bit more screen real estate and a lot more productivity features - the Note series might be just right for you. The latest and greatest Note5 might be a little outside the Mate S budget, but the Note 4 is a perfect fit. You can't really go wrong with a spacious 5.7-inch QHD Super AMOLED display - the same one inside the Note5 or the Snapdragon 805 SoC with 3GB of RAM, as long as you are up for the extra bulk, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also happens that Samsung is not the only OEM with reasonably priced flagship offer at hand. The LG G4 for instance is an excellent device that can be picked up on a great deal. It also has no shortage of style with a twist of its own - a curved body and leather back (which you should definitely opt for). And, if you prefer a Vanilla Android device, the LG-made Nexus 5x is within the Mate S budget too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OnePlus 2 is worth looking into, if you are into the hip part of the Chinese market and don't potentially mind the hustle of acquiring an invite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola's latest batch of Moto devices is also a pretty good choice, although you are sacrificing the aesthetic appeal that the Mate S holds for something a bit more classic-looking, but not necessarily worse. The 5.5-inch Moto X Play seems to be the most direct counterpart to the Huawei at hand, but it also turns out you can opt for the bigger and more-powerful X Style flagship and still stay within budget. It, on the other hand, definitely has a hardware edge with a QHD resolution and a Snapdragon 808 SoC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S is arguably one of the most stylish and elegant devices to pass through the office in recent memory. It is built to high standards and its stylish exterior and premium feel will get it quite a lot of attention. Well-equipped as well, it is sure to please the majority of Android users, who value quality exterior and rich functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if you are keen on specs and would like to squeeze every last drop of processing power out of your handset, the Huawei Mate S, like most of its siblings, shouldn't really be your first option. Its price tag might be justified to some extent, considering the premium materials and build, but it throws it amidst a less than favorable flagship crowd. The truth is you can pick up a more versatile device for the price, but you would have to look pretty hard to find one that is nearly as stylish.</paragraph>
