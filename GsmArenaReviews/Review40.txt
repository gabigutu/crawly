			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designers must love working for the LG GD series. It?s the place to get some bizarre and exotic features ? from transparent keypads to a wristwatch. The LG GD880 Mini is perhaps among the more mainstream options but it?s no less keen to impress. LG have been distilling the touch phone again and again and the Mini is their latest and seemingly most mature effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG CEO says the Mini was designed in response to consumer requests. Reportedly, people wanted a phone that?s not too big, too expensive or too complicated. Well, ladies and gentlemen, here?s what you ordered, meet the Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might be wondering what?s with the ?Mini? moniker. In all honesty, the Mini is small compared to the LG BL40 New Chocolate but it?s not a tiny phone. For all we know, it?s neat and compact, a sophisticated and feature-rich LG Pop really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD880 Mini distances itself from the current smartphone craze and sticks to LG own S-Class OS. Every element of the interface is carefully and artfully designed, with shading and gloss, with rich and vibrant colors that look great on the pixel-dense screen. The homescreen is trying to mimic the Android depth of field and the GD880 Mini features full multitasking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GD880 Mini at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright then, it?s a complete feature set on the LG GD880 Mini. The best screen resolution around, DivX/XviD support and Dolby mobile make for a great multimedia experience, the web browser handles Flash and pinch-zooming and there?s a document viewer to top it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we?ve got here is a nicely working LG Mini, but you should keep in mind it?s a pre-release sample we?re dealing with here so chances are the design and software may undergo some changes before final release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we?ve taken that off our chest, flip to the next page for the scheduled hardware inspection of the LG GD880 Mini.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GD880 Mini 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD880 Mini is smaller than the highly popular LG KP500 Cookie, yet it packs a 3.2? display ? bigger than the Cookie?s. The GD880 Mini measures 102 x 47.6 x 10.6 mm and weighs 99 grams and it?s very comfortable to hold. It?s the thinnest touch phone by LG (it beats the LG BL40 New Chocolate by a whisker) though it?s not quite the thinnest on the market ? the Toshiba TG01 has the title here with its mere 9.9 mm worth of girth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The blocky design is a love it or hate it type of deal ? some will appreciate its rigid simplicity, while others will scoff at it for being too ?square?.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD880 Mini is consciously minimalist in design, all square angles and straight lines and the same goes for the paint job ? brush metal and black plastic. The front is in tune with the overall simplicity and its most prominent feature is the display. There?s not a single key on the front of the Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece covered by a fine metal mesh and the video-call camera, both placed on a strip of brushed metal. Bellow that on the black bezel around the screen, there?s a proximity sensor that switches off and locks the screen automatically during a call and an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clean line on the left side of the phone is only broken by the volume rocker. The right side accommodates the shutter key and the microSD card slot. The microSD slot is sealed with a sliding cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the phone are made of metal with long thin grooves. The buttons bulge slightly but have the same finish to blend in with their surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the 3.5mm audio jack, a covered microUSB port and the Power/Lock key. Both are easy to access and nice to use. The Power/Lock button is slightly raised to make it easier to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom houses the loudspeaker grill and the mic hole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From behind, the LG GD880 Mini looks more like a small black box than a mobile phone. The LG logo at the bottom and the 5-megapixel camera lens in the top left corner are the only things breaking up the soft rubbery plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That plastic on the back feels really nice to the touch but it collects a massive collection of fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is quite lonely in its corner ? just a ?5 MEGA? label below it ? and it?s left to fend for itself. There is no flash and no lens protection ? the glass of the camera is slightly inset into the back hardly providing any protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover comes off easily in a slide to open fashion. It holds firmly though, no wobbles or creaks. Underneath is a 900 mAh Li-Ion battery and the SIM card compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The square angles, the straight lines, the brushed metal ? the LG GD880 Mini has all the appearances of a cigarette case. We don?t mean that in a bad way ? just Google ?cigarette case? and you?ll find thousands of cases with intricate patterns etched into them, it?s a fashion accessory in its own right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there?s another way to look at it ? you?ll often read that this or that is the new black, but clean black exterior is always fashionable, just ask Prada or Hugo Boss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether you see it as a sleek, expensive-looking gadget or a fashion accessory that completes your outfit, the LG GD880 Mini looks right in every setting. We only wish there was more consistency n the materials and finishes used on the phone exterior. There are at least four of those used and they follow any pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not all looks though ? the phone is very solid, with just enough weight, so it?s very easy to imagine that it was cut out as one whole piece from a slab of metal. It has the feel of a luxury item, which no amount of software or number-crunching in the specs can achieve (though that high pixel count certainly helps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GD880 Mini, true to its name, fits easily in the hand and in the pocket.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Widescreen, touchscreen, cool screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The screen of a touch-operated phone today is the viewport to a lot more than just a phone ? the touchable interface for one, but also photos, videos and the whole Internet. And the display on the LG GD880 Mini is one of the finest we?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16:9 aspect ratio is quickly pushing out 4:3 in TVs, computer screens and phones. Widescreen multimedia content is steadily catching up and with the GD880 Mini media is a big part of how the phone?s used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is is quite nice. Blacks are not as good as AMOLED but are great for a TFT unit. Sunlight legibility is not on an iPhone level, but it?s pretty close (easily the best among LG touch phones) and the touchscreen registers even the lightest taps. The high-resolution screen renders a crisp, vivid picture that bests a lot of its competitors. The scratch-resistant glass of the screen as seen on the LG GB40 New Chocolate makes an appearance hear as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching videos and browsing photos is a treat and text remains legible at very low zoom levels, which is great for web browsing of full-featured web sites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Updated S-Class, brand new homescreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S-Class UI has already earned its place among feature phone user interfaces today. Since the first S-Class device ? the LG KM900 Arena ? the BL40 New Chocolate was the only one to bring some changes in both functionality and looks. LG GD880 Mini continues with the improvements with even bolder decisions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remember the Cube interface ? the homescreen base in all previous S-Class handsets? It?s now gone ? the four homescreens are now replaced by one extended desktop that nods at Android. It?s three times the size of the display (side-scrollable), giving you enough room to organize all the items you want to put up front. And there are plenty of things that can go up there. The screen shows you one third of the actual homescreen and you can sweep left or right to get to the other panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add different items on the homescreen with the dedicated virtual key in the bottom right corner of the display. In edit mode you can also shake the phone to auto align all the stuff on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re about to add a new item you will first have to choose between widget, bookmark or shortcut. The widgets are similar to what we?ve already seen in previous S-Class handsets, some of them with small visual changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides widgets, you can also put bookmarks or shortcuts to almost anything in your phone. They look exactly like the iPhone?s icons and work in a similar way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A shortcut to the Task manager is always available in the bottom left corner of the screen, except on the homescreen where it is replaced by the green receiver key. This time around, the task manager is more user-friendly and resembles Symbian by popping up at the bottom to show the running apps. You can terminate or switch between the currently running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the bottom right corner of the screen you will always find a red receiver button. In addition to its main purpose, it will also terminate any app you are currently using and take you back to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have got it right again and the S-class interface is as visually impressive as before, and perhaps more mature. Everything from homescreen to dropdown menus roll, sweep in, unfold and rotate extra smoothly with a responsiveness that suggests some powerful graphics acceleration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the "Press &amp; Hold to Unlock" kind, which is the same as in the LG Arena, Viewty Smart and the Crystal. In addition, the Mini has gesture lock too. You can assign up to 9 shortcuts to different phone features ? contacts, call log, alarms, music, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Status bar at the top of the screen launches a semitransparent menu that can be used to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off, change profiles and view recent events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. It has the usual layout of four rows of menu items, which are scrollable horizontally. That way, almost all menu items are accessible simultaneously without jumping tabs, as in older LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the accelerometer doesn?t kick in to automatically rotate the main menu as it did in previous S-Class phones, and even the LG Pop. This might get fixed in the retail unit though, or it was simply disabled because of the uneven number of items on every row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, March 29: We have three new screenshots for you ? as you can see, the latest iteration of the S-Class interface for the LG GD880 Mini is shaping up great. We haven?t had the chance to test them yet, this will have to wait for the review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social networking makes it on the S-Class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG has finally added native Twitter and Facebook clients on the S-Class. They are nicely touch optimized and have the same look and functionality as the respective apps for the iPhone and Symbian.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multi-touch gallery as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD880 Mini offers two gallery modes depending on the handset's orientation. In portrait mode images and videos are displayed in a grid sorted by date, type or name, while in landscape mode you get a nice spatial view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape 3D gallery has been changed yet again since the LG BL40 New Chocolate. While in the original S-class interface you only had three images visible at a time, the BL40 had a lot more with options to change the viewing angle and zoom level. Now the Mini shows only 5 pictures at a time within a virtual arc containing all the images in your handset. There are no viewing options available or different arcs sorted by month. Performance-wise it's really ok - it's as fluid as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the multi-touch enabled capacitive touchscreen, you can zoom in on images with the pinching gesture that you may have seen on the iPhone or the HTC Hero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opened images also rotate automatically thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the standard options in the standard gallery such as rename, delete, print, send and info, there is also a slideshow mode. You can choose the time interval, the display order (shuffle or not) and the transition effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cool music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has also been changed since the last time we saw it in the BL40 New Chocolate. It now has an independent ?now playing? screen with a nice spinning vinyl for visualization. It uses the album art if available, or a default cover if not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone sideways takes you into landscape mode where you have all tracks in a cover flow similar to the iPhone?s. In both modes you have the usual music controls at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer settings are also available. While most of them are pretty standard, you surely will notice the Dolby Mobile, so typical of LG.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has full DivX/XviD support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the music player brings no functional changes, the video player is a big surprise. It now supports all kind of DivX and XviD videos up to WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It managed to play all the DivX/XviD movies we threw at it with no dropped frames or any kind of problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dolby Mobile is available in the video player too and is turned on by default. And just so you know, its potential is best appreciated on the headphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG insist on 5 megapixels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GD880 Mini sports a 5 megapixel camera. It's capable of taking photos with maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels and offers geotagging, face tracking, manual focus and smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mini comes with the same camera interface as the Viewty Smart and the Arena. Access to all the camera settings is via the left taskbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for exposure compensation, digital zoom, focus mode (auto/macro) and advanced settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GD880 Mini Advanced settings camera menu is a nifty rotating dial ( style) with the available options for each setting displayed as a list on the right. The interface is very handy, neat and usable. In the advanced settings you will find ISO options, white balance, color effects, picture size, extra focus settings, scenes, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another bar on the right hand-side of the screen. It offers a virtual shutter key, along with an exit and a gallery button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more than decent picture quality for a pre-production managed to surprise us. The colors on the sample images are very lively and accurate. The automatic ISO is quite precise and the picture detail is good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full-res samples below revealed signs of more aggressive noise reduction in the shadows and the sky. There's also noticeable corner softness, which is usually suggests a low quality lens but it may as well be our early sample only. The colors also have a greenish color cast but we think that will also be fixed in the final unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the video is quite disappointing, just as it was with the BL40 camcorder. The GD880 Mini does VGA videos at 15fps at this point, and we hope the overall quality and framerate might improve in the retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser supports Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Mini web browser is identical to what previous S-Class devices offered. Unfortunately, scrolling and panning hasn?t improved a bit since.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the pinch zoom also works in the browser. LG have done a good job here but the actual zooming is a bit more fluid in the image gallery than it is in the browser. Still it?s better than the previous S-class phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loading speeds are not enviable though. Over Wi-Fi, the LG Mini browser takes twice the time to fully load a page than the iPhone 3G and you can't really pan around while the page is still loading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls are found at the top of the screen and don't auto-hide. The only option to make them disappear is to turn on the full screen view from the browser menu or flip the phone landscape. Then the accelerometer comes into play and does its job pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the features include support for multiple pages, visual history and search-on-page. There is Flash support too and YouTube is nearly as good as on desktop.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mini sure is a name that carries similar connotations as Cookie and Pop. But that?s absolutely misleading. We?re talking different horsepower here and a phone cool like Mini Cooper. The LG GD880 Mini seems to believe that the best design is no design and has the cool urban feel of a gadget you can trust and show off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the Mini has everything you may want in a feature phone ? a full connectivity package, fancy UI with lots of goodies, really capable media players, decent camera, and GPS. The brilliant screen is perhaps the first thing to get attention and it may as well convince you this neat little package is not too willing to compromise on style and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compromises are inevitable of course ? the Mini has a flashless camera, poor video, inadequate built-in storage, etc. But after all, it looks likely to succeed in its main objective: take the Pop and Cookie to the next level and offer more advanced users a better all-round experience. The first to come with the new LG Air sync service and social networking support, the Mini even has an advantage over its S-Class siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We find it hard not to like the Mini at this point even if it doesn?t bring innovation. It will sure have to stand another trial in a full review and we?d be glad to have it back.</paragraph>
