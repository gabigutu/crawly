			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A stylish and durable steel body, compact size and smartphone skill, the Nokia 6700 slide looks strong enough to hold its own in a modern world. Touchscreen, Android and whatnot have forced a sea change and many fear Symbian to have lost some of its mojo. It still has its strongholds of course ? it seems the Eseries and Nseries will never fall out of users? favor. But where does that leave an affordable midrange smartphone like the 6700 slide?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Affordable may as well be the key word here. We?re looking at an easy-going, eye-catching phone that wants to have mass appeal. It?s got some big shoes to fill too ? its bar-shaped sibling was one of the best appreciated Nokia handsets last year. Adding smart to what was a pretty cool phone already seems like the next logical move. But let?s see if the 6700 slide is the right package for the right market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide brings enough updates to justify its existence ? smartphone skill, an audio jack and video-calling are there to address some of the main grudges we had with the 6700 classic. Gaps in the spec sheet are prominent enough though. GPS is perhaps irrelevant to the intended users but Wi-Fi will certainly be missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, somewhere along the way of translating the 6700 classic to a slider form factor something must have gone wrong with the design language. Perhaps the only way to properly say that is we would have liked it better if the 6700 slide looked more like the 6600i slide and less like Wall-E. But whatever, design has always been a subjective thing so we?ll leave the biting comments aside for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead we?ll focus on the Nokia 6700 slide ergonomics right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reasonable retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide is dressed to impress but the retail package obviously had to keep within price limits. Not that anything essential is missing, but there?s nothing too fancy either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the box, you will find a 2GB microSD card and that tiny Nokia microUSB cable that extends to no more than 5cm. Of course you also get a charger and a rather cheap looking one-piece headset that ends on a 2.5mm jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6700 slide 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide is a bit bigger than the classic version, measuring 95.2 x 46.1 x 15.9 mm and 52 cc of volume. But despite the added millimeters around the waistline, (it?s a slider after all) it will still fit easily into any pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively heavy weight of 110 grams gives the 6700 slide the same solid feel we enjoyed in its bar-shaped predecessor. That?s one thing about those two phones that makes them a joy to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When Nokia first announced the 6700 slide we were less than impressed with all those bright and flashy paintjobs. We do appreciate the fact though, that they are likely to make the phone a popular choice among youngsters. Anyway, we?re working with the silver version and we?re more than happy with the the finish of the device (but only that, not the overall design).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed photos, be it official promo pictures or live shots, rarely do the Nokia 6700 slide justice. It may lack the geeky appeal of touch-phones with huge colorful screens, but it?s exactly the solid and reliable, no-nonsense handset that many users will just love.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the phone is closed the display takes about two-thirds of its front panel. To say it up front, the screen is small. Neither the QVGA resolution nor the 2.2? diagonal is worth cheers but image quality isn?t too bad. The brightness levels of the TFT unit are pretty high, contrast is unimpressive though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With displays like the Samsung Super AMOLED around, it?s hard to get excited about the modest (at best) screen of the Nokia 6700 slide. Still, if have to name one area where the 2.2? screen stands its ground against the best it would be sunlight legibility. That?s where Nokia have an excellent record and we?re glad the 6700 slide is up to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ample D-pad is dead center on the navigational pad below the screen along sided by six other keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation pad is made of metal but the two round buttons and the D-pad are plastic. All keys are decently sized and produce nice, satisfying clicks when pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the Nokia 6700 slide display are the video-call camera and the ambient light sensor, placed on either side of the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset features the dedicated camera key. It?s got distinct half and full press but is too slim and plasticky. It definitely does a good job at focusing and capturing all snapshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone is where the microphone pinhole is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the Nokia 6700 slide is completely bare. There?s no volume rocker on this one, but you can use the D-pad instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no less than four apertures at the top of the phone. The lanyard eyelet is located on the left, followed by the 2.5mm audio jack. We would have appreciated the more popular 3.5mm solution here but it?s still better than the 6700 classic, which had no standard jack at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the microUSB port, hidden under a plastic cover. The Nokia 6700 slide can charge off a microUSB connection so you have two options here instead of one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the microUSB port under the lid is the battery cover latch. It's somewhat of an inconvenience that you need to pop the port cover open every time you remove the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other charging option is, of course the traditional Nokia charger plug, which is the last thing of interest at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the slider reveals the 12-key alphanumeric keypad. It?s the flatbed type and does look cheap and flimsy. However, aside from the insufficient headroom for the topmost row of buttons, the keypad does quite a good job. The keys are large enough and sufficiently spaced. Tactile orientation and, especially, the good press feedback make a positive overall impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our trip of the Nokia 6700 slide hardware at the rear panel. This is where the 5 megapixel camera lens is located, along with the dual-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover lays the microSD card slot, which handled a 16GB microSD card with ease. You will need to remove the back panel to get to the card slot, but you still have the option to hot-swap cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide is powered by an 860 mAh Li-Ion BL-4CT battery, which is quoted at up to 300 hours of stand-by or up to 4 hours of talk-time. Those are hardly spectacular numbers but its real life performance ain?t half bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a few minutes of telephony and about an hour of fiddling with the other features of the phone each day, the Nokia 6700 slide lived though almost four full days and that was a pleasant surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general feel about the Nokia 6700 slide materials and sliding mechanism is very positive. The nice all-metal finish is nice to feel in your palm and there are hardly any usability compromises. While not among the most beautifully designed sliders around, the Nokia 6700 slide is still an excellent package that is very comfortable to use and carry around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide, unlike its classic sibling, runs Symbian 9.3 OS with S60 3rd edition user interface with Feature Pack 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the homescreen there?s the Contact bar, which we first saw in the Nokia 5630. It?s an row of select contacts that add to the usual shortcuts and panels of the Symbian S60 Active standby homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The favorite contacts are placed on top, each represented by the contact photo and their first name. Four contacts are visible at a time and you can scroll left and right for the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the Contacts list, it's pretty much standard Active Standby. There are up to three panels, but the third slot is always occupied by the ?Share your photos?, so you only get to choose two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three options ? Calendar, email notifications and Ovi Contacts. There?s also a music player panel, which shows up when there?s a song playing (if the Ovi Contacts is enabled, it?s hidden while the music player panel is visible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar panel shows the most recent upcoming appointment in the calendar. The email panel shows the number of unread messages and sender and Re: field of the most recent message. The Ovi Contacts panel shows your status and number of friends online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the panels are up to 6 shortcuts to applications and you can assign shortcuts to the left and right soft keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old Active Standby layouts are still here and include Basic - you can assign shortcuts to the D-pad, Horizontal icons bar - the old Active Standby and, finally, the Vertical icons bar, which has only tabs (shortcuts, calendar, music player and personalization) but doesn't hide much of the wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all Symbian phones, there is a built-in voice recognition system. It does a good job, being fully speaker-independent and recognizing a fairly high percentage of our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager appears on every pop-up menu. It's actually placed on top of every list, which can be a little irritating at times, considering you can still invoke it with the well-known shortcut of pressing and holding the Menu key (the one with the House pictogram).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide is powered by a 600MHz CPU, which might sound like a slow CPU in the world of Snapdragons, but it?s high for Symbian standards. The UI is zippy and multitasking isn?t a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception is great on the Nokia 6700 slide. The phone has good in-ear sound quality with loud sound and good signal reception. Vibration is also strong enough to make sure you never miss an incoming call or message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant surprise was the smart dialing feature, which is usually reserved for the Eseries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results from our loudspeaker test are at your disposal - Nokia 6700 slide turned out to be a very good performer in this respect. Check out the table showing how it stacks up beside some of the handsets we've put to the same test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is robust<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian handsets have an excellent phonebook with virtually unlimited capabilities. There is storage space for a practically unlimited number of contacts and fields with all the available memory potentially usable for the purpose. Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Personal ringtones and videos can also be assigned to a contact. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization is also nice and easy although you do need the Ovi Suite for things to go smoothly. Sending and receiving contacts via SMS or Bluetooth is also a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log application on the Nokia 6700 slide is as pedantic as the other Symbian call logs. It holds up to 20 call records in each of the tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls. These are all accessed by pressing the Call key on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enter the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers over the air or even over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide has very good messaging capabilities. With a decent keypad and great software support managing your correspondence is as good as it gets on this kind of devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6700 slide supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The SMS and MMS share an editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very similar to what previous Symbian powered phones have offered. The app can automatically detect the settings for over 1000 email service providers, all you have to do is enter your email address and password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we had some issues with it ? we had to enter the settings manually for our Gmail test account to get it working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for attachments, signatures and basically most of the things you can think of, so the Nokia 6700 slide can meet almost any requirement regarding the user's emailing needs. Unfortunately, there?s no preinstalled document viewer on the 6700 slide, so you?ll need to snatch one off the Ovi Store to view attached office files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Contacts chats with Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts app comes preinstalled with Nokia 6700 slide but you can also install it on most other Nokia smartphones. It integrates tightly with the Contact list and you can easily switch between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are synced with the Ovi cloud (along with calendar items and notes) and they can either be existing Ovi Contacts or G-Talk users (that?s Google?s own IM service, which is also integrated into Gmail).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts can also be used to share the name and artist info for the track you?re currently listening to. It can share your location too, but you?d need to connect an external GPS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you probably don?t have many contacts using Ovi for chat, chances are that quite a few of them have a Gmail account and they can use that to chat with you. They could use iGoogle too or a desktop client like G-Talk. Multi-protocol clients can usually handle G-Talk too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is good, but the 6700 slide is not a music phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s little diversity is Symbian music players ? the one on the Nokia 6700 slide is the exact same one found on XpressMusic devices (not that that?s a reason to complain in this case). It handles the most common audio formats - MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide is hardly what we?d call a music-oriented device though. The audio plug is the 2.5mm type, not exactly the most common variety. Plus, there are no dedicated music control keys on the 6700 slide body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can be minimized to play in background. A panel shows up on the stand-by screen and indicates the currently running track. It can also be used for skipping songs and even fast-forwarding and rewinding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, this takes care of controlling the music and the lack of dedicated music keys is not a huge loss, but not having a volume rocker is quite annoying. You have to switch to the music player each time you want to adjust the volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorting your songs by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing of the desired name is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is worth noting that the Nokia 6700 slide is supposed to play music up to 29 hours on a single charge ? an impressive number given that the battery has just 860mAh capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets and, should they seem insufficient, you can edit them or create new ones in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Remarkable audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide has excellent audio output, with no weak points whatsoever. It may not be the loudest handset on the market but the tracks you are listening to will sound exactly as they were meant to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The readings in our audio quality test were as good as (or almost as good as) we have seen from a mobile phone. Not that we haven't been impressed with all Nokia handsets that we have tested recently, but the 6700 slide is certainly one of the best performers. We are very pleased that Nokia made no compromises here despite the relatively low price tag of the device and lack of 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player works<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6700 slide features Real player (as Symbians typically do) and the Video center for playing your video clips in both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such a small screen though, video playback is not this phone's strongest suit. And to confirm that you'll need to install a third-party player if you want some taste of DivX/XviD video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and Visual radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia 6700 slide has a nice simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. RDS support is included and the Visual radio is also on-board. If internet connection is available, the Visual radio application can download all the local stations and save them to the handset with their names.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nseries-grade image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery was a pleasant surprise - it's the same as the one found in Nokia's N-Series phones and looks great. The speed of photo browsing increases if you press and hold the direction buttons on the D-pad. This allows quick skipping of tons of files if you're not in the habit of sorting out your memory card regularly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike, say, the Nokia N85, zooming here is very speedy, thanks to the zippy 600MHz processor. It does slow down a bit when you get over 100% but it will go up to 400% zoom. Zooming is done in small increments (about 10%) and panning is quite fast too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is impressive, video ? not<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide is equipped with a 5 megapixel autofocus camera with Carl Zeiss lens and a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. It sports a dual-LED flash but no lens protection whatsoever. This means that the large glass covering the lens is prone to finger smudges and perhaps the occasional scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as settings go, the camera on 6700 slide is limited, although it offers several scene presets, one of which is user defined. There's limited control over light sensitivity (it has low, medium, high and auto settings) as well as some control over sharpness and contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bar on the right side of the screen hosts a set of shortcuts to select choice of the camera settings. You can add and remove shortcuts so you can have quick access to the settings that matter to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the settings include flash control, self-timer (2, 10, 20 seconds), night mode, automatic panorama mode and multi shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an option to capture consecutive images separated by a predefined interval (from 10 seconds to 30 minutes). You can also add color effects (sepia, negative, black and white, vivid) to the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously there aren?t any fancy features such as face and smile detection or dynamic range optimizations but the the Nokia 6700 slide delivers some seriously wicked image quality. It easily ranks the phone among the best 5 megapixel cameraphones on the market. The photos have pleasing colors and good contrast with the noise levels still remaining pretty good. The amount of resolved detail is also among the best we have seen on a 5 megapixel phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the 6700 slide. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the Nokia 6700 slide shoots in VGA resolution at 15 fps captured in MPEG-4 format. Although this is a decent achievement, the quality is quite poor actually. The modest frame-rate takes the fun out of the higher VGA resolution and makes the videos unsuitable for viewing on a larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the colors of the videos shot with the Nokia 6700 slide are pretty nice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfer options are numerous on the Nokia 6700 slide. Every common network data transfer medium is supported and so are USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6700 slide also packs support for HSDPA and HSUPA but, sadly, not for Wi-Fi. There isn?t any GPS receiver as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a microSD card slot and although it?s positioned under the battery cover, you don?t have to remove the battery itself to get to it. We tested it with a 16GB card and it worked just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audiophiles won?t be glad hearing this, but the 6700 slide has no 3.5mm audio jack. It sports a 2.5mm jack instead which is less popular.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A bigger screen would?ve fitted better the great browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet with the Nokia 6700 slide, like with all Nokia smartphones, is a pleasant experience. Even the most elaborate pages are rendered well and finding your way around them is a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point as it is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help you find your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required. The zoom level is also easily adjustable and searching for text on a page is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large amount of RAM (128MB in this case) is surely one of the best things that could happen to the browser, as it is clearly one of the most RAM-intensive applications. Now, even if you load very heavy web pages and have a few applications running in the background, you are extremely unlikely to run out of free RAM on the Nokia 6700 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser also has full support for Flash and Java content so you should have no problem watching content found on the Internet. YouTube videos embedded in webpages can even be set to play fullscreen, which is a nice option since otherwise they rarely fit onto a QVGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The setback of the Nokia 6700 slide web browser is the smallish display. Only 2.2 inches means the smallest fonts aren't always readable and you have to go for larger ones. This in turn limits the amount of text that can fit on screen and will force you to scroll even more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The time-management skills of Nokia 6700 slide, like most other Symbian handsets, are really good. Just name the application and you can bet the handset has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start exploring the rich application package with the calendar. It has five different types of view - monthly, weekly, daily, Agenda and To-do, and five types of events available for setting up ? Meeting, Meeting request, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Every event has its own unique fields, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the Nokia 6700 slide doesn?t have any preinstalled document viewer so you need to snatch one off the Ovi Store in order to view Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6700 slide sports a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The Active Notes application is also on board allowing multimedia content to be added to your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set a huge number of alarms, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management options (which even include sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and it's a safe bet that the file manager can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also aboard the Nokia 6700 slide. The application itself finds almost every item in your handset containing a given keyword. From messages to landmarks, every bit of data is checked and then all results are displayed on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide also comes with Ovi Files. You have to install an application on your computer but after that's done, you can access all the files on that computer from your phone or a browser on another computer. You also get "Anytime files", which lets you store 10GB of data online that is accessible even if the computer is turned off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even if the 6700 slide has no GPS receiver, it has the Ovi Maps preinstalled. You can browse the maps, look up addresses, plan routes, but you'll have to do without voice guided navigation. It won't even approximate your location based on Cell-ID triangulation like Google Maps does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the games, the Nokia 6700 features only one preloaded game, the well known Bounce Tales. Luckily, the Ovi Store is just a few clicks away and there you can find plenty of games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the Ovi Store, it?s easily accessible right off the phone as well as from a desktop browser. Again, you can download the apps straight to your smartphone or from your desktop computer and transfer them later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple ? the general view lists apps with their names and category, plus the price and stars rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, gives you more details - a description, storage footprint plus reviews by people who have tried it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 slide is for those users who are considering a smartphone for the first time. If you need a phone that does browsing, email, social networking and media within budget, this might be the thing for you. But if you just can't be bothered and simply want your phone pink, or blue, or lime, the 6700 slide is still at your service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another point in favor of the Nokia 6700 slide is that there aren't exactly plenty of alternatives for what it offers. A few years back, the 6700 slide would've run head on against the likes of Samsung U900 Soul. Today, Samsung are too caught in touchscreen to care. All they have that comes close to the Nokia 6700 slide is the S5550 Shark. It sure has an AMOLED screen (of the same size and resolution) but in the end it's a plasticky dumbphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S5550 Shark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S6700, for instance, has the advantage of a larger screen, but it lacks the smartphone capabilities, too. And the 3 megapixel camera sure tips the scales in favor of the 6700 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S6700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 is another relic of the olden days. It has a Cyber-shot camera to rival the Carl-Zeiss certified optics of the Nokia 6700 slide. For a more up-to-date opposition, there's the Sony Ericsson Hazel. It's armed to the teeth with WLAN, sat-nav and a bigger screen but we guess it will be way more expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson C903</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't help but note that in-house competition looks more threatening really. The Nokia 6700 classic is well in the picture, never mind its age. We actually feel it has the upper hand and if smartphone isn't a must, the value for money is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6700 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are willing to compromise a little, you should definitely check out the Nokia C5. It might have shed some of the metal off to bring the price down, but adds GPS with free lifetime voice navigation. In the end, you get a reasonably good-looking handset with more functionality for less cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C5</paragraph>
