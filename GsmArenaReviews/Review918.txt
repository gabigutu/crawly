			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You know what they say - three is a crowd. On a second thought though, no one here's got romance on their mind. The three-horse race has had its highs and lows, but it's the playoffs and we got a front-row seat. It's not about heroes and villains anymore, everyone's a bit of both. Each phone here will look at the other two and see the worst of both worlds. Now, can we keep a cool head and try and see the whole picture?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing's certain, the Apple iPhone 5s, the LG G2 and the Nokia Lumia 1020 just don't mix. The three platforms are usually targeting a completely different set of users. But each of these gadgets is the best of its species and that's the cross section of everything the industry has to offer at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple's iPhone 5s has just hit the shelves, setting a new sales record to be broken yet again a year from now. It looks the same as iPhone 5, but is powered by a brand new 64-bit A7 chip and runs the impressively redesigned iOS 7. Easily the standard-setting touch interface has just got better and the content Apple users have access to is second to none.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5s over the LG G2 and Nokia Lumia 1020:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is the top Android smartphone at the moment (this may as well be the most precarious position of them all, considering the rate at which droid flagships are released). But still, the timing is spot-on and the G2 being what it is has nothing to do with luck. LG has equipped it with the latest Snapdragon 800 chipset, a massive 1080p display and Android 4.2. They didn't shy away from experimenting either, and the result is nothing short of impressive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G2 over the iPhone 5s and Nokia Lumia 1020:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia Lumia 1020 is the most powerful Windows Phone smartphone and by far the best cameraphone, with a 41MP camera sensor, optical image stabilization, xenon and LED, and even 4x lossless zoom. The video recording is limited to 1080p@30fps, but thanks to the HAAC microphones and the lossless 4x zoom you can even film at concerts without compromising the audio or video quality. The Lumia 1020 also has an AMOLED display and a premium polycarbonate unibody, while Windows Phone 8 has an unmatched office package and Nokia's free lifetime voice-guided navigation that also works offline.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020 over the Apple iPhone 5s and LG G2:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not like each of those phones is only as good as its weakest spot, but it's not as straightforward either as simply praise this one's camera, that one's app store or the other one's full-HD screen. This can easily get out of control and into a three-ring circus, but we're gonna give it a try anyway.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Exterior and build<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s, LG G2 and Nokia Lumia 1020 span the entire range of screen size and resolution available in the premium segment. From a design standpoint, each device is playing to its strengths - and weaknesses. LG did impressively well to fit a massive screen at the front with almost no such thing as bezel, flipping over all hardware buttons to the back. Nokia on the other hand, had to accommodate a huge camera module and avoid a massive bulge. The flip side is it's still a humongous phone for the screen size. Apple's iPhone, on the other hand, is the most compact and lightweight premium smartphone but falling behind in terms of screen size and resolution is an issue Cupertino will have to address sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was the obvious goal of Nokia, Apple and LG to give their respective flagship the best treatment in terms of build and finish but all three handsets are actually improving on traditional designs rather than inventing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s has the styling, build and finfish of the now four-year-old iPhone 4. Aiming for the same, yet better is what Apple stands for and the iPhone 5s is the living proof. The single difference to last year's iPhone 5 is the good old Home key, which this time integrates a fingerprint scanner under a piece of sapphire glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 too is recycling a familiar design from the LG Optimus G Pro phablet. The massive, almost bezel-free screen accommodates the Android navigation controls, while the power/lock key and the volume rocker have been reocated at the back, right at the user's very fingertips. The downside of the LG G2 is the glossy plastic finish which gets covered in fingerprints in no time and is not an easy surface to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The polycarbonate unibody of the Lumia 1020 premiered a while back on the MeeGo-powered N9.It has been used since on the premium smartphones in the Lumia line. The obvious difference is the prominent hump around the camera. Being a camera-centric device, the Lumia 1020 is the only one of the three to feature a hardware shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5S has a single hardware key at the front, the LG G2 has none, while the Lumia 1020 features the usual set of three capacitive keys below the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three phones have the battery sealed within the body and no memory expansion. The SIM card compartments are side mounted, nano-SIM on the iPhone and micro-SIM for the other two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is absolutely nothing on the Lumia 1020's left side but the right side more than makes up for it. And we don't mean the usual volume rocker and power/lock key. It's the dedicated camera button that sets this one apart. A proper shutter key is a must here, it's the cameraphone in the bunch after all. Other than having half press to focus, it will launch the camera even if the phone is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of the phones in this comparison has stereo speakers. They each have a combination of microphones for noise-cancelling duties but the fact that the iPhone has not two but three in total doesn't quite explain why it cannot record stereo audio in videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest novelty at the back of the iPhone 5s is the dual LED flash. It features one white and one amber-colored LED, which dynamically combine to create a more natural-looking flash light depending on each individual situation. The rest looks exactly like the previous iPhone 5's aluminum back with two small strips of glass (covering the phone's antennas).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the LG G2 is where all the controls are. There are two volume buttons each side of a power/lock key. You can also unlock the LG G2 by double-tapping on the screen but otherwise the centrally-placed three button combo at the rear is what you use for operating the device, aside from the outstanding screen on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the buttons is the 13 MP camera lens and a single LED flash. The back of the LG G2 features a hyperglaze-like surface with a pattern underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia Lumia 1020 is where a large round plate accommodates the 6-element ZEISS lens of the 41MP camera, the xenon flash and the LED flash, which also serves as a video light. The hump is prominent enough, but something we can definitely live with, considering the huge sensor, the xenon flash and the ZEISS optics we get in return.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, the three devices will appeal to very different kinds of users. The Apple iPhone 5s is impressively compact and lightweight, with sophisticated, premium feel. It will fit in every pocket and is a pleasure to handle. The Nokia Lumia 1020 is one of the best unibodies to have but the handset is massive for the screen size you're getting. The phone itself is notably lighter than the preceding model which neared 200g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wholeheartedly commended LG for the creative choice of location for the hardware keys but other than that the styling is nothing spectacular. Then again, it was the Koreans' best shot perhaps considering they were after a comfortable size and weight. And they didn't want anything to steal the spotlight from the brilliant 5.2" screen anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPhone 5s. To be clear, it's the handling and premium feel that we rate in this one. The iPhone's design may've been used on a few generations already, but it's still relevant, to say the least. Apple's flagship looks, as usual, more like an elegant accessory than a working tool. And it's not just the looks, the iPhone 5s is built to perfection, with great attention to detail. You can easily say the same about the other two as well but theirs is a classic example of looks being second to power and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Nokia Lumia 1020. The polycarbonate unibody has enough of a premium feel and, while the handling might be awkward at first, the solid build and the fact that Nokia integrated such a vastly superior camera tech into a phone's body, help it clinch the second spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2. Certainly not by a mile, though - the LG smartphone is probably the most practical of the three, delivering the highest screen estate to footprint ratio and an ample battery. The lack of any controls on the front to spoil the looks also means that while not as pretty as the other two, the G2 is certainly not a smartphone you'd mind being seen in public with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 5s relies on the familiar 4.0" Retina display that is actually an IPS TFT unit with a resolution of 640 x 1136 pixels and 326 ppi. The LG G2 has the biggest and the highest resolution display with its 5.2" IPS 1080p screen (424ppi). Finally, Nokia's Lumia 1020 is the only one to feature an AMOLED screen with PureMotion HD+ ClearBlack technology. It's a 4.5" unit with 720p resolution and 332ppi pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three displays are protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass, but Apple went even further with an additional oleophobic coating that lowers the fingerprint smudging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s and G2 displays use conventional RGB matrices with absolutely identical pixel arrangement. Of course the LG has the advantage of its pixels being much smaller due to the higher pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 5s and LG G2 matrices under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED display on the Lumia 1020 on the other hand relies on a PenTile matrix with two subpixels per pixel. At this kind of density this makes little difference however - you can notice it if you put it next to the G2, but you'll have to look pretty hard. And when it's the WP8 interface that you are looking at, PenTile makes no difference whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 1020 matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our tests confirmed that the Nokia Lumia 1020 screen is the one with the best contrast due to the naturally deep blacks inherent to AMOLED technology. Nokia has even supplied the Lumia 1020 will a cool color profile app that lets you tune the saturation and color balance to your liking. If oversaturated colors aren't your thing you can tune them down to more realistic levels and if you like that effect you can go all the way up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is the leader in terms of brightness and came second in the contrast test, while the iPhone 5s Retina unit slides right behind it. Differences between the two LCD screens in terms of image quality are pretty negligible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also put those three devices through our sunlight legibility test and the iPhone 5s did a lot better than the other two. Nokia Lumia 1020 and LG G2 both were close to each other, but even though they fell behind the iPhone 5s result, their screens are still usable under direct sunlight and won't give you a hard-time operating the devices outdoors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. LG G2 has the biggest, brightest display with the highest resolution. Quite expectedly the G2 screen is really sharp with the excellent 424ppi ratio and its color reproduction is more accurate than Lumia 1020's AMOLED. All those wins are enough to compensate for its unspectacular performance in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Nokia Lumia 1020. The AMOLED screens are still among the best on the market and the extra punch they provide is preferred by many. It is bigger than the 4-inch Retina and with better contrast. This is, along with the larger size, is enough to easily overshadow the iPhone 5s victory on the sunlight test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Apple iPhone 5s. The 4" Retina is a great screen with excellent image quality, but when you put it next to the much ampler displays of the other two, it just can't compete. It's no longer at top of the food chain when it comes to density either, so it only has the top-notch sunlight legibility going for it in this battle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next up, we come to the all-important battery life - something power users highly regard. The LG G2 has the most demanding chipset and the biggest screen to feed, which should naturally draw more juice. However it also has a 3,000 mAh Li-Po battery to rely on - the capacity is almost as big as the other two combined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 1020 is powered by a 2,000mAh Li-Ion battery, which may not be as big as some would have hoped for, but Windows Phone 8's tight management of background processes might help it stand out here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Apple's latest iPhone 5s has a 1,560mAh Li-Po battery, which is probably the best Apple could fit in the small shell. Still the iOS and the A7 are known for the top-notch battery optimizations, so the smaller capacity might not be too much of a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, our first test is all about 3G talk time. The LG G2 did amazingly lasting a minute over 25 hours before its battery went dead. Next is the Lumia 1020 with an endurance of over 22 hours, and finally, we get a rather modest score (by these standards anyway) out of the iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G2 also bested our dedicated web browsing test. It managed to last more than 11 hours, while the Lumia 1020 battery died half the way. The iPhone 5s slides inbetween, but closer to the top with its 9:58h endurance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback endurance is where the Lumia 1020 AMOLED screen finally demonstrated its strength. The WP8 handset played a looped video for a little bit over 13 hours before its battery reached 10%, while the LG G2 lasted an hour less. The Apple iPhone 5s scored decently, but it wasn't enough to beat the Lumia 1020 or the G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the Apple iPhone 5s suffers from a stand-by drain bug that caused it to die on several occasions when left with a full charge on stand-by overnight. It's probably something that Apple will address shortly with a firmware update, but early adopters should be aware of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. Despite a very respectable performance by the Nokia Lumia 1020, the LG G2 is the clear winner here. It outscored the Lumia 1020 on the call test, beat it on the web browsing test by a mile, and it also remained on par with it when playing videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Nokia Lumia 1020. The Lumia 1020 overall battery endurance rating is just an hour less than the LG G2, however it's a long way behind when it comes to web browsing and calling endurance and only marginally better in video playback, which is what really matters to power users (and those are usually the ones shopping flagships). The Lumia 1020 has to be given credit for offering the most efficient stand-by of the trio, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Apple iPhone 5s. Posting the lowest endurance rating and showing that irritating stand-by drain bug, the Apple smartphone is some way off its competitors here. Its excellent web-browsing endurance that puts the Lumia 1020 will provide some consolation, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All three phones run on up to date versions of their operating systems. Apple iPhone 5s has the latest iOS 7 in charge of operations, Android 4.2.2 ticks inside the LG G2 (4.3 is on the way) and the latest Windows Phone 8 with Amber update runs on the Nokia Lumia 1020. These three competing systems are very different in the way they are operated, but they have a few things in common - rich functionality, intuitive UI and rich selection of third party apps. Let's now see how they stack up against each other.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 5s runs on the newly released iOS 7. It comes with entirely new looks, lots of new features and optimizations, though its underlying operation logic remains the same. All of your apps are on the homescreen, you can tuck them away in folders and there is the familiar dock that can take up to four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 brought the long-awaited Control Center (a swipe from the bottom of the screen) with connectivity toggles, music controls, few app shortcuts and system-wide sharing options. The multi-tasking has been tweaked too - now it is adaptive and you can even choose which apps can run in background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 also offers an updated Notification Center with three tabs, dynamic wallpapers, and automatic app updates. Do Not Disturb mode is also a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What makes the iOS 7 better than the rest of the competitions is:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the iOS 7 definitely has its strengths. It looks fresh, offers functionality that is enough for the majority of users and, not to be underestimated, many of the cool games hit the Apple's App Store first.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G2 runs on Android 4.2.2 though the Optimus UI customizations tun so deep you'll barely see much of the Google OS looks in there. Android OS, unlike the iOS, offers widgets and shortcuts on its homescreen, while all the apps are located in the app drawer. The smartphone relies on virtual buttons that can be customized in terms of count, layout and even skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's lockscreen offers widgets plus and the largest variety of unlock options around (though there isn't anything quite like the TouchID fingerprint unlock on the iPhone 5s). It can be entirely disabled too. LG has come up with this cool way to wake the screen up with a double tap. It's not entirely new as Nokia had it first, but it works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has preloaded the G2 with tons of stuff that will take days to explore everything. There is Guest Mode similar to the Kid's Corner in Windows Phone 8, Q-Slide multi-tasking which launches different apps in small windows anywhere on the screen, there is the Slide Aside app switching too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another notable feature of the G2 is the Quick Memo. It allows you to take screenshots of whatever and take quick notes or drawings on it. Clip Tray on the other hand snaps various content from pretty much everywhere and you can paste it later wherever you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LG G2 also offers Quiet mode, quite similar to iPhone's Do Not Disturb. Here is a quick list of G2's main weapons against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently Android is the most customizable and most capable operating systems and that's why it has come to dominate the market so convincingly. You can even install different launchers (replacing the Optimus UI) without risking your warranty with rooting. The full access to the file system is another excellent argument for the Android fans.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1020 runs on the latest Windows Phone 8 iteration called Amber. The OS also relies on flat looks. It has just two homescreens - a list view of all of your apps and the main homescreen (Modern UI) with live times, where you can pin pretty much everything - apps, links, contacts, songs, videos, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 lets you resize the live tiles. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. Each app displays different content on those tiles, which makes your homescreen look alive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the Kid's Corner. It's a second lockscreen what will lead you to a brand new homescreen where you can pin some content for your kids and make the rest of your OS inaccessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 still lacks a notification center and quickly accessible connectivity toggles, though those are rumored to come with the upcoming Windows Phone 8.1 update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia provides the so-called Glance screen on its high-end Lumia phones, which displays the clock and some notifications on the screen while the phone is asleep (a feature coming straight from the golden Symbian era).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 also proves life-time voice guided navigation that doesn't require a data connection. Depending on your version of Drive or Drive+, you'll either get a license for one country or the whole world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full version of the mobile Microsoft Office Suite comes as standard issue with Windows Phone, letting you view or editing documents, spreadsheets and presentations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Windows Phone is the only one to offer really deep Facebook integration plus Xbox Live support. You can access various content from your Xbox right on your phone, you can even control the console remotely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is where Windows Phone 8 is better than the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 8 OS hasn't been updated for almost a year now and is certainly trailing the competition at this point. Microsoft is hoping to even the odds with its upcoming update, but that might arrive when it's too late for the Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Store is quickly catching up in terms of important apps available there, but there are still some major names missing. The Microsoft OS is also the least user customizable of the three and the one to have the most confusing Settings menu. The way we see it, its major selling points are the innovative UI, complete MS Office suite and the offline navigation, but those are just not enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. The Android OS is highly customizable and with functionality that the other two can't come close to. It has an open file system, file manager, best multi-tasking and huge developer community. Its last standing problem was the sub-par performance, but that stopped being an issue when the 4.1 Jelly Bean release came out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner up: Apple iPhone 5s. The iOS 7 might have lots of restrictions, but it is very easy to use, looks great and gives you access to the world's top-grossing app and content stores. It's got excellent after-market support, too, with each iPhone getting timely updates for at least three years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Nokia Lumia 1020. An awful long time has passed since the last major update of the Windows Phone 8 OS and for a platform this young this is pretty bad news. The app catalog also pales in comparison to the the other two platforms. Software-wise the two major selling points of the smartphone are the complete MS Office suite and the offline navigation, but those are just not enough to give the Lumia 1020 anything but third place here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Talking about performance across three very different platforms is tricky, but we found several cross-platform benchmarks and decided to see what kind of results we'll end up with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's meet our contestants:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple's new A7 chip uses the second generation of Apple-designed CPU cores - these ones are called Cyclone and the two of them run at a relatively low speed of 1.3GHz. Apple's cores offer high performance per clock though and are the first in a smartphone to support ARM v8 (though marketing focused only on the 64-bit support).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG G2 and Nokia Lumia 1020 use Qualcomm-designed CPU cores, but the Lumia is a couple of generations behind. The clockspeed is strongly in favor of the G2 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1020 is behind on GPU tech too, both the iPhone and the LG G2 use the latest generation in their respective family of GPUs - PowerVR 6 series for the iPhone and Adreno 330 for the G2. The Lumia 1020 has a 2xx series Adreno, which was succeeded a couple of times (first by the 320 and now by the 330).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s is at a disadvantage in only one place - RAM. It has 1GB of RAM, while the other two pack 2GB. Still, it's Android that needs it with its open multitasking, while both iOS and Windows Phone 8 are more restrictive to background processes. Since the Lumia 1020 is the only WP8 handset with 2GB RAM, we suspect it has more to do with processing 38MP photos than the OS and apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Nokia Lumia 1020 can't compete in the CPU benchmark round as there's no common benchmark app for all the three platforms. Still, it's not like Snapdragon S4 performance is a mystery, we've sent plenty of those on Android smartphones and we expect performance that's roughly half of what Snapdragon 800 offers (in terms of raw benchmark numbers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 3 was used for the CPU test and we'll be looking at both single and multi-threaded performance. Cyclone seems to have a huge advantage (around 66%) in terms of single-threaded performance over Krait 400, which is highly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This advantage translates very well to multithreaded workloads and the iPhone 5s actually comes out ahead of the LG G2, despite the droid having twice as many cores.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3 (single-threaded)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3 (multi-threaded)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the GPU benchmarks. We're using GFXBench (formerly GLBenchmark), both v2.5 and v2.7. We're using the on-screen tests this time around as raw GPU performance doesn't mean much when game developers will have to make a separate version of the game for each of the three OSes. Also, the LG G2 has almost three times as many pixels to draw on the screen as the iPhone 5s and more than twice as many as the Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of developing games, iOS 7 and iPhone 5s support OpenGL ES 3.0, which will enable more advanced effects. The LG G2 will support it too as soon as it gets updated to Android 4.3. Windows Phone 8 and by extension the Nokia Lumia 1020 doesn't use OpenGL, but Microsoft's own DirectX feature level 9.3 instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as GLBenchmark 2.5 level graphics are concerned, the iPhone 5s and LG G2 will both run games smoothly, hovering around 50fps. Note that benchmarks typically have heavier graphics than actual games. The Lumia 1020 on the other hand barely chugs along at 13fps. This may be due to difficulty of going from OpenGL to DirectX, but if the GFXBench team experienced it, so will game developers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the newer and more advanced graphics of GLBenchmark 2.7, the iPhone 5s stays at a playable level (37fps), the LG G2 drops below the comfort level (22fps) and the Lumia 1020 gives up completely and the scene rendition turns from a video into a stuttering slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we'll look at web browser performance of three very different browsers. True, both Safari and the Android Browser are based on WebKit, but they both use different JavaScript engines and other components.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at HTML5 Test first. While web apps aren't the norm yet, support for the bleeding edge of web technologies is becoming gradually more and more important. Here the LG G2 and the Android Browser (not Chrome) take the cake, with iPhone 5s/Safari on iOS 7 turning in a good performance. Internet Explorer on the Lumia 1020 isn't in step with modern browsers, however, 300 or so is the type of score we were seeing last year.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTML5 Test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for pure JavaScript performance. SunSpider is well understood and JS engines usually optimize specifically for it. Still, the 403ms time of the iPhone 5s is mightily impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kraken 1.1 is a newer JS benchmark by Mozilla (we stayed away from vendor-specific benches like V8 or Octane). Here the iPhone confirms that it's twice as fast as the LG G2. The Nokia Lumia 1020, which was on par with the G2 in SunSpider, drops behind considerably - over 7 times slower than the iPhone. See what we mean about specifically optimizing for SunSpider?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider 1.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran BrowserMark 2, which goes beyond raw JavaScript speed and HTML5 support. Here, the iPhone 5s has a noticeable lead ahead of the LG G2, which in turn is well ahead of the Nokia Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, raw benchmark numbers don't mean a lot but this much is clear - the iPhone 5s performance is superior to that of the rest of the mobile world. Having beaten the best of the non-Apple chipset, Apple could easily keep its gadgets at dual-core processors and the same GPU for the foreseeable future (though the iPads will probably have a few more cores in the GPU).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile, Android 4.2 on Snapdragon 800 is fast enough in all three categories and will probably get faster once the G2 gets its 4.3 update. The CPU will keep all current apps - both native and web - happy, while the GPU will handle heavy games easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the Nokia Lumia 1020 that has something to worry about. The slow (ish) CPU isn't a major cause for concern as the Windows Phone 8 UI and apps work buttery smooth. Web sites will have to disable a few features when running in IE and worst of all, games can't have cutting-edge graphics. Or maybe devs are still learning how to squeeze out the best out of DirectX, either way gaming on WP8 will have bumps in the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s topped most benchmarks and with iOS 7 designed around it, it provides the best experience for general use, gaming and web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner up: LG G2. The LG G2 lost a few synthetic benchmarks, but works smoothly all the same. We did expect four 2.26GHz cores to stack up a little better against the two 1.3GHz custom Apple cores though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3rd place: Nokia Lumia 1020.While the gap between iPhone 5s and LG G2 is almost negligible, the Nokia Lumia 1020 is tangibly behind both in terms of 3d and web performance. Yes, the UI and apps run smoothly, but the old chipset is limiting to developers.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 brings a brand new gallery app on the iPhone. Images are now organized by date and location, for those that have been geotagged. This view is called Moments, with a description always at the top, with time, place and date. Multiple selection, delete and sharing options are available. You can go a step back, to Collections view where you can better view your sorted photos into groups with labels and much smaller thumbs. Those thumbs are still clickable, you can even scroll them to find the one you're looking for (small thumbs are hard to navigate through though). Finally, there is the Year view. It squeezes your collection into tight grids for each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo Stream sharing, which acts like a social sub-network, works really well and is very simple to set up. You choose which pictures to share and who you'd like to share them with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments. Your friends and family can add their own photos to the Shared photo albums. You can even share a Photo Stream publicly to anyone with the link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 uses the same gallery app as the Optimus G and G Pro - in effect, a near stock Android gallery with a few custom touches here and there. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored on the phone. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well. The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winners: Apple iPhone 5s and LG G2. The iOS and G2 galleries share great looks, awesome sharing features, and great organization. Photo Stream is an awesome perk of the iPhone 5s, but it's balanced by the very enjoyable experience that is browsing photos on the 5.2" screen of the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Nokia Lumia 1020. The Windows Phone gallery offers less sorting and viewing options and looks stale.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Video players<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many things have changed in iOS 7 but the video player is definitely not one of them. You can upload only supported formats via iTunes or purchase videos from the iTunes store. This is an extremely disappointing showing by a platform that is supposed to excel at multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G2 has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player supports everything - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound. There are were no issues with higher bitrates and file sizes, either. Subtitles are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some cool features the G2 offers are the pop-up like playback you can switch the player to, and live preview - it's a YouTube-like pop up preview of the video above the scrubber. Speed Control and live zoom are available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of the Lumia 1020 is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing. Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since WP 7.x. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. Quite obviously LG G2 has the most capable, feature-rich and powerful video player among the three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner up: Lumia 1020. Windows Phone 8 offers USB mass storage and supports a lot more codecs than its iPhone rival. Even if you get a more versatile third-party player for iOS, the iTunes-dependency is still an issue, which the less than lightning-fast cloud transfer cannot quite make up for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Apple iPhone 5s. The latest Apple flagship definitely has the worst video capabilities among all three smartphones. Its video player hasn't been improved in ages and should definitely be higher on the priority list for the iOS 8 development.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music players and radio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 music player is exactly the same as the one in iOS 6, its appearance is in line with the new iOS design. You can create playlists, delete songs right from within the player and reorder tabs whichever way you like. There is also an Album view you access it by flipping the device landscape. It lists all the covers to the albums you have in your library. Tapping on an album thumb lists all the tracks in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 offers non-configurable equalizer presets in the Music app settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are logged in with a US Apple ID (the service will roll out in more English-speaking countries in early 2014), your iOS 7 music player will get an additional iTunes Radio tab. It's a music streaming service with the entire iTunes content available for streaming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG G2 also looks much like the one inside the Optimus G and the G Pro. The interface is simple, easy to use, but still offers a lot functionality. The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search. Flipping the device to landscape mode while on the Now playing screen squeezes in a list of other songs by the same artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets and you can even create custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on the LG G2, which can play over a set of headphones or the loudspeaker, but the headphones need to be plugged-in either way (they act as an antenna). You can also scan for radio stations, and save up to six channel presets. There is RDS support just fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1020<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing its own music service called Mix Radio ahead on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's music app also offers equalizer presets from its dedicated settings (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on board the Lumia 1020, thanks to the Lumia Amber firmware. You can use the loudspeaker for the FM radio, though you still need the headset connected as it doubles as an antenna. To enable the loudspeaker playback, just tap and hold on the station and select the appropriate option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. The G2 music player might not be the best looking, but it offers customizable equalizer presets, handy search and sorting options. The G2 also comes with an integrated FM tuner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Nokia Lumia 1020. Nokia Lumia 1020 comes with a free music streaming service, just like the iPhone 5s. It also comes with a skilled music player with equalizer presets. What it has over the iPhone though is a regular FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Apple iPhone 5s. The iPhone offers free music streaming, the music player is quiet the looker with its simplistic design, but it lacks customizable equalizers or other value-added features and the 5s has no FM radio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 speaker managed a Below Average score, which puts it at the bottom of the trio. The iPhone 5s has an improved speaker compared to the previous generation and it now gets an Average mark. The Nokia Lumia 1020 tops them both with a Good score though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither phone managed spectacular results, but the iPhone 5s and the Lumia 1020 will be heard in all but the noisiest environments. It's a good thing the LG G2 has notification lights on both sides of the phone - it really needs them, being too quiet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Nokia Lumia 1020. It's a simple game of numbers here and the Nokia smartphone wins it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner up: Apple iPhone 5s. Three second places in the three tests secure the iPhone 5s the silver medal here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2. Consistently the quietest of the three.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Still photography and video capture have a prominent spot on the list of features of modern smartphones and we'll begin with a look at just that - both the hardware and software aspects of imaging. We'll quickly go over the usability of each interface and what kind of goodies are available right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s has the simplest UI of the three - you get a few toggles and swipe the viewfinder to change the mode. The simplicity comes at a price though, you get very few options (not even a photo resolution option). Still, the phone boasts impressively short shot-to-shot times, AE/AF lock, a capable panorama and Apple's brand new True Tone dual-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has a traditional Android camera UI and most features are hidden in menus with only a few options available in the viewfinder. Still, it has plenty of options to choose from even if some of them are a bit gimmicky. The optical image stabilization (OIS) is great though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 is the phone with the most riding on the camera experience - it has a massive sensor (around four times the surface area of the other two sensors), with OIS, xenon flash and the coveted manual controls that photo enthusiasts will appreciate. It can create cinemagraphs - animated GIFs - out of the box and while it lacks a dedicated HDR mode, the auto EV bracketing will allow you to make an HDR image with a more hands-on approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A big plus is the supersampling tech - along with the full resolution image, the Lumia 1020 saves a 5MP snap. You can also zoom in 3x without losing the 5MP image quality (even after you've taken the photo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a large sensor, relatively fast aperture, xenon flash and OIS, the Nokia Lumia 1020 should do great in low-light. The iPhone 5s has a dual-LED flash and the same f/2.2 aperture, while the LG G2 has a single LED only and f/2.4 aperture, we'll see if the OIS is enough to compensate in low-light still photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Supersampling on the Lumia 1020 can be used to reduce the noise too if you're okay with a 5MP shot, but the shot-to-shot time on the Nokia is around 4 seconds, while the other two are at a sub-second speed. This matters very much for the shooting experience. It is the only phone with a hardware shutter key, which is convenient (and can quickly unlock the phone and launch the camera) but it doesn't make up for having to wait that long to take the next shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having manual controls - including manual focus - on the Nokia Lumia 1020 is pretty cool though. The Apple iPhone 5s has AE/AF lock, which can help out in tricky situations. There's no HDR mode on the Nokia, but the Auto EV bracket option lets you snap up to 5 photos in a -3EV to +3EV range and you can manually make an HDR out of them to your liking (auto HDR doesn't always cut it). Still those 5 photos take around 20 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to panoramas, the iPhone 5s stitches panos with the highest resolution and even adjusts exposure on the fly and seamlessly blends it creating HDR panoramas of sorts. The LG G2 responds with VR panorama, which is similar to Street View images and Photo Spheres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual camera shot allows the LG G2 to shoot with both cameras (so the face of the person taking the photo can be in the frame too), while the Time catch shot will snap a photo before you even hit the shutter key (so you don't miss the perfect moment).There are fun face effects with live preview too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 has some fun camera options too - animated GIFs are a hit on the Internet (since its very beginning) and are much easier to share than other options (say, HTC's Zoe Highlights).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Field of view - how much you can fit into the frame - is another important feature. Instead of hard to visualize numbers, we made this image to show the difference. The Lumia 1020 has a small advantage here, while the iPhone 5s and LG G2 are virtually equal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of video recording, the LG G2 gets into the high framerate video fad with 1080p @ 60fps video, while the iPhone's higher video framerate (720p @ 120fps) is aimed at slo-mo video capture. The Lumia 1020 puts its pro face on and offers a cinema-like 24fps option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1020 also captures high bitrate audio with several high-quality microphones and has a bass filter for concerts and other such loud venues. The iPhone 5s disappoints here with mono audio. The LG G2 has something called Audio Zoom, which LG promises will capture only the sounds of interest in the video and ignore other sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that although the Apple iPhone 5s is the only one of the three without optical image stabilization, its digital stabilization is excellent - in our review of the phone, we pitted it against the HTC One (which has OIS) and the iPhone won. The price of that is cropping the frame, which makes the field of view narrower, here's a comparison:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Nokia Lumia 1020. The manual controls of the Nokia Lumia 1020 are of interest to photo enthusiasts, while the lossless digital zooming will benefit casual users. The audio is great too and Nokia has some of the best hardware OIS. The one major complaint is the slow shot-to-shot time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. The LG G2 has goodies like dual-shot, VR Panorama, Time catch shot, face effects and audio zoom, not to mention the hardware OIS - even if you use only half of them, that's still more than what the iPhone offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Apple iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s has a great camera but it's the embodiment of the point-and-shoot mentality. Apple still ignores things like selectable image resolution, let alone adjustable image properties like white balance or saturation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Still photos: good light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 can produce two image files for each photo - one full resolution shot and one supersampled 5MP image. We'll be looking at both but the 5MP photos are easier to share, while the full resolution shots allow you to zoom and reframe a shot after the fact. They are great to look at as well, though you (or your image viewer) will inevitably have to downscale them unless you have an 8K TV (you don't).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With supersampling, the Lumia 1020 produces 5MP shots that have very little noise and more detail than the 8MP and 13MP photos of the other two. The camera also has very impressive dynamic range, so the lack of dedicated HDR mode isn't felt as strongly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two produce good shots too, but you can see that the resolved detail is lower in some areas (like foliage) due to noise reduction. Still, LG G2 photos have more detail than the iPhone 5s shots and its color rendering is spot on. The iPhone is a bit off, while color saturation in the Lumia 1020 photos is higher than we would have liked (Nokia made a decision to up the saturation compared to the 808 PureView).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full resolution shots look great too - obviously they have more noise and less detail per pixel, but pixel peeping on a 38MP photo is really beyond the point of smartphone photography. We upscaled the iPhone and LG G2 photos to match the resolution of the Nokia to more easily show the difference in captured detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 doesn't do too bad actually, it has a noticeable lead on the iPhone 5s most noticeable in the foliage, but you can also see it in the building in the first crop and the bricks in the third crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s has the lowest resolution camera of the three, but three generations of improvements have made it the best 8MP shooter on a phone. Photos have little noise and plenty of detail, just not as much as some of the best 13MP shooters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 captures 5 megapixels more than the iPhone, but the higher noise levels close the resolution gap a bit. Still, the higher resolution allows the G2 to capture some areas of complex detail better than the 5s camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some crops to demonstrate the dynamic range and the HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Nokia Lumia 1020. The Nokia Lumia 1020 produces amazing 5MP photos and that's that. The full resolution shots look good too, but 5MP is quite enough for virtually all displays. It still pays to shoot full res shots as they allow you to enjoy zooming, cropping and reframing on the phone later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. The LG G2 photos have accurate color rendering and the higher resolution allows it to capture more detail than the iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Apple iPhone 5s.The iPhone 5s features an improved camera over the iPhone 5 and photos do look very pleasing to the eye, but having 40% fewer pixels than the G2 (and no supersampling to rely on), takes its toll.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Still photos: low-light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We took photos in a dark room from about 2.5m (8.2ft) away from our subject. We shot both with the flash forced off and on. Since the Nokia Lumia 1020 produces two photos for every click - 5MP and 38MP - we should note we took the 5MP ones, which have reduced noise thanks to supersampling (those are easy to share too, no point in sharing 16MB photo with heavy noise).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the flash off, the large BSI sensor and f/2.2 aperture of the Lumia 1020 gave it a clear advantage. The shutter speed dropped to 1/3s, though and even the OIS didn't help to prevent a good deal of the photos ending up blurry. Still, despite graininess the non-shaky shots turned out pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s photos were underexposed and noisy and it too struggled with handshake. The G2 performance was more consistent and its photos are better exposed, but don't have more detail in them. This one has Night mode too, but the difference between Normal and Night mode is negligible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we turned on the flash from the same position. Both the Apple iPhone 5s and Nokia Lumia 1020 flashes lit up the scene evenly, though the 1020 xenon flash is visibly stronger. The photos are very consistent and there's plenty of detail with little noise, in short the photos look great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s did fairly well too - despite the higher resolution (8MP vs. 5MP) it has less detail than the Lumia and some photos were a little shaky, but they're quite good by smartphone standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 was a disappointment and we had to reshoot the photos a few times as we couldn't find the ones with flash on - turns out, they just look pretty bad. The noise goes down and there's a touch more resolved detail, but the G2 is the worst performer here, despite shooting at the highest resolution (13MP).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess the distance of 2.5m is outside its flash range. Also, each time the flash triggers the screen goes white and the camera gradually adjusts it which takes about a second - it's as if it doesn't expect the extra light when it turns on the flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Nokia Lumia 1020. The Nokia Lumia 1020 had the best shots with and without flash hands down. The OIS could have helped a bit more, but the 1020 is the clear winner here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner up: Apple iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s does very well for a 7.6mm thick smartphone that doesn't have the benefit of a huge sensor, a bulky xenon flash or optical image stabilization. Photos without flash were a bit underexposed, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2. The LG G2 beats the iPhone 5s when the flash is off, but its single-LED flash proved too weak to be in any help in our test scene.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We saw that the LG G2 has some cool tricks up its sleeve like 1080p @ 60fps, but as we found in the phone's review, that mode drops the quality noticeably below the 1080 @ 30fps quality. So much so that we think the extra smoothness isn't worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 120fps mode for the iPhone 5s turns in some good quality 720p video, but since it's meant for slow-motion rather than high framerate video, we won't include it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'd expect the Lumia 1020 to easily take this round, but the iPhone 5s squeezes in more fine detail (it helps that the field of view is narrower) and has more accurate colors (with a slight tint). The 5s loses points for its mono audio recording though. Another thing we noticed is a shake in the video - videos were shot on a tripod so there's no good reason for the shake, so we went and re-shot the videos only to have the same thing happen. By the looks of it, the fast moving cars confuse the digital video stabilization, which causes the issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors in Lumia 1020 videos are a little too punchy and the phone loses detail to compression and the wide FoV (widest of the three). It beats out the other two with its high-quality audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 goes overboard with the exposure and fine detail isn't on the level of the other two. You'll notice that going to 1080p @ 60fps drops the quality a bit. The overzealous continuous auto focus and white balance don't help its cause either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 does gain a major advantage in low light though, losing very little detail. The iPhone 5s video becomes softer and noisier, but the LG G2 has noticeably more smearing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   iPhone 5s vs. LG G2 vs. Nokia Lumia 1020</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s videos look great and though they lose some field of view (due to the digital stabilization). Our only major complaint here is the audio, there's no excuse for mono sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner up: Nokia Lumia 1020. The Lumia 1020 has more detail in low-light and the best audio of the three by a mile, though the image processing and compression could use some work. It may be the runner up here, but it's a close call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2. The LG G2 video is good, but the focus hunts too much, the exposure is way off and it doesn't have as much detail as the other two. A firmware update or two with some fine tuning to the processing, along with the 60fps mode might help it climb higher, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Are these the top three phones you can get? Well they certainly are in the running, but that's not the point here. It was a panorama instead of the best the three smartphone platforms have to offer. Luckily for the three - Apple iPhone 5s, LG G2 and Nokia Lumia 1020 - they are so different that they are not really in direct competition for the same buyers. We probably don't need this disclaimer, but it was worth pointing it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is arguably the best Android phone at the moment. Some of you, we suspect, want an Android because of its flexibility and options, and iPhone's premium build or fingerprint sensor aren't enough to change your mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 has a beautiful screen and the size that makes web browsing, email, showing your photos and watching videos a wholesome experience. The battery life is amazing too, the phone can take heavy use in stride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has its flaws but a lot of them can be fixed with a software update and the Snapdragon 800 chipset will handle future Android versions and advanced games for some time to come. The glossy plastic is not perfect, and we like the design of the other two better. Also, much like with the phone - the 32GB version is a must, and again, much like with Apple, the modest 16GB upgrade comes with a generously overpriced pricetag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s is a really well-rounded package. It looks great and the new chipset often beats Snapdragon 800, putting Android's core-count superiority in doubt. iOS 7 is not as flexible as Android and not as feature-rich as some custom skins, but its smoothness and ease of use are still very near the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 5s</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that can turn you away from the iPhone 5s is the screen - even entry level phones have gone beyond 4" on other platforms. Yes, it's a great screen in terms of colors and sunlight legibility, but there's no substitute for physical size. A 4.5" makes a huge difference in most productivity and multimedia applications. The geeks in us find it hard to forgive Apple for sticking with the same small screen for two years in a row, while competing phones screens have been growing in leaps and bounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is quite good with the video somewhat surprisingly coming out on top, but 8MP stills don't quite hold up against 13MP Android shooters, let alone Nokia's cameraphone monster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 dominated in still photography and did very well in video recording. Nokia's focus on proprietary camera lens apps also makes sure you'll be getting fun new options with the 1020 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 1020</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We probably could live with the hump but the slow shot to shot time (up to 4sec) is a deal-breaker by our books. And camera aside, you have to make a few other sacrifices if you're going with the Lumia 1020. The relatively large and thick body, coupled with a small battery is the first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Software doesn't help either - Windows Phone 8 still hasn't matured as a platform even after the Amber update. It's not even 3 years old, iOS has been around for nearly twice as long and Apple is adding new features every year and polishing old ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OS also holds back the hardware - you can't have a 1080p screen because of Windows Phone (which means no 5" screens with proper pixel density) and you can't have a powerful chipset. That makes a difference for gaming (a major section of any app store) and even with a custom chip Nokia couldn't get the shot-to-shot time of the camera to acceptable levels. The GDR3 update might fix all that, but it may be too late for the Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s will keep many iPhone users happy for another year, but the relatively small changes won't have many people defecting from Android. The insistence on this kind of screen size may as well cause outbound traffic, though there's no evidence of that for the time being.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 will enjoy the affection of millions of Android users with its large screen and thin bezels, great battery life and the most powerful chipset on a droid. At least until the other companies start unleashing their brand new droids in the coming months. And some of them already have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 will reign supreme in imaging for quite some time to come, but the gap between it and competing flagships will be only growing wider in terms of equipment and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of these three smartphones has their strengths and weaknesses, and while the best always lies ahead, these three are like a snapshot of how far the three competing OS have come and they will surely stay at the top for a while. Shame such an impressive combination of features has to be split three ways. On a second thought, thank goodness the smartphone future is multiplied by three.</paragraph>
