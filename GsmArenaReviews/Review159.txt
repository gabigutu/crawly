			<paragraph>Convergence is the buzzword and the Cyber-shot Walkman affair-turned-marriage is busy producing offspring. And hey, the young Sony Ericsson W995 sure makes the first-born W902 look like a helpless orphan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Easily the best equipped feature phone of the house, Sony Ericsson W995, still more popular as Hikaru, packs in all there is to find at the top of the company portfolio. The full set of connectivity options, the biggest screen on a Sony Ericsson feature phone to date, GPS, Wi-Fi and the great user interface make a sweet enough package on their own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But in the case of W995 they're just the perfect background for the unprecedented blend of music and imaging. The Cyber-shot line is graciously lending its 8 megapixel triumph, while the music dowry includes the latest Walkman 4.0 player, with all the bare Walkman necessities such as Shake control and SensMe. And there's more to make it even sweeter. We called it a marriage and Sony Ericsson have taken due care of the wedding presents. We don't know what else to call the kickstand and the on-board 3.5 mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So Sony Ericsson W995 has it all, doesn't it? Now let's see if it gives it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the phone is expected to hit the market by Q2 2009 (which is just around the corner) and Sony Ericsson didn't mention any price, we can only guess how much it will sell for. It's fair to expect a price tag around the same as the similarly equipped Nokia N86 8MP, which will start shipping at the same time at an estimated 375 euro (before taxes and subsidies).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Nokia N86 8MP offers almost the same features. Almost. The camera is 8.1-megapixel and sports autofocus, but it also comes with Carl Zeiss optics, dual-LED flash (W995 has a single-LED) and the exciting wide-angle lens and variable aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N86's screen is also 2.6" but it's based on AMOLED technology (not TFT) and shines with 16M colors (not just 256K). Both devices have kickstands but the one on the N86 seems more reliable based on what we saw at the MWC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And last but not least, let's not forget that the N86 8MP is a Symbian smartphone with all the possibilities for expansion this entails. It's in the best interests of the W995 that we don't extend this comparison any further!</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N86 8MP</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another competitor of the SE W995 is the smart Samsung i8510 INNOV8, which packs all the Sony Ericsson W995 does, but adds some extra features on top which are well worth checking out. Follow the link to our in-depth review of the INNOV8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8510 INNOV8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that the Sony Ericsson W995 has some pretty strong competition so the decision about which to choose ain't gonna be easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meet us on the next page, where we'll go through its looks, handling and ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W995 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 measures 97 x 49 x 15 mm which, considering the large screen, is quite an achievement. The slider is compact enough to fit in any pocket or purse and weighs 113 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The friendly size and weight are best appreciated in comparison with the other 8 megapixel cameraphone in the Sony Ericsson portfolio. Our new Walkman here is more than 20 g lighter and has lost a few millimeters of the C905 height and girth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 comes in three colors - Progressive Black, Cosmic Silver and Energetic Red. All of them look quite nice, and the red one is particularly eye-catching. Even if the W995 shares the same form factor with the 8 megapixel Sony Ericsson C905, small details like the kickstand at the back and the music controls on the side give the top Walkman quite a distinct look and feel?and a look and feel that leaves a very positive impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brushed metal front and back give it a sophisticated look but we're not particularly fond of the round D-pad and semicircular buttons under the screen. The C905 navigation pad is definitely more stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Did we mention screen size? We guess we did, but the W995 is worth all the fuss for having the biggest display among feature phones in the Sony Ericsson portfolio. The ample 2.6-incher delivers sharp and vivid images at QVGA resolution that are easy to see not only in the dark, but also under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a built-in accelerometer for auto-rotation of the screen. This works really smooth and can be very useful when browsing the internet or viewing multimedia files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the centrally placed earpiece, flanked by an ambient light sensor and the secondary video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys under the screen may fail on looks but are actually quite comfy and even the tiny semicircular knobs are spaced out well enough that they won't be a problem if your fingers are on the large side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is revealed by sliding the Sony Ericsson W995 open. We generally found it comfortable to use although it is somewhat lacking in terms of press feedback. You won't guess by the looks of it, but the alphanumeric keys have such a short stroke they're easily outclassed by even the flatbed keypad of the C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, the keys are well sized with sufficient spacing between each, making it easy to type without looking at the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman key on the Sony Ericsson W995 is on the left side and grants access to the Walkman player and is used for Shake control. Like the keypad, it does suffer a little in terms of press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left-hand side is also the Fast Port connector and the "M2" symbol, which indicates the location of the card slot. Even if it's under the battery cover, it is hot-swappable. The phone ships with an 8GB M2 card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the device is overcrowded. You've got the camera button, which activates the camera and serves as a shutter key as well, the volume rocker and the dedicated music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume keys are too small and uncomfortable but the player controls are just fine. The latter allow quick control of the Walkman player without even having to open the application itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing and holding the Play/Stop button will launch the music player in mini mode and music will resume where you last left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated Walkman player controls glow in the dark when the Walkman player is on. The backlighting has a very pleasant red color, as opposed to the solid white illumination of the keypad and controls. The shutter key also has its own white backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 is equipped with a set of stereo speakers, placed at the top and bottom of the handset. This layout seems the right approach in a phone that's pitched for video and sports that kickstand on the back. But it's not the stereo speakers and not even the kickstand that make the W995 the first among its kind. On the top there is something you won't see on any other Walkman phone - a built-in 3.5 mm audio jack. Hallelujah!!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though we never minded using an easy-to-find 3.5mm adapter with Sony Ericsson phones, the majority of Walkman users believed they deserve that dedicated port on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8.1-megapixel autofocus camera lens is placed at the back. The W995 sports a LED flash for night-time shooting, but there's no camera lens protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What steals the spotlight at the rear though is the controversial kickstand. The idea itself is warmly welcomed, especially considering the great screen. However, the kickstand is far from perfect. It doesn't lock into position firmly enough to bear the weight of the phone and any vibrations on the surface it's placed on could topple the device over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really hope its design will be further polished before the handset gets to the mass market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is made out of metal and has a really nice brushed surface. The cover fits tightly to the back of the body. To remove it, you first need to unfold the kickstand and then gently slide the latch outwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the Sony Ericsson W995 battery cover is removed, you will find the 930 mAh BST-38 Li-Po battery underneath. It is quoted at 9 hours of talk time and 370 hours of stand-by time, which is basically the same as the Sony Ericsson W902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Sony Ericsson W995 is great. The handset is well-made and there are no alarming creaks to question its solid construction. The friendly size and weight are a great asset, and the brushed metal finish is the right kind of styling for a high-end all-rounder. Usability and ergonomic issues were noted but we feel they are altogether minor points against this stylish and solid gadget.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A "flash" of user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 has the highest model number of any Sony Ericsson phone (beating the P990 by a whisker). Well, that says it all - we're dealing with a high-end handset here. The interface is customizable by Flash Lite themes and is sprinkled with smooth animations all over. The interface offers many options and settings accessible at great speed - adding to an uncompromising user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged as usual with signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status indicated at the top. At the bottom of the display just above the context keys are their labels. This leaves plenty of space for the elaborate background animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper is always on the move and really comes alive when the music player is on, making smooth transitions when playback starts or stops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson handsets also come with a handy option for their wallpaper - you can use an application as a background instead of an actual image. Of course you cannot use any application out there - the choice is currently limited to only three apps. These are WalkMate, Sound Sensor and Rock Bobblehead. The step counting WalkMate is probably the only practical app among them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the well-known foursome - one theme-dependent, a 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view. Rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, there to simply indicate what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar, which features tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes work with shortcut keys, it's only the Grid view that allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's another reason to favor the good old grid view over the new gimmicks. The W995 features a couple of new themes we see for the first time. They affect the main menu causing the currently selected icon to break up and then pull back together in one of the best animations we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with other Sony Ericsson phones, you can minimize the progress indicator when receiving a file over Bluetooth but you can't do that when sending a file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is snappy and very polished. Auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive. There's a slightly noticeable lag involved but we guess that's to be preferred over an extra-sensitive accelerometer that can often play up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook keeps tabs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 entries with 20 fields each. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to auto save to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your contacts list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact uses the tabbed interface found throughout the phone. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you are prompted to add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of a contact is filled in a single field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and does quite well at that, so even a "John von Smith" won't fool it. Naturally, you can search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There weren't any call handling or reception issues with the Sony Ericsson W995. Voice quality is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It displays calls in four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 scored an Average mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging united<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Recent Sony Ericsson phones have been quite adept at messaging but in the Sony Ericsson W995 the Messaging menu has been slightly restructured and is all the better for it. The old interface was geared towards SMS/MMS with all the subfolders (Drafts, Outbox, Sent) appearing in the main Messaging menu. The new interface is much more concise and makes email equal to the other types of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Conversations submenu handles threaded SMS - messages between you and a contact are presented in a way that resembles an Instant Messenger application. Messages are sorted by contact into different "conversations".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically all messages but emails go into a shared inbox, while composing new messages regardless of their type (voice messages included) is centralized through the Write new submenu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message the attachment toolbar is available under the text box, granting quick access to adding pictures, videos and sounds. The last two buttons on the toolbar will launch the camera or voice recorder in case you haven't prerecorded what you need for your MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A smooth animation accompanies the switch between the slides of an MMS. This fits in very nicely with the rest of the UI, which doesn't seem content with things just "popping up" on the screen, but instead makes everything just flow seamlessly. Manage Messages is still on board allowing you to move messages to phone or external memory and arrange them by categories, date, size and contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone handles emails as easily as the other types of messages. It automatically downloaded the settings for our Gmail account. The variable font size and full screen view option, along with the bigger 2.6 inch screen, mean a lot more text can fit on screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the phone doesn't recognize the file type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can't handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Media Center likes sharing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Digging deep in the Media Center of the W995 you almost get to think you are using a PMP rather than a phone. It is a portal to all the media the device can handle, both on the phone itself, on the web or via media sharing. It's navigated via a simple and intuitive interface complete with the smooth animations that are all over the phone UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Center allows instant access to the Photos, Music, Videos, Games and Web Feeds on the handset. The current pick is highlighted and the count of stored files is displayed. Since the Sony Ericsson W995 is equipped with a built-in accelerometer, the Media center interface rotates automatically to match the handset orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not all the Sony Ericsson W995 has to offer. It supports DLNA, which means you can share media on the phone (music, pictures, videos, etc.) and play them on a DLNA compatible device over a wireless connection. There are DLNA compatible TV sets but a computer or a last generation gaming console will do just as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson photo gallery is definitely among the best we've seen on a feature phone. It's a convenient tool for managing a vast collection of pictures with great customization capabilities and features. Some of those options include: one-click access to the latest snapshot you've taken, timeline view for your images and tags. Tags are a very helpful feature, offering better ways to make albums - one photo can belong to more than one tag, something you can't do with folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos is a joy with the Sony Ericsson W995, especially when browsing images fullscreen. When you want to go to the next in line, it doesn't simply pop up but instead slides in from left or right. Selecting a photo zooms it in to fill the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One place where the music and imaging skills of the phone come together is the Slide show. You're prompted to pick a mood (no "silent" option this time around) so it can set the proper music background and transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section stores all the images that are not photos taken with the phone's camera. If the currently highlighted picture is animated (.gif) you get a nice preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geo-tagging is of course available, hardly a surprise in such a feature-rich phone. You have the option to view the location where the picture was taken on a map (Google Maps).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Walkman DOES change its stripes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 features the Walkman 4.0 player with all possible extras included and then some. One major addition to version 4.0 is skinning support. The other feature that audiophiles will really appreciate is the 3.5 mm audio jack - a first for the Sony Ericsson Walkman lineup and only second to XPERIA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessed from the sleek Media menu or the dedicated Walkman key, the player supports a vast collection of file formats and has several equalizer presets. In addition, you also get Album art and the proprietary Sony Ericsson Shake control making use of the phone's built-in accelerometer. The accelerometer is also put to use for automatic rotation of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the music player also offers step-by-step filtering of the tracks you want to hear. The D-pad is in charge of music controls and also brings up a list of all the tracks in the current playlist or album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the keys on the side of W995 are a nice set of alternative music controls - they glow so that they're easy to find in the dark and work even with the keypad locked. No worries about accidental presses though: the keys are not raised too much but still easy to press with a finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "Now playing" screen is simple but offers all the needed controls and information. The D-pad offers playback controls with their functions shown at the bottom of the screen. Above them is the current track info such as album art, running time, track name, performer and album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of album art you can opt for visualizations, but since they occupy the same small space as the album art, don't expect a great light show. You'd be better off minimizing the player and enjoying the animations on the home screen during playback. These depend on the currently selected Flash Lite theme so they blend in perfectly with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen also offers info about the currently playing track, album and artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers appear as fullscreen graphics on the Sony Ericsson W995. You can also create a custom equalizer if the presets don't do the trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another highly promoted Walkman feature is Shake control. It allows you to change the currently running track and even shuffle your entire playlist by a simple flick of the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use Shake control is press the Walkman key and shake the phone forward (for going one track forward) or backward (for going a track back). A quick succession of the two moves does the shuffle trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn the volume up and down by gently tilting the handset while you hold the Walkman key pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other music-related Walkman goodie, SensMe, is a different approach to populating a playlist. Instead of choosing genre or performer, you are presented with a coordinate system. The vertical axis is the tempo - fast to slow, and the horizontal axis is the mood - sad to happy. Songs are shown as dots placed accordingly and you use a circle to select the one fitting your mood best. You can of course modify the radius of the circle and repeat this several times for any playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As cool as that sounds it does have one inconvenience - the songs must be tagged by the Sony Ericsson Media Manager software. To do this you use the manager to transfer the songs with the SensMe analysis option enabled. Tagging songs by hand is not possible so you need to choose between analyzing the songs with the Media Manager, which takes a while, or do without SensMe until you have more time to transfer the songs properly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W995 is certainly one of the best efforts from the company in terms of audio quality. It easily ranks among the best examples currently on the market getting an impressive number on every reading in our test. We've been quite worried over the past few devices by Sony Ericsson that went through our sound lab but the W995 clearly shows that they are simply exceptions from the company's otherwise excellent record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone flaunts an amazing frequency response keeping within the +-1db range effortlessly with only the lowest of frequencies slightly cut off. Furthermore, for most of its range it is right on the perfect track. Noise level and dynamic range readings are praiseworthy and so are the distortion levels. The crosstalk is also excellent, adding up to one of the industry best quality audio outputs to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W995 vs Apple iPod Touch 2G frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on the Sony Ericsson W995 supports RDS and TrackID. You can store up to 20 stations and use the auto save feature to scan and save stations automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio can be minimized to play in the background and controlled via the Walkman keys but, unlike the music player, it doesn't have any visualization on the home screen, not even the RDS info. The previous/next buttons can be used for tuning in - one short click for going 0.1 MHz up or down, and a longer press for switching between saved stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Due to the high user interest, we want to make it clear that our test Sony Ericsson W995 didn't have a built-in FM transmitter and despite all the rumors we have no reason to believe that the final retail unit will have that as well. Sony Ericsson have never announced that the W995 will have the feature and further discussions on the matter seem redundant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Sony Ericsson W995 supports fast-forward, rewind, and slow-mo playback. It can play in landscape and has three options for video size - original, auto fit and full screen (which crops the video if needed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of the video player is the screenshot capability. It allows you to save a frame of video and add it to the gallery. To help you get exactly the frame you want, there's the option to skip frames one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is nice but the kickstand on the back and the bigger screen seem to promise great video viewing. However, in this respect the W995 fails to deliver, since there's no support for DivX and even better XviD, or any other advanced video codec. A shame really, given the provided 8GB memory card can store hours of high quality video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since W995 is not a smartphone, there's no way to install a third party program to get around this disadvantage. DLNA support could have made it a pocketable movie player but apparently, video capabilities took second place to music and imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can always convert your video files to the supported MPEG4 format, but that will probably bring down the bitrate and audio quality. Additionally, the regular 3:4 aspect screen will hardly fit widesceeen videos nicely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman is catching up with Cyber-shot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel power of the W995 is harnessed in the friendly and efficient camera interface which we've known - and appreciated - across a number of high-end Cyber-shot handsets such as the C905. While the handling and features are quite familiar, the camera quality is not what we expected - no, a Walkman is not a Cyber-shot. The picture quality of the W995 snapper is just adequate, while on the C905 it's exceptional. Bear in mind though that this is a pre-release unit and the final quality may differ from our test shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 MP AF camera on the W995 offers a wide range of features like face detection, camera images geotagging, exposure metering, image and video stabilizer, BestPic, auto-rotation, macro mode, etc. The W995 camera interface lacks any option for setting the ISO levels, something that was also missing on the Cyber-shot flagship, the C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W995 is capable of a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels with an average file size of about 2 MB. The lens is not protected, but there is a PowerLED flash to assist in short-range shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls are very comfortable to use, especially the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises in the latest Cyber-shot interface. Settings on a toolbar with pop-up submenus and the Multi Menu have become well known since the K850 and do help the overall user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two photo keys over the display and the D-pad in camera mode give access to the most frequently used camera settings like focus mode, exposure, flash control, and self-timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, the viewfinder toolbar lets you control shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus mode, flash, self-timer, exposure metering, white balance, effects, and additional settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most modern cameraphones, the Sony Ericsson W995 has face detection built right in. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces, unlike normal focus, which is usually locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no smile detection or a.k.a. Smile Shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra quick-snapping BestPic mode has two varieties - fast and slow. In fast mode it produces 7 full-size 8 megapixel images at intervals of about 0.8 sec, while in slow mode it takes 7 images again but at a longer interval of about 1.7 sec. Sadly, the flash is unusable in either of the two modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a built-in GPS receiver, the Sony Ericsson W995 is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images. You can enable geotagging (Add position) from the settings to add GPS location data to your pictures. A flag icon at the bottom of the viewfinder indicates that the option is activated. A satellite icon in the top left corner shows that the phone is attempting to get a GPS lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proper geo-tagging of images requires some time for the GPS to lock position. The successful lock is depicted by a set of green stripes in the upper right corner of the camera viewfinder (right next to the satellite icon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, speed up the process by enabling the Assisted-GPS function, but this generates extra data traffic on your account so bear that in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View on map option displays the place where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 has a Power LED flash, which is also used as a focus assist beam. The flash is pretty bright and surprisingly effective in dark conditions. Of course, nothing can really compare to a xenon flash, but it still does a nice job and can be used for video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in the W995 allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm. The optional silent shutter is also a feature worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one shortcoming we found with the W995 concerns the one-way menu layout - to get to the Extra settings you have to go through all the other settings on the toolbar as it's the last item there. Looped browsing of items on the toolbar should have been possible, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands. This problem persists in W902, C905 and other previous Sony Ericsson phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what's up with the picture quality? Unlike the 8 megapixel Cyber-shot C905 - whose photos astonished us - the W995 suffers a similar problem to all other Walkman phones: the pictures are noisy and oversharpened, and the lively colors and contrast are gone. Another old friend makes an appearance here too - the purple fringing on the edge of buildings. Even the picture detail is less than on the C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, hey, don't get too gloomy over this - the overall impression is good. The W995 camera catches the moment just as any Cyber-shot does. It has almost all of its features and the photo quality is reasonably satisfying. There is certainly work to be done on the image processing algorithm and we really hope this will happen before the phone is out on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a picture is worth thousand words, so here come several camera samples produced by the Sony Ericsson W995.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the W995 is also capable of capturing video, which according to a Sony Ericsson rep over at the MWC 2009 should go to WQVGA resolution at 30fps - not really impressive but still a progress. Unfortunately, our pre-release unit, was only able to record video in QVGA resolution at 30fps. The clips are recorded in MPEG4 format and take about 6 MB for every minute of recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-inclusive connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options of W995 are full on. Quad-band GSM/HSCSD/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board, so there is virtually no spot on earth where you will be unable to connect. In addition, you've got the fastest data transfer around provided that a HSDPA-enabled network is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, Sony Ericsson W995 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile which allows you to listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. The other major connectivity feature is the built-in Wi-Fi with DLNA support, and GPS with A-GPS support rounds out the list. Last, but not least, there is also the M2 card slot, which is often one of the quickest ways of transferring data to and from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from its imaging prowess, the W995 is notable for having Wi-Fi among its connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's integrated rather well in the user interface and is quite user-friendly. Once you turn Wi-Fi on, you get a list of the available wireless hot spots and connecting is a matter of single click. It is also available via "My shortcuts" in case you don't want to go hunting for it in the menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser and all other data traffic is re-routed through the Wi-Fi connection by default. If your Wi-Fi connection is lost, the browser automatically starts to use GPRS or higher speed network connections when available. And you don't have to guess whether Wi-Fi is enabled or not as there is an icon on the top status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto connect, Wi-Fi networks priority, and assigning a favorite network are among some of the very practical features in the Wi-Fi interface. Additional settings allow you to search networks by their SSID, check your connection status or MAC address (you cannot change that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MediaGo multimedia manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 is the first phone to ship with the recently announced MediaGo media sync manager. It's a computer-based software that you use for transferring your music, videos, games, podcasts or playlists to your Sony Ericsson phone. MediaGo allows for automatic syncing of your multimedia collection, as well as easy Music CD ripping and PlayNow store integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of its key features is that it can transcode all multimedia on-the-go so that it can run on the mobile phone trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In way MediaGo is just like iTunes for Apple products - you can manage your multimedia library with it, you can transfer content to your phone and even convert it to a suitable format seamlessly and finally, and finally, it has an integrated store for purchasing music, videos, games and ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MediaGo will launch with the Sony Ericsson W995 release and will be available in 15 languages. We're testing the W995 before its official launch, so we couldn't try the MediaGo as it is still not ready.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson also announced that they are planning to hit video playback from all sides by not only focusing W995 on video, but also by providing an unlimited movie download service via PlayNow Arena - at a certain monthly subscription, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we got a beta version of Media Go shortly after W995, we managed to pull off a dedicated article on what the application CAN and CANNOT do for you and your Sony Ericsson handset. Feel free to check it out too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing is sweet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 has an Access NetFront browser v3.4 featuring the extended custom home screen, also available in many previous Sony Ericsson handsets (like W902, W595, C905, G705 and T700, which we recently reviewed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. The dedicated full screen mode is replaced by the auto-rotate feature, which actually opens it in full-screen landscape mode and looks great on the big screen. View modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom, and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is a real pleasure to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page and the first match is immediately listed as soon as you type a letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If are still not satisfied with this browser, you can always count on the superb Opera Mini as a suitable replacement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Alarms, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Light, Calculator, and Code memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly and weekly views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts you to add it to the calendar. Tasks can be of two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarms are part of the main menu and there are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm every day or on chosen days of the week. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the familiar basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include MusicDJ and VideoDJ. VideoDJ is for making your own video clips by mixing already existing ones with still pictures, text and a variety of effects or for making basic cuts using special transitions and adding background music. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED light on the back of the phone can also be used as a torch thanks to the Light application. The LED can be on continually or for a period of one minute only and it can also blink out an SOS signal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lots of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, the Sony Ericsson W995 comes with several preinstalled: CamPlus, Comeks Strips, Music Mate 5, Music Quiz, Rock Bobblehead, Sound Sensor, VoiceFX, Walk Mate and a YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comeks Strips is an application that lets you add speech bubbles and various comic-style additions to your camera photos. The comics you make can be then saved or sent via MMS. Making comics is fun and easy following the step-by-step wizard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most interesting applications that come preinstalled on the Sony Ericsson W595 is Music Mate 5. It consists of several music-centered mini applications, the first of which allows you to play music by shaking your phone. You can choose from a huge list of musical instruments for each direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music Mate 5 also includes a Beatbox with quite a variety of beats. The application can also help you play the guitar or keyboard by demonstrating the proper finger positions for individual chords. Finally, Music Mate 5 includes a guitar tuner that can help you tune your guitar using the phone's microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Quiz is exactly what its name says - you have to name the title, artist, album or year of release of random tracks in your music library. Long story short: a part of a song is played each round and you have 5 to 30 seconds to guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rock Bobblehead is a totally useless application allowing you to play bobblehead with an Elvis Presley doll using the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound Sensor catches the surrounding noise and shows it in a real-time graphical diagram - just like an equalizer or music-animated visualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The VoiceFX application records your voice and then allows you to apply different filters and effects to it before saving the new sound file to your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walk Mate is a simple step counter application that works in background mode based on the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And at the end we find the YouTube client, which gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarking favorites and so on. It's really nice and it's also tightly integrated into the Media center, so it's always on hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the beta of the Java application is available for download over at the YouTube website.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Available to download for free and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, Google Maps for Mobile comes preinstalled on the W995. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all the features of Location services, internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are calculated with overall guidance based on the available information in the database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view and the user interface is clean and intuitive. Traffic information is another important feature here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60-minute period. GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is extremely easy. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Log application in the Location services tracks and saves each position request, which is accessible at any time afterwards. Each entry in the log is saved in descending order by date and displays the date and time, as well as the exact GPS position.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vodafone Find&amp;Go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As our Sony Ericsson W995 is a Vodafone-branded one, GPS navigation is handled by Vodafone Find and Go, a software application that provides you with all the essentials: 3D maps, turn-by-turn voice prompts and traffic updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes preinstalled on the phone, but it's available only for Vodafone UK users. There is no need for any monthly payment since everything is free apart from the GPRS data you use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of Vodafone Find and Go, the regular non-Vodafone version of the Sony Ericsson W995 should be equipped with a trial version of the well known Wayfinder Navigator, which we have written about in numerous Sony Ericsson reviews.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>So many games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 packs seven preinstalled games, some of them using the motion sensor: Bowling, Bubble Town, Diamond Island, Guitar Rock Tour, NitroStreet Racing, Playman Extreme Running and Real Football 2008.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bowling is a small but fantastic game using the motion sensor. Choose your position, direction and then swing with your hand and watch what happens. It's great fun and you can play in tournaments with your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next game is Bubble Town. It's a simple bubble breaking game that involves shooting colored balls and forming three or more identical bubble combinations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Diamond Islands is the other motion game. You are in charge of a bunch of prehistoric men pushing a giant rectangular block. Your objective is to control them using the motion sensor and collect diamonds on the way to the final destination. In the beginning things are very easy, but in the levels that follow things can get pretty tricky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are fan of the console series Guitar Hero and its siblings, then this one is perfect for you. It has the same logic - you need to press the right buttons at the right time to hit the correct notes and play the song as it should be played.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nitro Street Racing, as you might guess, is a Need for Speed clone. The objective is simple - you must finish first in the race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today running is all the rage and this latest extreme sport already has a 3D game available on computers and consoles - Mirror's Edge. Extreme Running is a copycat of the free 2D version of Mirror's Edge and it's a kind of jump'n'run with some easy quests thrown in. You have to perform various acrobatic moves and spectacular jumps and spins to progress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What can we say about the last one - it's a standard football game with intuitive controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W995 is the company's top-ranking Walkman and its spec sheet is clearly set to justify this label. The Flash-based user interface, which we've praised repeatedly, seems to be only getting better. There are no gaps in the connectivity set and the 3.5 mm audio jack is a long-awaited blessing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W995 not only spares users the agonizing choice between Walkman and Cyber-shot. It has simply harvested all the high-end goodies and leaves nothing else to want. And all that skill is packed in a compact, solid and stylish body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not hard to believe it was all too easy for Sony Ericsson to get carried away. Amid the first ever and best ever hype they somehow overlooked video. Just like Sony Ericsson by the way, and it wouldn't have been a big deal if they didn't make a big deal of it themselves. Why bother put a kickstand when the commitment to great video was never taken seriously? No kickstand can make up for the lack of codec support, inadequate screen resolution and no widescreen aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And still, the poor video is the only major grudge with W995. We just hope it doesn't need to be reminded that the devil's in the details. In all fairness, video should not be make or break for the majority of users, especially when all the rest is up to scratch. It's just that Sony Ericsson W995 will be held to a higher standard. It can't help it, just like it can't help the heavy smartphone fire on the high end of premium all-in-ones.</paragraph>
