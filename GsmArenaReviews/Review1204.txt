		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's one to keep you busy while you wait for the Galaxy S III. One that may help the original Galaxy S finally take the hint and hang up its boots. The Galaxy S Advance is the next in a string of sequels looking to get the best afterburn out of Samsung's top-selling Android flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance could be spotted at this year's MWC along with other space-fillers like the Wave 3 and the Omnia W. Nothing wrong with either of those but the actual stars of the show were a couple of tablets and a new projector phone. Samsung had a rather underwhelming showing and used the venue to promote the hell out of their Galaxy Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phoneblets and tablets must be higher on Samsung's agenda these days. Or they may've been asked to kindly abstain from major launches to give the Galaxy Nexus a good free run. Whatever the reason, the Galaxy S Advance comes at a dry time for the company in terms of major phone headlines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, life is a series of peaks and troughs and the S Advance finds itself at the low end of the oscillation. But it's by no means in need of being comforted and reassured. This is a rather solid package we're looking at, considering it'll be competing in the midrange. The combination of dual-core and Super AMOLED puts it in the elite company of the Note, the Nexus and the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course there's fine print in just about every deal. The AMOLED screen of the Galaxy S Advance is the PenTile variety and the WVGA resolution isn't the best there is. The NovaThor U8500 chipset is still to prove its worth and there's no commitment to ICS upgradability as yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are known for trying to rule any price segment by sheer numbers and the Galaxy S Advance gives them extra penetration in the upper midrange. What we're not sure about is whether they need all that depth. Having already seen the Galaxy R at work, it seems the S Advance doesn't offer that much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They're perhaps meant for different markets. The S Advance for example is expected to debut in Russia before seeing wider availability. Anyway, the S Advance and the Galaxy R look very similar on paper save for the screens and the chipsets. But we won't rush to judgments before we've run our usual benchmarks. No need to tell you they're coming up, but first we'll see about the design and build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance does well to keep depth below a centimeter. The 9.7 mm slim handset weighs 120g, which is more than acceptable for a four-incher. Ergonomically curved, the Galaxy S Advanced is comfortable to hold and no hassle to carry around or slip inside a pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The philosophy behind the Galaxy S Advance is simple. They didn't obviously want to waste money and time on a brand new styling. And although the mix of older and more recent designs could've backfired, the Galaxy S Advance works rather fine. Asymmetrically curved like the Galaxy Nexus, the phone looks good and is very nice to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved back - resulting in subtly curved-in screen a la Galaxy Nexus - isn't just a self-serving design accent. The phone really feels heavier at the bottom than the top - making it very comfortable and secure to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looked up front, there's little to set it apart from the original Galaxy S. The Advance is just a tad more angular, which looks good. More like the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display is the usual set of Android controls - capacitive Menu and Back keys and a physical Home button. The haptic-enabled touch buttons stay out of sight until you tap the screen. The Home key is wide and narrow, a little less comfortable to press than on the original Galaxy S. Above the display you'll find a 1.3MP secondary camera, proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Advance is obviously smaller than the Galaxy S II and the Galaxy Nexus, though not as much as the difference in screen size may suggest. What's more important from a user's perspective is that four inches of Super AMOLED real estate come in a reasonably compact package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the screen of the Galaxy S Advance to be a tad darker compared to other AMOLED units. It offers the same great contrast and deep blacks but is a bit low on brightness. Still it's a joy to work with outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone holds the power/lock button. Samsung regulars should be used to that arrangement and the button has nice press feedback. The Galaxy S Advance has no shutter key, obviously taking after the original Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume keys are placed on the left side of the phone - sharing a single piece of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of the peculiar curve resulting in slimmer top, both ports are at the bottom. The microUSB port, used for both charging and data transfers, is right where it belongs, but the audio jack should've made more sense on top. The top of the Galaxy S Advance is completely bare for reasons already mentioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the finely textured back. The delicate pattern has no grip-enhancing qualities, but looks like a nice, subtle way to get around glossy plastics. The downside it seems vulnerable to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here at the back is where the 5 MP camera lens traditionally is, along with a loudspeaker grille and single LED flash that appears to be unexpectedly powerful. It lit up our studio way better than the iPhone 4S for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoing the plastic back panel reveals the phone's innards. The SIM card compartment and a hot-swappable microSD card slot are next to each other and there's a 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery inside. We didn't have time for a proper battery test but we hope we'd be able to get this sorted later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With phones closing in on smaller tablets in terms of screen size, the Galaxy S Advance is doing things the old-fashioned way but there's nothing wrong with a 4" diagonal in a comfortably compact package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a solid phone, and good looking. Despite being mindful of budget, it feels very well put together, no alarming noises when handled. We don't mind the plastic build, the durability of the battery cover being one minor concern. With nothing groundbreaking on offer here, the phone does well to, at least visually, set itself apart from the numerous Galaxy S sequels. Now, it's up to the software bundle and the performance to build on a positive first impression.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android topped with TouchWiz 4.0 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance runs Gingerbread 2.3.6 with the most recent TouchWiz 4.0 launcher. From a software standpoint, you're looking at an interface almost identical to that of the Galaxy R.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at our video of the device in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the same as ever-swiping in any direction will give you access to the phone. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is still here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates tons of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreens. A pinch zoom brings you to an aggregate view of all homescreen panes, which can be edited: rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets, shortcuts or folders are pulled onto the homescreen from a drawer that appears at the bottom of the screen once you enter edit mode (press and hold on an empty spot or do Menu &gt; Add).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is very similar to the homescreen - you can create folders to go with your shortcuts and you can add, remove and rearrange pages just like you would homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer, you can choose List view instead of the default Grid view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical TouchWiz fashion, there are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible both on the homescreen and in the app launcher. You can swap the first three with different ones (by default the shortcuts are Phone, Contacts, Messaging). The rightmost is the app drawer/home shortcut used to toggle between the apps menu and the homescreen, so it makes sense to always keep it in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung Galaxy S Advance you get a standard Android task switcher but with one modification - it has a button to launch a task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom task manager which Samsung have preinstalled offers a lot of functionality. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the time, Android does really well when it comes to managing apps by itself (in fact, some claim that using a task manager is detrimental to the performance of a phone), so you would only need the task manager to occasionally kill a buggy app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance uses an ST-Ericsson NovaThor processor with two 1 GHz Cortex-A9 cores, Exynos's Mali-400MP GPU and 768 MB RAM. It's enough to rival the best in dual-core smarts out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've lined up the dual-core 1GHz Tegra 2-running Galaxy R and dual-core 1.2 GHz Exynos-running Galaxy S II for the Galaxy S Advance to fight against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first benchmark is BrowserMark tests HTML5 and JavaScript performance and the Samsung Galaxy S Advance came on top here, beating the Galaxy S II by quite a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BrowserMark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider tests JavaScript performance - here the Galaxy S Advance comes on top once again, while the Galaxy R fails miserably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> SunSpider </paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi is all about processor calculation speeds. The newer processor architecture in the Exynos proves itself here tramping both the Tegra 2 and NovaThor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BenchmarkPi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack focuses on CPU performance - here the Galaxy S II beats the Advance, which came in second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Linpack</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance has a skilled SoC and performs admirably even against superior smartphones. In casual daily use you will not find that big of a difference between it and the Galaxy S II. There's no lag and no hiccups and the Galaxy S Advance is a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Superior social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right to add another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your Facebook or LinkedIn account. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge your contacts (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information while the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weirdly, only Facebook and LinkedIn contacts can be synced with the phonebook - we usually see Twitter contacts in here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance had almost no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and fairly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each in a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches names and numbers simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only one contact (with photo) is shown at a time in the Smart Dial suggestions. You can tap the down arrow to view the rest (a digit above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting or holding the call, or adding another call to your conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, while sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also performed our traditional loudspeaker test. The Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance scored an Average mark. The vibration on the other hand is strong, which will alert you in case you don't hear the ringer in a loud environment. Here's how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A boatload of messaging features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts so it's easy to tell which email was pulled from which account. Conversation view is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. Video chat support is also onboard here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as XT9. Both are fairly comfortable, although if you're coming from a bigger screen, the keys might feel a little cramped. The landscape keyboard should be good enough though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slick gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. It supports sharing images over Bluetooth, email, messaging along with uploading to Picasa or using DLNA to push the image to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also offers some editing options - cropping, 90-degree rotation and some more advanced features such as image adjustments, effects and selections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My Files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The well-established music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove categories to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can skip songs or FF/rewind by sideways swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple yet powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size, and it also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There's 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also change font size and adjust subtitle sync (move them back or forth in time) but there's no option to manually load subtitles; they have to have the same filename as the video file to load properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player handled most videos we threw at it with ease. DivX and XviD videos at 720p resolution weren't a problem, but 720p h.264 lagged. The player had no trouble with sound codecs (most other phones choke on AC3 or DTS sound).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance did pretty well in our audio quality test. The audio output from the phone was averagely loud and pretty clean, which is about what you'd expect from a mid-range droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When used with an active external amplifier the Galaxy S Advance is really great. As you can see from the table below every aspect of its performance is flawless. The only thing you might not particularly like is the subpar loudness, but that's hardly a huge issue here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, mostly in terms of intermodulation distortion. Both of those rises to just below average levels, while the other readings remains virtually unaffected. A solid performance overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance comes with a 5MP camera and an LED flash. It captures photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get the front/back camera switch and the flash control. You can replace those two and add two more (for a total of four) shortcuts to any option in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Galaxy S Advance really impresses with some great image sharpness while keeping colors at an acceptable level of saturation. In some scenes we even noticed lower noise levels while keeping the same level of resolved detail, which is commendable. The Galaxy S Advance photos also have good contrast and accurate white balance. Here are some camera samples shot by the Galaxy S Advance:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also saw commendable performance at macro level.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance enters our Photo Compare Tool alongside other 5MP shooters. The tool's page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first chart, there are slight traces of a pink spot that the processing software attempted to remove. The Galaxy S Advance shows far superior image sharpness when compared to the more expensive Galaxy S Plus-when comparing the grass patch in the second chart the difference is almost night and day. Finally, the third chart shows the aforementioned acceptable saturation levels, as well as a white balance that doesn't stray towards any particular hue, as seen in the black and white photograph.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>720p video recording is sans focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera. You get the same customizable panel on the left with four shortcuts. You can use the front camera to record video too, but at a lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera shoots 720p video at 30fps in .MP4 format, with at a bitrate of 10.1Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos themselves, like the camera, have some great color saturation and white balance, but unlike the still camera, they leave something to be desired in the sharpness department. We also see a small amount of aliasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly, the video camera does not attempt to focus the image automatically, nor does it feature the ability to focus the image manually. The sound quality is a bit low; mono @ 96Kbps bitrate and only a 16.0kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample we uploaded to YouTube for your viewing pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, here's an untouched 720p@30fps sample (13.8MB) straight from the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video quality compare shows how much the lack of autofocus hurts the Galaxy S Advance. While the colors are richer than the Galaxy S Plus and the Galaxy W, we see a noticeable lack in sharpness. This is particularly apparent when comparing the lights of the Ferris under low-light conditions. The ISO chart also shows how the Galaxy S Advance underperforms the less expensive Galaxy W in this regard.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Streamlined and feature-rich connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance has quad-band 3G and GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, with HSPA+ (21 Mbps downlink and 5.76 Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Bluetooth 3.0 for fast local file transfers. Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n support and a Wi-Fi hotspot option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from various devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-rated web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed. Its user experience is, as always, flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another neat trick is the browser-specific brightness setting. You can, for example, boost the brightness in the browser to comfortably view your web pages but keep the general brightness low to conserve battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Flash 11 support, which means you can watch YouTube videos right in the browser (videos up to 720p worked smoothly) and play Flash games too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Hubs - games, Facebook and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we've seen before - it combines your email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and email accounts and shows all incoming messages on one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There's filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Hub lets you browse music online (with search tools, charts, lists of new releases and so on). You can preview songs (30 seconds each) and buy tracks or whole albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Game Hub, which will quickly become your go-to place for finding new games. The titles break down into Social and Premium, and there's a news section, too. You also get to try before you buy. The nice thing about that Hub is it includes the titles by Gameloft, which are otherwise not available on the Android Market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive office suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance comes with Polaris Office preinstalled. It's one of the most feature-rich mobile editors we've seen. You can view, edit and create Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents (Office 2003 and Office 2007 are supported) and there's a PDF viewer as well. The app enables searching through your office files just like in a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a large number of editing options - from font size and style, justification and bulleting options, to table styles. You can easily pick Excel functions from a list too (a feature commonly missing in mobile editors).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A plethora of organizational tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view (often referred to as Agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Turning the phone landscape reveals more advanced calculator functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance features a decent alarm clock application with a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a To-Do app called Task and a Voice recorder to round off the organizer functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The latest Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance managed to get a GPS lock in just under a minute without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The improved Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance has the latest version of the Android Market. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer's web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone - from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who's connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus, Galaxy SL and the Galaxy R must be anxiously looking at each other wondering which one will need to move aside to make room for the newcomer. We don't think any of them needs to worry too much. It's the original Galaxy S that should be ready to pack up and call it a day. Good going.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>With the Galaxy Nexus and the Note doing their best to keep Samsung in the spotlight, the Koreans are filling in some blanks in the upper midrange and keeping the troops sharp and focused for the arrival of the new flagship. The Galaxy S III will wait a bit more, perhaps letting the Galaxy S II enjoy a full year at the helm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Advance will probably be little affected by the turmoil at the top. This is a phone that brings nothing new to the table, but it may actually have found itself a niche. Crowded as the Android playground may seem, there's almost no competition matching the exact Galaxy S Advance skillset. The supply of any 4" AMOLED dual-core smartphone alternatives is almost non-existent. Now, we can only hope Samsung did their research and found out there's actually demand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The competition is a rather loose assortment of powerful smartphones, some long past their prime. The LG Optimus 2X was the first dual-core droid we tested a year ago. It's an absolute steal now, and it's still an impressive all-round performer.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix 2 has been offering the same level of equipment as the Galaxy S Advance for a few months now - save for the AMOLED display. It goes on to top it though with a 4.3" qHD screen and an 8MP camera with full-HD video. And that costs a lot less than the Galaxy S Advance.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Advance costs almost as much as the Galaxy S II, and that pretty much sums it all up. This is not the best position to be in. Right now Samsung can say they're releasing a brand new midrange phone instead of waiting for yesterday's high-end to slide down the ranks. But with the competition offering better equipped phones for less, they don't make much of a point.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Galaxy S Advance must've cost Samsung nothing to build. It's a mix and match of designs and features. In fact, it's the same package as the latest projector-phone by Samsung. And we mean exactly the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam is the kind of phone to show to the press at venues like the MWC. The Samsung Galaxy S Advance is for customers who wouldn't care to check what the competition has to offer. Good looking and reasonably powered, the Samsung Galaxy S Advance is for people who don't actually care about how many cores and which version of Android there is inside.</paragraph>
