		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak has crossed the line where phones stop ? and by some distance too ? but we are still not completely convinced it?s beyond the point where tablets start. Is the Dell Streak sitting on a fence or sitting right in the middle of nowhere?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve reviewed all sorts of devices over the years but never did we have more trouble telling exactly what it is that we?re reviewing. And the device itself doesn?t help us make our mind up either. Sure it has a SIM card but those landscape-oriented buttons reveal its tablet intentions. It all boils down to what you want it to do, not what you think of it, we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This smartphone / tablet may have identity issues but its timing is right. With smartphones getting better and bigger ? and tablets riding the Android tide ? the moment is ripe for the Streak. And the best chance Dell have of making a difference in the smartphone game is to take opportunities like this and make them count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We for one would love to see how that experiment pans out. It?s all to play for in a segment so vastly undeveloped (and that?s an understatement really). So will the Streak prove that a 5? screen is the right balance between portable and usable or will it fail to convince? We?ll have to wait until the end of our review. Looks like we start on the right foot anyway ? with design and hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well packaged<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak is a high-end device and so is the packaging. There?s a nice 3-piece charger inside that uses the USB cable to connect to the phone and one of the two supplied plugs to go into the socket. By providing both, Dell spares you the need to buy a travel adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The supplied microSD card is the impressive 16GB but the really nice touch is the enclosed carrying pouch to keep your Streak protected when you carry it around. Finally, you are getting a one-piece headset (so replacing the headphones but keeping the mic isn?t an option) and some paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no CD supplied as the Dell Studio installation files are available on the microSD card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dell Streak 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This one here may be too big for a phone ? or too small for a tablet. Some might even find the size just fine ? it wouldn?t be that incredible you know. In either case though, the 10mm slim waistline will be much appreciated. And if you happen to have wide enough pockets, you?ll even be able to slip it in and not get much of bulge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak stands at 152.9 x 79.1 x 10 mm. The weight of 220 grams is about what you would expect from a device this size. It sure could?ve been lighter if everything was made of plastic, but we certainly welcome the extensive use of metal on the chassis.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Slim and metal-cast, the Dell Streak will make a good first impression. It was obvious this kind of size would tolerate no fancy designs and accents. They went for clean lines instead and that turned out to be a smart move, focusing all attention on the excellent build quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We certainly have our reservations about the red color of the review unit we received, but there are plenty of other paintjobs to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak offers very few keys on the front, reserving most of the space for the 5? display. 16M colors, capacitive overlay with multi-touch support and WVGA resolution is what you get here and it does sound good enough on paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life the touch experience is as smooth as you would expect. Capacitive screens are deservedly praised for their excellent response and the Dell Streak lives up to the expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the image quality isn?t quite as good with only average contrast and brightness. We never expected an LCD unit to rival SuperAMOLED blacks, but the Streak isn?t good enough at its own game either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility isn?t particularly impressive, although the device is reasonably usable in the bright sun. You will just have to work a bit harder to find the proper angle but, unlike some other devices, proper angles do exist. In this aspect the Dell Streak falls only slightly short of the Galaxy Tab and the Apple iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, or on its right side, if holding the device landscape, are the three capacitive keys: Menu, Back and Home. And by the way, landscape seems the intended way of working with the Streak ? judging by the orientation of the pictograms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on the Menu brings the search option while a long press on the Home button launches the task switcher/homescreen editor. The mouthpiece is in the bottom left corner at the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece, the proximity sensor and the front-facing camera. It can be used as a video-call camera but only in supported apps, like messengers for example. Otherwise the Streak doesn?t support video-calling over the cellular network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 30-pin connector goes on the left side of the Streak. The proprietary connector is probably the worst part of the hardware for two reasons. Firstly, it is incompatible with any other cable you might have (the 30-pin connectors of the iPad and the Galaxy Tab are incompatible either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other problem with this port is the huge and not particularly good looking gap it leaves on the side of the phone. There is no cap over it, making this part of the phone particularly unattractive to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the Dell Streak are completely bare with no controls or connectors whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right (top side, in landscape use), there are three keys: camera, power and volume rocker and the 3.5mm audio jack, which is, again, left exposed. The camera and power buttons are a tad too small for a device this size ? we did find them a bit fiddly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter is a two-stage button ? it can be half-pressed to lock focus. But overall, it?s not comfortable enough to work with ? mostly due to size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the dual LED flash. You can?t really expect much from a LED flash, but it can do the job for close-range shots. The loudspeaker grill is further down towards the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 1530 Li-Ion battery. Be warned that removing the rear cover will almost instantly cause the device to switch off. Quoted at up to 9 hours and 48 mins of talk time or 400 hours of standby, we really expected more from it. In reality, it?s worth just over a day of extensive use (two hours of browsing, a dozen of shots and a few calls, plus 30 minutes of fiddling with the rest of the phone apps). That?s all we managed to get out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the cover and even though it is accessible without removing the battery it?s actually non hot-swappable. It?s all due to the fact that the phone switches off when you release the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Streak is very well built and good looking too ? though, well, red is not its best color maybe ? at least not for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We enjoyed handling the device and even though it doesn?t feel quite as comfortable as a phone it is really compact and manageable for a tablet. Actually talking on the Streak doesn?t feel natural we think ? but it?s not something you need to do. Any sort of headset ? wired or wireless ? will do just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might think a 5? screen just can?t be too big ? after all there?s re enough phones out there with 4 and even 4.3-inch displays. In our humble opinion, 5-inch is across the line already. We mean calls only ? the size of the Dell Streak is otherwise right for watching videos or browsing the web. The middling screen quality and poor codec support are an entirely different mater though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s no denying that the Dell Streak?s user interface (much like the device itself) is easily standing out in the Android crowd. It takes no more than a glance to realize it?s the first ever Android designed with landscape operation in mind. And it does make sense too ? it feels much more natural holding the 5-inch Streak horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don?t get this wrong ? the menus have portrait mode as well and most apps that require vertical orientation work as they should but the homescreen is landscape only. So unless you want to constantly rotate the Streak back and forth, horizontal is the way to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dell made other customizations to the homescreen, too. You start with four screen panes (which Dell called rooms) to fill with widgets, shortcuts and folders but you can either increase that count to six or get rid of a few to speed up navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, Dell got rid of the single background (the extended wallpaper that underlies all the screens and scrolls slower than the icons on top to simulate a 3D homescreen). It?s only eye-candy but we really liked it and we do miss it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Needless to say, live wallpapers are not supported since our Dell unit is still stuck on Android 1.6 (Donut). If you get your hands on an Eclair tablet though, that should be fixed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu shortcut is moved to the top right corner this time, instead of its usual location at the bottom. By default it only shows you one row (which presumably contains your favorite apps) and you need to hit the more key for the full list of apps to appear. We don?t see much reason behind this as the part of the homescreen that is still visible in the single-line mode isn?t active. Anyway, since you only need to hit the more key once and it stays like that until next restart we aren?t going to complain much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab on top of the screen takes you to the task switcher/ homescreen editor. Mind you, you aren?t able to rearrange screens ? just add new ones or remove existing. Putting these two (the task switcher and the editor) together is strange enough in the first place as they have very little in common. It?s nothing you cannot get used to though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab is the notification area, which is as usually one of the nicest Android perks. Accessible from anywhere except fullscreen apps, it brings all things requiring your attention on screen with a single tap. Since the Streak isn?t a Froyo device just yet, there are no shortcuts to controlling the phone?s radios here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However Dell found a clever way around this and added those to a forth tab, along with battery status and a shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, we find the Dell reasonably comfortable to use and if you are a returning Android user you will get used to its quirks quickly enough. One problem is that the device doesn?t seem to be compatible with most of the alternative launchers that are found in the market so if you are into customizations you might have a harder time than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance, on the other hand, is pretty decent, though we have to admit we expected more from a Snapdragon on 512 MB of RAM. Actually the memory is more than sufficient but Donut obviously fails to bring out the best out of the CPU. It?s not burdensome or anything and, if you haven?t used a Froyo-powered device, you might not even notice it but the Streak doesn?t quite stand comparison to a Desire or a Nexus One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s certainly not as much difference as the following benchmarks show though. You might notice the huge gap there is between the Streak and the Galaxy Tab but in real life scenario it?s not as big in real life.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Streak phonebook has been visually customized and is fortunately one of the apps that will gladly go portrait when you rotate the phone. Unfortunately, its functionality falls a bit short of the best Android has to offer at this stage. The unlimited capacity and seamless sync are still here, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts get listed by first name and you have no power to change that, plus there?s no option to filter your SIM and phone contacts. However, you can still use groups to decide what gets displayed, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no alphabet scroll in portrait mode, which is strange given it works in landscape. Flick scrolling and searching through typing are available either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no quick contacts in Donut land but the Streak has a way around this ? and does even better ? placing the shortcuts next to the picture of each contact. The increased screen estate does count here obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact there are many info fields that you can assign, but everything remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the usual functionality such as adding a custom ringtone, picture or sending incoming calls straight to voicemail for any contact is available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It does look strange to hold a 5? device up to your head and talk, but it doesn?t cause any problems with the in-call experience. The earpiece is loud enough and the microphone is actually a couple of centimeters above the bottom edge so you can talk straight into it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, on the software side of things, the Streak fails to set the world alight. For starters it lacks smart dialing and we really appreciate that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the dial pad itself is hardly much of a looker. The Streak partly make up for that with an excellent voice recognition app, that?s fully speaker independent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log appears next to the dial pad and you get a shortcut to immediately dial one of the numbers there. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Dell Streak. It did pretty well grabbing a ?Very good? mark, which means that you will be easily able to hear it even in noisy environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: welcome to the large screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There aren?t too many custom elements to the Dell Streak messaging department so you are getting the usual Android straightforward approach ? no folders, just a new message button with all your threads listed underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since the text box with the message occupies only a part of the screen. Now, it?s a big enough screen but you still have a small part of the text to work with. At least adding a recipient is nice and easy, with a smart-dial-like suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, a text message is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input options, the Streak offers a couple of on-screen full QWERTY keyboards. As expected on a screen this size, even the portrait keyboard allows comfortable typing with large and well spaced keys. The design of the keyboard isn?t perfect but the screen estate and good sensitivity successfully conceal that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And you will be interested to know what they did with the place in landscape mode. Instead of making the keys too large, Dell added a numpad on the right so you don?t have to toggle between letters and numbers when you type. Again it?s hardly the best designed keyboard we have used but with such big screen you will be speeding your way through texts comfortably.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery?s good but for the banding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dell did a nice job customizing the Streak gallery, which hasn?t been an Android forte so far. The Streak allows you to see full resolution images instead of displaying downsized version only we see in some other Android smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dell also added some more eye-candy than usual with new 3D effects and some nice transitions. The different albums appear as stacks of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. Each time you select a stack from the gallery (that is automatically named after the folder) the background changes to a blurred version of one of the images within.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, locating all you images and videos and even Picasa syncing is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling full-screen photos is smooth and you can skip images without having to return to the default view. The pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Dell Streak multi-touch support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only problem with the Streak gallery is the very prominent banding. Obviously the gallery application doesn?t support 16M colors and that makes blue skies appear as a series of wide bands, which makes photo browsing a lot less fun.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tablets (and to a slightly lesser extent high-end smartphones) are expected to be good for watching videos on the go. Unfortunately the Streak failed to impress here, falling seriously short of most competitors ? phones and tablets alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, due to the limited codec support most of our test videos failed to run at all. There?s no DivX, XviD, MKV or whatever ? it?s basically MP4 or bust with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even if you are into converting your videos you won?t be getting a stunning performance either. VGA @ 30 fps was buttery smooth, but performance started to degrade rapidly from that point on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course with Froyo, things are expected to improve and with the Android Market at hand you can easily snatch a third party app to take care of those other codecs so it?s not a lost cause at all. 3rd party solutions do imply a performance sacrifice but we do believe the extra oomph Froyo brings will make up for that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Redesigned music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Streak music player got a new interface with two tabs on the start screen. The available filters (artists/albums/genres etc) are on the left, while recently added albums with their album art are listed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select your preferred filter, the whole screen gets filled with relevant content. You will need to go back though to sort by a different filter. The Galaxy Tab does have a more comfortable solution ? skipping that extra step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are very few options on the Streak player with equalizers completely absent. Searching for a song on YouTube or Google straight from the player is not enabled either. All you get here is shuffle and loop.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As is to be expected from a device with that kind of size and price tag, the Dell Streak did very well in our audio quality test. Its just as good as most of its competitors - both tablets and smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the Streak performs excellently when an external amplifier is used and there is only slight deterioration when headphones are attached. The stereo crosstalk reading took the biggest hit (but not as pronounced as on the Galaxy Tab), while the distortion increase is only detectable in lab conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dell Streak frequency response</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak packs a 5MP camera, which seems to be the norm for higher end Androids these days, but is the best you can get on a tablet. There?s also a dual-LED flash that makes it somewhat usable in low-light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is not particularly comfortable with more room available to the latest photos than the customizable settings. The recent pics have their own tab on the right, where the still camera/camcorder switch also goes, while the flash settings for example are only revealed after you slide the list to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side there are a good number of customizable settings, including brightness, contrast, white balance and flicker adjustment. Geotagging is also available as well as compression (quality) and resolution settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a dedicated shutter key too, which takes usability to a much higher level even with a screen this big. Touch focus however isn?t enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the images, captured with the Streak shooter is hardly impressive. Excessive sharpening, a distinct yellow tint and large noise patches plague the images. Fine detail is lost as a result of poorly tweaked noise-reduction. On the positive side contrast is good and even after the aggressive processing there?s enough detail left so we guess, the optics is pretty good quality too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Dell Streak. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video no longer cuts it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are a few dozens of 720p-recording devices out there so you can imagine why we aren?t particularly impressed with the Dell Streak?s VGA videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make it worse, the framerate isn?t particularly smooth, rarely exceeding 20 fps. The videos have the same yellow tint as the still photos and obviously suffer from compression. Resolved detail and dynamic range are mediocre and the interface is not particularly comfortable either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in out we wouldn?t recommend the Dell Streak to anyone that?s into recording videos. Even less so, considering that devices capable of capturing better video can be found for a fraction of the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dell Streak video sample</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation improves once the Dell Streak is updated to Android 2.1 Eclair/2.2 Froyo, which bump the video recording resolution to 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample found on YouTube, shot with a Dell Streak updated to Eclair. The frame rate hasn't improved and there's heavy rolling shutter effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak is a well equipped device that won?t let you down when it comes to securing an internet connection wherever you go. To begin with, there?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band 3G with network data speeds potentially reaching 7.2 Mbps for downloads and up to 5.76 Mbps for uploads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for local connectivity, you get Wi-Fi (b/g), Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The only things missing are Wi-Fi N connectivity or the latest Bluetooth 3.0. Those are still pretty rare anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Samsung Galaxy Tab (or the iPad), the Dell Streak uses a non-standard 30-pin port instead of microUSB. This could have been OK if Dell Streak had HDMI support. that?s not the case though and the only point is to limit users in their choice of accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak has no inbuilt storage but it supports microSD cards of up to 32GB. Dell were kind enough to drop a 16GB card in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity rundown. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Dell Streak hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser lacks Flash (for now)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser has always been an Android forte and under Froyo it?s probably the best you can get. Unfortunately, the Froyo update for Dell Streak is still to come and you?ll have to settle for a Donut browser and no Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Streak browser is similar to what you see on other Donut-running smartphones. All you get on the screen is the static address bar and four virtual controls around it ? back, forward, refresh and history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak offers only pinch-zooming, but we think it?s more than enough. It works like a charm, but what bothers us is the scrolling. Whether you have zoomed on the page or not, scrolling is really slow and in time this becomes quite irritating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall browser performance is a mixed-bag. Pages load very fast, but as you start hitting links there?s lagging and sluggish scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hitting the Menu key brings up a pop up menu to let you select text, search on page, manage your bookmarks, share the page, view downloads or the currently opened tabs, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark section keeps a list of the bookmarked pages and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history. The Window Overview shows thumbnails of your currently active tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing being the main reason to consider a tablet, we can conclude the Streak doesn?t quite stand comparison to the Galaxy Tab. There?s no Flash support, scrolling is slow and the overall performance is far from convincing. We know Froyo will address most of those issues, but the Streak should have been released with Android 2.1 or 2.2 in the first place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer package with some basic looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Remember the beautiful organizer on the Samsung Galaxy Tab? You may as well forget it. The Dell Streak?s PIM package looks like an old-school Windows Mobile UI (text on white background) . That?s what you get in the older Android we?re afraid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar, which can be easily synced with your Google account, allows you to create and manage events. You get the usual view modes available ? Monthly, Weekly and Daily. In addition you get the Agenda view, which brings all the events you?ve set in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. There is no support for Google locations though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak comes with QuickOffice pre-installed ? but it only works as a document viewer. You can?t select or copy text, the only option you get is search. At least, pinch-zooming works like a charm. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the Office viewer is excellent, but we really expected an editor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a voice recorder, calculator, Notes and Tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak features a decent alarm clock application, which allows you to set numerous alarms, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no file manager pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the YouTube app lets you watch YouTube videos without entering the browser. It?s got standard and high-quality settings, but even at the higher setting videos don?t get as good as on the iPad (which has no settings whatsoever).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market makes your phone better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The strength of an operating system lies in its app base and Android is hardly short of apps. The Dell Streak has access to the Android Market but it will only be able to take full advantage of it when it gets an upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the Market shows several featured apps. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs and each tab lists sub-categories (e.g. Finance applications, Arcade &amp; Action games). In each category you can select to view the top free, top paid apps or ones that are ?Just in?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a third tab ? Downloads ? that keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded. With Froyo you won?t need to keep too close an eye on this tab ? automatic updates are supported as long as you enable the feature. You can use the Downloads section to uninstall apps but it?s not the most comfortable way of doing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications range from pretty silly (including one that simulates a doorbell), through fun (e.g. a virtual guitar) to real must-have's (including alternative launchers, themes, navigation software and more).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Maps and navigation are the features where the 5-inch screen makes all the difference to phones. It comes as no surprise that Google Maps is the only mapping software to come preinstalled. Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation by Google Maps still has limited availability though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, unless you are in the lucky countries that do have Google Maps navigation already, you can either use the route planning to turn the Streak into a digital Map, which is reasonably easy to follow or grab a third-party solution off the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to Google Maps now and the Streak Street View mode support. With the large screen and the built-in compass you can enjoy a 360-degree view of an area of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one thing missing on the Dell Streak?s Google Maps ? the multi-touch support. There is no pinch-zooming so you have to rely on double taps or the dedicated zooming controls at the bottom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Dell Streak is trying to find the best balance between smartphone and tablet in a place where no one else has looked. The hardware certainly seems up to the task, matching the best the market has to offer. Or so it seems when you look at the specs sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it?s the performance that counts here and the Dell Streak is not quite as smooth as we are used to seeing from Android ? especially at this price point. Of course this is in no small part due to the outdated Android version. As soon as the Streak gets Froyo, things might just take a turn for the better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now, we can?t help but feel that it?s some way behind both its smartphone and its tablet competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7? Galaxy Tab seems to better fit the tablet bill and still packs a camera and full phone capabilities. We recently got the chance to review it and the only grudge we had was the high price tag. Unfortunately, the Dell Streak doesn?t exactly go for pennies either.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>And the high-end smartphone market has never been more competitive with makers trying to outdo each other in releasing better featured and better built devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just think about it ? there?s nothing that the Streak offers that can top the HTC Desire HD, but screen estate. The Desire HD on the other hand has Froyo with the functionality boost implied, more RAM, a standard port, etc. It?s way more pocketable too ? though by no means small with that 4.3? screen. And it?s got a better camera with HD video recording.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Of course, it might be just us but 5? does seem stuck in the middle of nowhere: it?s either a huge phone or a tablet too small. Of course, if a 5? device can do both jobs for you, you might just go ahead and buy it. Once thing?s for sure ? you can count on rock solid build quality with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re lucky enough to get an software upgrade soon ? it will be a buy you?re unlikely to regret. We?re just not sure. We?ve always thought that tablets are supposed to let you leave your laptop at home. With the Dell Streak however goes the other way ? it will let you leave your phone at home and that?s all.</paragraph>
