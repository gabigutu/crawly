			<paragraph>What's better than a Walkman music player by your side while running in the park? Well, there is one and that is to have a Walkman phone and a pedometer in an all-in-one pack. Well, you've guessed it; it's the Sony Ericsson W710, the latest Walkman mobile phone from Sony Ericsson. The clamshell sports a 2 megapixel camera, a Memory Stick Micro memory card slot, a FM radio, and a set of nice fitness applications to store your results and to calculate how many calories you have burned on the track that day. It's a highly attractive combination that makes the first steps for Sony Ericsson on the mobile sports track. We'll see how it keeps up there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W710 is one of those rare sport-oriented mobiles that have begun to emerge on the market recently. They seem to have a market niche of their own and though they are few in numbers, they are beginning to gain popularity. Several manufacturers already have recognized the need for those kinds of mobile phones. The truth is that as we begin to see the mobile phone as an indispensable part of our everyday lives, it would develop more and more to cover a broader part of our everyday technological needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we are speaking of sports, the other recent phone that first comes to mind is most definitely the Nokia 5500 Sport. But we won't compare the two phones as we don't perceive them as direct competitors. First, Nokia 5500 has a dust and splash resistant body, and furthermore it is based on the Symbian OS and thus it offers more versatile and expandable software capabilities. In the same time, it costs more. So they are not really direct competitors since they are targeted at different customer groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first sport-oriented handsets in fact were the ones with a body with increased resistance to moisture and dust. This is not the case with Sony Ericsson W710 although it features some sporty design solutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it happens often in the mobile world, the W710 in fact has a twin - it is the Sony Ericsson Z710. Sony Ericsson tends to keep up their budget-oriented Z-series of clamshells and Sony Ericsson Z710 is one of its latest additions. The two handsets are practically identical except for the added Walkman features to the W710 such as the MegaBass equalizer preset and the TrackID function, as well as the sports features such as the pedometer and calories counter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W710 would be offered in two color combinations - a grey/white one and a violet/white one. The one we got to test was the grey/white one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail package should include a 512MB Memory Stick Micro card, a sports Sony Ericsson HPM-65 stereo headset, a sports belt/armband clip, an armband and a USB data cable card but as we have always said - the contents of the retail package are market and country dependant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sporty all around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Seeing W710 for the first time left us with an impression of cheap white plastic combined with unpretentious grey rubber - nothing fancy, really. Opening the clamshell, made things better, since the white plastic seemed glossy from the inside of the clam, while the grey plastic covering the insides felt and looked nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W710 clamshell opened</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to dimensions, well? There's nothing impressive in that department too. The W710 is a rather fatty fellow with a width of 24.5 mm - but despite the size, it still doesn't fit into the heavyweight category with its 101 g which is a somewhat normal weight these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Sony Ericsson W710 is dominated by the large monochrome external display which can fit a lot of information for the user. The Walkman logo sits right beneath it and the grey rubber on both sides accommodates the dedicated music keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W710 front view ? external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, speaking of those side music keys they tend to resemble a lot the ones incorporated into the Nokia 5300 Xpress Music. Maybe because of the similar color combination (white/grey) we just couldn't help the feeling that these two are as if made by one and the same designer team.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A look at the left side reveals that they are not the only side keys though. There we also see a dual volume key and the camera shortcut key. Placing the camera key on the left side hinted us from the very beginning that the camera is not made to shoot in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting element is the one under the side music keys - the one designated with the Memory Stick Micro logo. Although it resembled a memory card slot cap a lot it turned out it's a dummy cap after all and it only designates where the memory card is located. To gain access to it you have to remove the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Left hand side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of a camera, this one is located on the usual place for all clamshells - in the upper portion of the external cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  2 megapixel camera lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the W710 incorporates only the Infrared port and a hardware keylock for the dedicated music keys. It's a nice feature and it does a good job in preventing unwanted press of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Right hand side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson doesn't have a dedicated standard audio jack. Instead it uses the proprietary Sony Ericsson Fast Port for connecting the charger, the headphones and the USB cable. Don't get disappointed though, you would still be able to use your favorite headphones with it since the headset supplied in the retail kit has a standard audio jack connector just for the purpose. The top of the W710 doesn't feature any keys at all but it does feature an important design element that we are so used to see in the Z-series line-up - an external loop antenna which can be used for strip fastening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standard Fast Port ? external antenna</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Ericsson W710 is bare with the exception of the loudspeaker grill which is styled in orange. The cover is made of the same white pearl shiny plastic that we see when the clamshell is opened. As expected from a sports oriented mobile, the cover has a rather secure locking mechanism which is opened with a slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   W710 back cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the cover we can see the standard Sony Ericsson BST-37 Li-Polymer battery with a capacity of 900 mAh. According to the manufacturer it should provide power for up to the impressive 350 hours of standby time and up to 10 hours of talk time. Unfortunately, we couldn't test the phone's battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced was not indicative for the real-life performance of the phone. Beneath the battery lies the SIM card bed which features the regular locking mechanism seen on almost all Sony Ericsson mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Under the battery cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W710 has a rather nice keypad that would suit the taste of every messaging fan. The navigation D-pad is precise enough while the alphanumeric keys have a rather positive feedback while typing. Beside the usual key arrangement, the keypad also features a dedicated Walkman key. The keypad has a dim orange backlighting which is unpleasantly uneven but does its job in the dark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two sparkling displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The external STN display of the W710 is rather large with a diagonal of 1.5" and a resolution of 128 x 128 pixels. It's inverted monochrome one with an orange backlighting and is perfectly readable under direct sunlight. It has rich functions - from displaying the caller ID to the sports applications to detailed information from the music player or the FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  External display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display is a 262K colors TFT one, measuring 1.9 inch in diagonal and has a resolution of 175 x 220 pixels. It's on par with the one used in Sony Ericsson W800 for example. It's legibility under direct sunlight poses no problem at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main display in the dark</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Peripherals do matter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a sports oriented model, the Sony Ericsson W710 comes equipped with a set of sports accessories such as a belt clip, an arm band and sports headset. The belt clip is made of white plastic which seems strong enough to keep the mobile in its place during your morning runs. It clips straight to the mobile and holds it in four spots. When the belt clip is on, the handset can be carried in a vertical or horizontal position - the clip provides for that. A great thing about it though is that it is not just a simple belt clip but also an armband clip and using both accessories you can carry the phone firmly fastened to you arm. During our test though it turned out that the armband itself is too short for a large men's arm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W710 belt clip</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset that comes with the W710 is not your usual Walkman handset. The exact model is Sony Ericsson HPM-65 stereo headset. The main difference with the usual HPM-82 model is the hooks that allow for a more firm fastening onto the ears. In terms of quality they seem just a little bit inferior to the HPM-82.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  W710 headset</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, we are quite pleased with the ergonomics of the mobile. It's easy to get used to. The dedicated music keys seem rather intuitively placed and the clamshell mechanism seems stable and works fine. And as strange as it may sound, when held to your ear the Sony Ericsson W710 feels more comfortable than most of the clamshells that we have reviewed lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   W710 held in hand</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>More than comfortable, more than reliable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that we are quite pleased with the user-friendliness of the W710 design. Using it for what it's made for - making calls comes as easy as ever. The reception signal is of good quality in all recent mobiles, so we wouldn't expect any less than that from the W710.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It met all our other expectations too, since it played out its ringtones loud enough to be heard even in a noisy street, and the vibration is strong enough as well. The loudspeaker produces sound with no hissing or buzzing even at the loudest volume levels, but it must be noted that it lacks certain bass elements. But that's really ok for a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calling our friend Dexter</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice and cozy from the inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in W710 is a standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson user interface. This is the reason why we would use some excerpts from our previous reviews of Sony Ericsson phones. Of course, we would use the screenshots from W710 for illustration and the text would take into account all the interface specifics of this model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice thing is that the phone has a dedicated Flight mode, which can be turned on seamlessly without even turning the phone off. Even if you have to turn it off for some reason, there is an option that the phone asks you whether you want to start it directly into Flight mode. The phone cannot work in Flight mode unless there is a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Turning the phone on</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm that's due to go off. You can choose to display the clock with large semi-transparent numbers, which take up half the screen but blend with the chosen wallpaper very well. A good thing is that you can set the clock to be seen in the upper right angle of the screen even while browsing through the menu. An interesting addition to the stand-by screen is the pedometer output which states how many step you have made today. The external display shows almost the same info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standby view: two types of clock ? external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the navigation pad in any of the four directions can start a given feature or application according to the user preference. In fact when you start using the phone for the first time, the phone reminds you of that option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Create shortcuts to the pad's four ways</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu itself is made of a matrix grid with 4 x 3 animated icons. All sub-menus are in listed view with tiny icons on the left side. The phone reacts and performs fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The main menu ? a listed sub menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several themes that come preinstalled in the phone. They change the color scheme, the wallpaper and the menu icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main menu icons: two of the preinstalled themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the things, that have been developed a lot, is the Activity menu which has a dedicated shortcut key on the keypad. The Now running tab of the menu offers real multi-tasking. In W800 you could only run simultaneously one regular application and one Java application, for example. Now you can run three Java applications in the same time, which allows for a lot more freedom and flexibility in everyday usage. For example, you can open the browser, open an instant messenger client, listen to the radio and play a game, all at the same time. That's a great functionality that is not seen in other non-OS phones of other manufacturers. The rest of the functionality of the Activity menu has remained the same - it offers quick access to recent events, the web menu with integrated Google search and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of frequently used features and can be modified to the user preference.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook scores nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and easy to use. As always, it asks you whether you would like to copy your contacts from the SIM card to the phone's memory. However you can choose either the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be the default for the phonebook. Both lists cannot be displayed simultaneously. Otherwise, a nice option is that you can make the phone to autosave to the SIM card any new contacts that you save in the phone's memory. You can also have the phone back up your phone numbers on the inserted memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Contacts list ? Phonebook options ? Choosing default contacts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts but you can save up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. Contacts are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Free memory status ? Sorting names</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are five possibilities for the phone number: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture and a custom ringtone. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. When you add the birth date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and put a reminder for it. That's a good feature and we like that we see it available more and more often in current phones. When you are browsing your phonebook list, switching between different phone numbers and emails for a given contact is possible via pushing the side ways of the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact details</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided in four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs altogether contain up to 30 call records, which are shared between the separate tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calls log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple as that<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the common Inbox. Only email messages have their own separate Inbox. There is a My Friends feature, which works like an instant messaging application and can be used if your network operator supports it. The phone also offers a RSS feeds reader that in fact uses the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messaging menu ? RSS feeds</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start typing a message, first you must choose from the four variants: Text message, Picture message, Voice message or Email. There is no point in that as you can easily transform a SMS into a MMS along the way by simply attaching multimedia objects to the message. There is a character counter, which activates when you reach 20 characters before the 160 limit. When you pass the limit a "2 SMS" warning sign comes up for a second to alert you that the message will be divided in two parts. Of course, there is the T9 dictionary to assist the typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Write new ? typing a SMS ? available symbols ? copy/paste options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports POP3 and IMAP protocols. It can also manage several accounts simultaneously. You can choose from downloading only headers or headers and text. The phone can automatically check for new emails at a preset interval. Sony Ericsson W710 also has support for Push email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Email inbox ? reading your welcome email ? changing font size</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Playing some sounds and videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W710 supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI file formats. The Walkman media player is version 1.0 and doesn't boast the improved interface 2.0 which at the time this review was written was only available in W850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has several equalizer presets including the proprietary Mega Bass. It can be set to run in background so you can do other things with the phone while listening to music. When in background mode, there is an indication of the name of the song and artist of the track currently playing in the top part of the main display as well as on the external display. The control of the player is intuitive and really easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Music player menu ? Artists submenu ? player options ? Mega Bass preset</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of the player is the same as the one used on previous models so users should be already quite used to it. The sound is nice, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Playing a track ? Sending a file from within the player ? the external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of W710 is really too basic and offers almost no special options. It cannot even play videos in landscape mode. There isn't even a noticeable difference when playing videos in fullscreen and windowed mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Playing a video ? Video player options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio has a memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS. The current selected station shows on the external display too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Picking up frequencies ? tuning in a station ? external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio also features the TrackID option which records several seconds from the song you are listening to at the moment, connects to the Gracenote servers and should hopefully identify it for you. So if you happen to hear a great song on the radio you can always get the name and artist. Unfortunately, the TrackID more often didn't work successfully when we tried it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Files and stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have used other Sony Ericsson handsets you won't be surprised by the W710 file manager because there are no significant improvements here. On the other hand if you are still new to SE phones, well let me tell you that they have one of the best non-OS file managers. It allows you to mark files (single or multiple), copy them, move them, and also create and delete folders as you please. There are three tabs of file lists - one for the phone memory files, one for the memory stick files and one mutual for all files. By selecting a given tab you can filter the files shown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The memory card tab ? available memory space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your pictures is as easy as ever - you could do that in a list view with or without thumbnails while the file names are visible. You can also choose to view your pictures as a grid matrix of thumbnails in 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 grids with no file names visible. The video files can also be browsed as thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    List view ? thumbnails list view ? 3 x 3 grid view? 2 x 2 grid view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the only available option for viewing pictures fullscreen is vertically (in portrait mode). When viewing the pictures one by one the phone preloads a lower quality preview in order to allow you fast browsing. Once you find a picture, you would like to see it in its full glory you should stop browsing for a second and the phone would load it with its normal quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Viewing the pictures only in portrait mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While browsing pictures you can easily do a little bit of editing on them or send them as MMS and email or via Bluetooth and Infrared. If you intend to do detailed editing of the picture, the PhotoDJ application is at your disposal. With its help you can easily adjust levels, light balance, brightness and contrast, remove unwanted red-eye effect, apply some color effects to the picture such as negative and sepia, or you can add a frame or a text to the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sending options ? Editing options</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2 megapixels on a budget<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera of W710 does its job satisfactory without any bells and whistles. The quality of the pictures taken is comparable to that of pictures taken with Sony Ericsson K610.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen better quality cameras from Sony Ericsson, not to mention the lack of autofocus. The camera offers night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, and burst shooting modes. It also features white balance correction. Several color effects are available, too. When it comes to orientation, the camera can only take pictures in portrait (vertical) mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera viewfinder ? some camera menu options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W710 has no dedicated macro mode, everything closer than, say 80 cm from the lens will be out of focus. The camera menu is far simpler than the one seen on handsets such as K750, K610, W810, etc. It's more like the one used on budget models such as Sony Ericsson K510 and its predecessor K500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors in the W710 photos are quite correct; the resolution is not bad at all. As a whole the photo quality of W710 is just a tad worse than the W850 model we reviewed recently. It looks like Sony Ericsson uses different image processing in W710 than it's best photo models, like K800, W810 and the likes. The W710 images look artificially noise free, but this comes at a price. The noise suppressing routines smear fine details like the foliage of a tree. Look at distant trees in our samples and you will agree that they look strange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Sony Ericsson W710 sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with W710 are captured at the low QCIF resolution. You can choose if you would like to limit the video duration in order to fit it on a MMS message or whether you would like to make unlimited recordings. The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences. It's possible to use digital zoom during recording, but the key presses get recorded too loudly, as seen in our sample video.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plugged and unplugged<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides GPRS and EDGE for fast data transfers, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as USB support, Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we tested, the integrated HTML Access NetFront Internet browser is at a good level and it does its job more than alright. It has a lot of options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser manages well with fitting the web content into the screen, but usually distorts the page layout and design too much to be really useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cannot miss the opportunity to take a peek at GSMArena.com through the integrated browser since that has become in some way our in-house way of testing and comparing mobile Web browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is that the browser supports zooming in and out of the Web pages of up to 200%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Zooming out to 50% ? zooming in on 150% ? zooming in on 100%</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset supports Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP profile, which means that you could use a stereo Bluetooth headset with it and that is something you don't see in every phone nowadays. Another notable thing about the excellent Bluetooth support is the Human Interface Device (HID) profile which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Further on, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for Internet access of a PC or a mobile computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The integrated "Remote" application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has support for local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC while the remote synchronization is with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has two modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem. A great feature that we see in every new Sony Ericsson phone nowadays is the capability to update the firmware version of the phone over-the-air, meaning you can download the new version through the phone itself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organize it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone offers many time organizing features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Alarms, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily view. As we mentioned before, when you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone asks you if you wish to add it in the calendar too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Organizer menu ? Calendar monthly view, weekly view &amp; daily view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Reminders can be put as Subjects. Notes are written as messages; there even is the T9 to assist writing. There are five alarms available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat it on chosen days of the week or everyday. Furthermore, you can add text and a picture to the alarm as well as set its behavior in case the time that the alarm is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Alarms menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder doesn't have any limit in the duration of the recordings since all the free memory is available for the purposes of the application. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one, which you have probably already seen. It offers the basic functions with no bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Voice recorder ? Calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include the MusicDJ, VideoDJ and the Music Mate. VideoDJ is for making video clips from scratch or for editing existing recording using special transition effects and by adding background music. It can be a very amusing application. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   VideoDJ application ? MusicDJ application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Mate application is designed for those aspiring to become musicians. It offers a guitar chords database, a piano pitch and a metronome. You can use the database to check the finger composition for any guitar chord, as well as hear how it sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Music Mate application</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Running and walking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walk Around the World application presents keen walkers with information approximately how many days would it take them to walk to some of the biggest world cities. According to us it's quite useless, but amusing, at least when you try it for the first time. An interesting thing is that the figures are dynamic and are based on your personal average walking speed for a given period of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Walk around the world</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another unusual application sports oriented application was the Pocket Trainer. It's pedometer oriented and uses it to calculate your speed and training session results. It can even draw graphs and make statistics about your performance for a given period.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Your results and graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough it even has a Trivia section where you get to win medals for answering correctly sports oriented questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Trivia and your earned medals</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The place where the Pocket Trainer application gets its data from is in fact the sports menu when you find all the practical everyday sports oriented features of the Sony Ericsson W710. The mobile stores information about your training sessions or about your casual walking. You can browse that information for the current day or for past days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some of the results</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sports menu is also the place where you would find the circuit chronometer/speedometer to assist you in your laps. When you start it, you are asked to close the clamshell and start running.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tons of games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are unusually many preinstalled games on the phone. Those are Alien Scum, Alpha Wing 2, Erix, Five Stones, QuadraPop, SoccerPong, Tennis, and Treasure Towers. We won't go into details about them, just have a look at some of the screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Alien Scum ? Alpha Wing 2 ? Tennis ? Treasure Towers</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being among the few sports-oriented mobile phones on the market, the Sony Ericsson W710 deserves a nice score just for the efforts the manufacturer has put in it and the risk taken. Nevertheless, we find the W710 to be an excellent implementation of a mobile phone, a portable music player, a personal digital trainer and a digital camera all-in-one. It's not a high-end device and it's not meant to be one. It's meant for fun and it manages to deliver what's expected . We at GSMArena.com would like to see more devices of that sort coming out on the market and competing for the hearts of the sports oriented audience. Because W710 surely managed to warm ours.</paragraph>
