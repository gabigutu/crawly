			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M4 Aqua is Sony's take on what a mid-ranger should look like. And for the first time in a while it has got us excited. It has all the right specs coupled with a thin profile and premium looks, all bundled up into a ?299 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And did we mention this smartphone is waterproof like its more expensive siblings? Oh well, we guess the name should have given it away by now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For extra flexibility the Xperia M4 Aqua is also available as a Dual SIM phone under the name Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual. It's slightly more complicated than that as both devices have their regional versions. These are mostly the same, save for the LTE connectivity, which lacks on one of the Xperia M4 Aqua Dual models (E2312). The rest all ship with LTE, but with varying band support depending on the intended regions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So many bands and so many markets - it's always hard to keep track of the different models, but the important core specs are the same and here's a short list of the main points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 29 May 2015: This review was originally based on a pre-production review unit, but now all tests including the camera samples have been redone using a retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, once you dig deeper, a lot of the phone's true mid-range character starts to show. It runs on the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 SoC, which is an excellent choice but not flagship grade. The 13MP camera lacks 2160p video recording. The phone also only comes with 8GB of internal space, which will definitely fill-up quick. Thankfully, there is a microSD card slot, but a lot of current apps still prefer the on-board storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M4 Aqua doesn't really have any major flaws, but it is the subject of a serious case of sibling rivalry In the face of the Xperia Z3 Compact. You can pick the smaller form factor of Sony's current flagship for just a bit more than the M4 Aqua and it comes packing some serious processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design-wise, the phone bears a lot of signature Sony elements and definitely draws inspiration from the Xperia Z3. But while the premium looks are there, some compromises have been made with materials, perhaps to keep cost down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But cheer up as the M4 Aqua has its merits. It looks good and performs well, the real question is whether this is enough to make it a viable choice. Stick around for the rest of the review, as we intend to find out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like to elaborate everything in detail, but if reading through the full 10-page review is not your thing, our video review below should get you through the most important points about the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua in under 4 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us to the next page for an overview of the design.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M4 Aqua boasts a slick exterior. It is quite thin and has that very distinctive Sony look.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no point in beating about the bush, the Xperia M4 Aqua is a spitting image of the Xperia Z3. Sony was quite obviously going for that quite-recognizable premium look of the flagship and there really shouldn't be any shame in this approach. Moreover, the M4 Aqua really pulls it off marvelously. One could easily mistake the couple at first glance, as even their dimension are almost exactly identical - 145.5 x 72.6 x 7.3 mm for the M4 Aqua, as opposed to 146 x 72 x 7.3 mm on the Z3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M4 has the same overall appearance, down to every corner and groove of the device. Build quality seems to be comparable as well. Everything on the M4 Aqua is nicely put together and fits snugly and it really has to, considering the IP68 dust and water proof certification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Materials, however, differ greatly between the two devices, although Sony has managed to mask the differences incredibly well. Upon first contact you could easily be fooled that the M4 comes with a metal frame, like the Z3, but it is, in fact a very convincing polycarbonate. Actually, it looks and feels so good, that we can't really find any faults with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has also underwent a material substitution. Instead of the glass finish on the Xperia Z3, the M4 Aqua is adorned with an equally stylish plastic equivalent. It also looks almost identical and definitely gives the impression of glass. Sadly, it keeps just as many fingerprints as well. We did also notice a give when pushing down on the back of the device, but it is definitely nothing to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, Sony has really done the best it could with the available materials and add some. The body feels nice to the touch and the plastic does not look cheap in any way. The M4 Aqua comes in three colors - black, white and a pink one, called coral.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is equipped with a 5.0-inch display, with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. It has a pixel density of 294 ppi, which is slightly lower than the one on the Z3 Compact - 319 ppi and worlds away from the 424 ppi of the Z3. The bezels on the device are also quite big, but they are not bothersome, especially on a black unit. The smaller 5.0-inch screen in what is essentially a Z3-sized body leads to a screen-to-body ratio of about 65.2%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, the earpiece features a grill design, again similar to the Z3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP front-facing camera is slightly off to the right. The phone does not feature any physical buttons, so the area below the display is mostly empty, except for the mouthpiece, which is identical in design to the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going round the device, we find the left side housing only a microUSB port and a flap to cover the microSD card slot. It is evident that Sony has applied some additional waterproof coating to the microUSB port, as it is sitting out in the open, without the need to be protected by an additional cover, like on the Z3, for example. This is significantly more convenient for charging and Sony guarantees that it is just as waterproof as its old solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side is a little bit more-cluttered. At the top there is a flap. Covering the single or dual Nano-SIM slots. There is the signature round Power/Lock button, conveniently placed slightly above the middle of the device and, below it, a slim volume rocker. Near the bottom, there is a very thin and almost unnoticeable dedicated camera shutter button. It makes taking photos all that more-convenient - especially underwater where the capacitive touchscreen gets confused.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed on the top of the device near the right corner. Next to it is the secondary noise-canceling microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Xperia M4 Aqua houses the main microphone and a speaker. They are spaced out as far as possible and shouldn't get in the way easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back, we find a slick plastic finish, quite reminiscent of glass and equally prone to smudging. It houses only the 13MP main camera and a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, there is a Sony brand as well as an Xperia brand on the bottom and a little NFC logo. Actually, the back of the M4 Aqua is so similar to the one on the Z3 that it is almost indistinguishable. The only difference is the camera text on the Z3, but you really have to know what to look for to notice. Well, that and you can also probably spot the perfectly flat glass on the Z3. Under light, you can spot a slight unevenness of the Xperia M4 Aqua back surface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is equipped with a pretty simple IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. With a diagonal of 5.0-inches, it sits right between the Z3 Compact with its 4.6-inches and the Z3, which is slightly bigger, at 5.2-inches. Both the M4 Aqua and the Z3 Compact have 720p screens, which is yet another similarity that pits the two devices against one another on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z3 Compact does, however, boast a slightly higher ppi rating, as well as a better screen-to-body ratio. Luckily, the M4 Aqua does have the added benefit of Sony's Triluminos display technology and Bravia tech that enhances colors and contrast by clever processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is fitted with an IPS LCD panel with an RGB matrix. It really doesn't look all that impressive on paper, but our test reveal that this is one of the better Sony panel we have ever seen. It has a relatively high maximum brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blacks are not as deep as we like them, but that's just nitpicking. Viewing angles are also superb, with almost no distortion in the image and only a slight loss of brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is good at max brightness, so we are quite happy with the display and its performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>M4 Aqua battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has put a 2,400mAh battery inside the Xperia M4 Aqua, which is smaller than both the Xperia Z3 Compact and the Z3 flagship. The Snapdragon 615 should be more power-efficient than the more powerful 800 series in the other devices, so battery life might not be so dependent on battery capacity alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our battery test with the battery-saving STAMINA mode off. But, even without the extra help, the handset scored a whopping overall endurance rating of 81 hours. This is quite impressive and surpasses the M2 Aqua by a good ten hours. It is even up to par with the Xperia Z3, which boasts a rating of 85 hours. Still, however, it is hard to get anywhere near the Z3 Compact and its outrageous 101 hours. If you are keen on battery life, the M4 Aqua definitely doesn't disappoint, but the Z3 Compact is undoubtedly even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our pre-production unit did have some problems with endurance, but, everything seems to be cleared up now. Since then, standby time has doubled and so has browsing time. The bundled chrome browser now performs wonderfully, as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery pack itself is not user-removable, which seems to be the common case with a lot of current devices. At least, the M4 Aqua has a good reason for not breaking the tight seal on the back, seeing how the device is meant to feel at home in water.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless of the battery life we'll get, you can always rely on the Power Saver - now part of the settings menu. It helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically, as soon as the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also choose to automatically turn Wi-Fi off if there is no known Wi-Fi network in range or switch off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua comes in single and dual SIM flavors. Both the M4 Aqua and the M4 Aqua Dual offer quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE/HSDPA support. LTE support is also present, courtesy of the Snapdragon 615 SoC except for one of the submodels (E2312) of the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual, which is 3G only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity features dial-band Wi-Fi b/g/n and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.1 with A2DP. Satellite navigation is also a given, with additional A-GPS and GLONASS support. The Xperia M4 Aqua also has an FM radio with RDS. It doesn't offer an IR port, but it does come with NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections and now, thanks to special coating, it is no longer covered by a flap. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over the USB cable. USB host functionality is also present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port doesn't have any TV-out functionality, unlike the Z3 Compact, which supports MHL, but if you own a compatible HDTV, you can output your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol or Sony's Xperia Connectivity Throw option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also lets you share your media over DLNA by creating a media server, as well as connect to a PlayStation DUALSHOCK 3 (or 4) wireless controller.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Lollipop with a pinch of Xperia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony only recently made the move to Android Lollipop and for quite a while, we were left with the impression that only the premium Z-line would be getting the OS update. We are happy to report that the M4 Aqua also came with Android 5.0 out-of-the-box. This was not the case with recent entry-level devices we have reviewed, like the Xperia E4 and E4g, but, it seems the new mid-rangers have made the cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, even though we're running the latest currently available (and final) firmware for our pre-release Xperia M4 Aqua, it's possible that there will be certain differences in how a retail version of the smartphone handles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the launcher goes, Sony has gone to great lengths to preserve its signature look and feel. If you are transitioning from a KitKat Xperia, you will instantly feel that almost everything is right where you remember, just with a fresher material-design look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This even extends to the bundled application. Most of them are also practically untouched as far as navigation and UX goes, but now employ all the extra visual eye-candy of Android Lollipop. This kind of transition really takes effort and is definitely worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has undergone some changes with Android 5.0. There are no more lockscreen widgets available, apart, of course, from a selection of clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multiple panes have been removed as well. There are still quick shortcuts to launch the dialer and camera, which are now at the bottom left and right corners, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five homescreen panels by default and you can set any of them as your primary one. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme. You can also choose which icons will be visible on the status bar, and which should remain hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is no longer arranged it two tabs. It uses the standard Lollipop-style pull-down effect with multiple levels. Quick settings are on the top and notifications on the bottom. The aforementioned can be accessed by swiping from the top twice, but Sony has also preserved its two-finger swipe gesture, which extends the full shade in one stroke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles are customizable and you can choose between a total of 13 and have up to 9 of them visible. Their order can be adjusted manually, or you can leave that to Lollipop, which will automatically rearrange them according to frequency of use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps in various ways. The settings for that are accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there, as well as download new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M4 Aqua uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between the recently opened apps, as well as terminate any of them with a side-swipe. In Lollipop in features a lot more animation and also shows browser tabs as separate apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia M4 Aqua and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of five of those available: Active Clip, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Timer and Touch Block. Interestingly enough, we have seen a number of other apps on Xperia devices, like- Chrome Bookmarks, Gmail, Notes and Recorder, which are missing on the M4 Aqua. On the other hand, Touch Block is something we haven't seen on other devices, which is kind of odd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, you can't disable the small apps entirely and will always have them cramming your recent apps whether you use them or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in 8GB (about 4GB of which are user accessible) of storage gets filled up pretty quickly and the Xperia M4 Aqua needs a microSD card to help carry the load. Unfortunately, some apps will still refuse installing on the external storage so it's best that you grab the 16GB version to begin with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is no powerhouse and its specs shout mid-range all-around. It is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 SoC, which was created specifically to target the mid-range market. It consists of a total of eight Cortex A53 cores, four clocked at 1.5GHz and the other four at 1.0Ghz. This doesn't sound very impressive, but Sony has managed to optimize the OS for a fluent and pleasant experience all around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with 2GB of RAM, which is more than enough for most everyday tasks and with an Adreno 405 GPU casual gaming is also a fluent and pleasant experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This being said, the Xperia M4 Aqua has a lot of competition. With decent hardware and a price tag of around ?300, it is a solid phone. But, there are a lot of alternatives which offer similar and often better performance for around the same price. We have made a mixed selection of the two for our benchmark section. Naturally, we have thrown the Xperia Z3 Compact in the mix, which seems to be quite popular among Sony fans, but seeing how it is powered by a Snapdragon 801 SoC, there shouldn't be much competition in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3, which should be straight-forward enough, but does show some surprising results. The Xperia M4 Aqua sits around the middle of the scoreboard, which is expected, but it is being surpassed by a few, less-than-predictable opponents. The Samsung Galaxy Alpha with its Exynos 5 Octa 5430 SoC sits at the very top, but, it is followed very closely by the Galaxy A7, which is equipped with the exact same MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chip as the Xperia M4 Aqua.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones are strikingly similar in terms of hardware, so the only explanation of the major difference in performance is software optimization, which Samsung seems to have handled amazingly well. The Galaxy A7 even outperforms the Xperia Z3 Compact, which has a Snapdragon 801 inside, albeit a slightly older version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind, that the Galaxy was tested while running of Android 4.4 KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Predictable enough, the M4 Aqua surpassed the quite aging original Moto X and the LG G2, although not by a lot. And the Galaxy A5, S4 and S5 mini are all left behind, seeing how they all sport slower processors, but are, in fact, in the same price range as the Xperia M4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. Here we see pretty much the same arrangement. The Galaxy Alpha and Z3 Compact both have a major lead and the M4 Aqua and its hardware doppelganger - the Galaxy A7 are neck to neck, but now, with a slight edge for the Xperia. So, the Sony seems to beat most of its competition in terms of overall performance, which is great news, seeing how CPU power alone doesn't really help you do your work more-efficiently.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. We focus on the overall score and the dedicated CPU scores. The Xperia M4 Aqua once again performs admirably well. It seems to lack behind in single-core performance, but it makes up with great optimization in multi-core. After factoring in a lot of other performance factors, Basemark OS ranks the phone well above its direct hardware rivals, which is great news.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to pure graphics tests, the Xperia M4 Aqua does fairly well. Its Adreno 405 GPU isn't really all that powerful, but the phone's 720 x 1280 screen resolution allow for some decent framerates onscreen. Offscreen, however, it's a whole different story. The M4 Aqua struggles quite badly with the test and comes in near the bottom of the chart.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M4 Aqua didn't really shine in the browser test either. Still, it did alright. Chrome is pulling its own weight. The Kraken score wasn't all that great, but BrowserMark is perfectly fine for a mid-range device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua works quite well. The Snapdragon 615 scores some 70% better than the omnipresent Snapdragon 410 chipset so the Xperia M4 Aqua has that going for it. Best of all, the phone performs quite in line with what other smartphones with Snapdragon 615 offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware inside the M4 Aqua is quite capable, not to mention futureproof, so there is really no reason for the device to punch below its category. We are quick to point the finger at Sony, which is all but justified, but Android 5.0 hasn't really been playing well with a lot of devices recently. Bugs are still present across quite a few devices from various manufacturer, so there is still a lot of room for improvement on Google's latest mobile OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contacts app uses a tabbed interface, consisting of Contacts, Favorites and Groups. It is no longer bundled with the phone app, but you can still quickly jump to it from the dialer. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers a very nicely animated alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are using two SIM cards, every time you want to make a call you'll be asked to choose which SIM card to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is available, the quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua was able to hold onto signal very well. Calls remained uninterrupted and the sound quality was okay. Voices came out loud enough. Clarity wasn't the best but it was okay nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer support smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise cancelation system is also pulling its own weight ensuring pretty good background noise suppression, as reported by the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker on the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua however is not as good as we hoped. We ran it through our tests numerous times and it still scored Below Average. Perhaps it's best for us to retest a retail unit once we have access to one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not a lot has changed here either. Functionality is basically the same, but now with a prettier Material design interface. Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia M4 Aqua offers a customizable on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to what Swype offers, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-hand size keyboard is available too. If enabled, it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen so it gets more comfortable for single handed text input.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album photo gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We should all be familiar with Sony's custom gallery - Album. It organizes images into groups of thumbnails and sorts them by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous versions there isn't a homepage that hosts all of your albums, instead you get the same navigation drawer as the app drawer is offering. There you can find a selector of all of your online and offline albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Filters and effects are also abundant. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. The Walkman interface is based on a hidden swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player to your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the app drawer or the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in the volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There's also an FM radio tuner with RDS. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook. The interface is very intuitive and complete with stunning animations. Possibly one of the best FM radio apps out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you would need to have your headset plugged in for the FM radio to pick up any signal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Movies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 naming convention and it won't pull info about individual episodes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E4g was able to handle videos up to 1080p resolution. It had issues with the AC-3 audio codec and failed to load sound in videos carrying it but that's mostly normal for smartphones these days. MKV movies went through, but without sound because of their AC-3 audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player comes with subtitle support by default, the only requirement is both file names (video and subtitles) to be identical.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua did very well in our audio quality test. The smartphone did a great job in the first part, where it's connected to an active external amplifier and posted very scores top to bottom. Its volume levels come up just below average, but everything else about the output is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones did harm the stereo crosstalk notably, but had no effect on the other aspects of the performance. Once more, the volume levels were nothing worth writing home about, though, so we have to deduct a couple of points and give this one a very good, rather than a perfect mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera is promising but not quite there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua boasts a 13MP camera, which is impressive, at least on paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M4 Aqua shoots with a maximum resolution of 4128 x 3096 pixels (13MP) in both Manual and Superior Auto modes if you opt for the 4:3 image aspect ratio (16:9 is default and it's a smaller size).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is aided by a LED flash for low-light photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a dedicated two-stage shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera viewfinder is the usual affair, nothing has changed on Android Lollipop. In Superior Auto mode stills and videos share it and you can snap a photo or shoot a video without changing modes beforehand. While this is convenient, framing your videos correctly is nearly impossible as they have a different field of view and you only get to see the actual framing only once you've started recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IN Manual mode you can switch between stills and video capture so that you can see the framing of your images and videos correctly (each with its own field of view) before you've pressed the shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder, which sounds more impressive than it really is. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do, however, get a dedicated video mode, with a proper viewfinder with manual control, which is nice to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode is what we've already seen in other Xperia phones. There are no settings you can change, everything here is done automagically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia M4 Aqua offers several other interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama but, it's not really all that great. Stitching is not horrible, but till clearly visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs real-life visual cues in the scene to track your motion). Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first impression from shooting with the Xperia M4 Aqua is that the camera is quite slow, meaning shot to shot time is really long. Superior Auto not always produced the type of shots we were looking for so we often resorted to shooting in Manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images themselves are a mixed bag. On one hand, you have great colors, excellent contrast and dynamic range, nice detail definition and even great pixel level processing. On the other, the edges of the images came out blurry more often than not - and for no apparent reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also as soon as it gets darker, or even when part of the scene turns out to be in the shadows, the digital noise in those regions spikes up and the noise suppression clearly squashes a lot of the fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hera are some camera samples from the 13MP camera:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Superior Auto would occasionally activate the HDR mode, if you really want to force it, you'd have to go to Manual mode abd select Backlight Correction (HDR) from the Scenes menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of HDR samples:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We uploaded the full resolution 13MP photos to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution smartphones. The image quality and contrast - are below average, which is odd, considering the 13MP camera hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is capable of capturing 1080p video. That's a little disappointing, seeing how there are plenty of megapixels and processing power for 2160p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder shares the same UI as the still camera, unless you go into manual mode. In manual mode you can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the Xperia M4 Aqua features digital image stabilization - SteadyShot, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilization systems work). Also, it takes a huge toll on the quality. The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way if the option is turned on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an HDR option, as well as various preset scenes to pick from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but those come out in 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's 1080p video samples are nothing to rave about. Sharpness and detail are pretty low and there is also quite a bit of noise. The frame rate is around 29 fps, while the bitrate is good at 16-17Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 128 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rather surprisingly, autofocus was pretty laid back unlike most other Xperia phones we have reviewed and hardly hunted for focus while video recording. It did act up a little bit in the HDR sample, but, considering what it did to overall quality and colors, we don't really consider it superb to begin with. It even had a bit of frame drop, making for a quite underwhelming experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p sample, which we've uploaded on YouTube. We also shot one in HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample (9s, 24MB) for you to download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua captures mediocre 1080p videos. It manages to resolve good detail in our resolution chart test and under good light conditions, but there is lots of noise and artefacts when shooting in low-light rooms.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M4 Aqua also features the Office Suite 8, which allows for creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and File Manager apps are available on board the device by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife app comes pre-installed too. It is a service similar to Samsung's My Magazine and HTC One's Blinkfeed. The interface is clean and simple yet beautiful, and there are lots of preloaded feeds. You can add your own RSS links too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's New app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were quite happy to see that Sony has finally retired the Sony Select App. It was begging to be deprecated for quite some time now, as What's New offers the same features and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there are no known Wi-Fi networks in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Lounge is a sort of custom-tailored deal and promotion aggregator. It gives users the opportunity to participate in various Sony promotions and win prizes. Another interesting little feature is the Movie Creator. Its name is pretty much says it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly enough, Sony has decided not to bundle either the Sony PlayStation app or PartyShare, even though they we present on the low-end Xperia E4 and E4g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and Navigation are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in GPS receiver (now complete with GLONASS support). Offline maps are available, again, since the last update, so you can save some data traffic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia M4 Aqua key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M4 Aqua is very well-made and durable. Build-quality is superb and even though compromises have been made with materials, the phone looks quite premium and resembles the flagship Xperia Z3 from design down to the very dimensions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is far from high-end with a resolution of 720 x 1280px. However, the IPS LCD is very bright and offers above-average contrast and sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery endurance is superb. At 81 hours the unit will happily get you through two days on a charge. Perhaps even more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia launcher runs quite nicely on the M4 Aqua and is packed with a lot of interesting features. The phone is definitely not lacking on the software side and it is astounding how well Sony has managed to transition to Lollipop, without compromising the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance-wise, the Xperia M4 Aqua is a solid mid-ranger. It runs great and has enough oomph to handle most everyday tasks and then some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker on the Xperia M4 Aqua scored Below Average in out rests. It is really on the quiet side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not impressive as things stand right now. 13MP might look formidable on paper, but Sony hasn't managed to make much use of the hardware. Quality and detail are poor, photos often come out with a lot of noise and underwhelming sharpness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua has a lot going for it. It looks and feels good, has solid future-proof mid-ranger specs, it comes with LTE and a dual-SIM option and is also IP68 certified. To top it all off, it is quite reasonably priced at less than ?300 (according to pre-order prices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mid-range market however is what must reel in the big money as manufacturers have really started spoiling users for choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we also take into consideration that ex-flagship devices often end up it the same price range after a year or so, it becomes clear that the Xperia M4 is entering into a really tough crowd and simply being a good device, might not be enough to impress users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, frankly, the M4 Aqua is far from perfect in a few areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact is that you don't really need to look far for a viable competitor. In fact, one is hiding in the company's own back yard. We have mentioned the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact on multiple occasions throughout this review and there is a good reason why. The smaller version of Sony's current flagship now goes for just a few bucks more, if not the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For that, you get a clearly superior Snapdragon 801 chipset, not to mention a 20.7MP camera. You do sacrifice same on looks and a little bit of screen size, but overall, we can see why the Z3 Compact is so vastly popular among Sony fans and we highly doubt that the M4 Aqua will do nearly as good in sales.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z3 Compact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't really feel the need for owning a very recent device, the highly successful Samsung Galaxy S4 I9505 can still be picked up brand new and for about as much the M4 Aqua will cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two-year-old flagship still packs some serious performance power with its Snapdragon 800. The display on the Galaxy S4, for instance, is exactly the same size at 5.0-inches, but it is better in every way. It has FullHD resolution and uses Super AMOLED technology for superior contrast and colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over at Camp HTC we can also find a few interesting alternatives to the Xperia M4 Aqua. The HTC Desire 820 is almost identical to the Xperia in terms of specs, as well as price. The choice between the two might actually boil down to whether you find the Xperia launcher or HTC Sense more convenient. Out test do, however show that the HTC has a slight edge in camera quality and it does also offer a tiny bit more than the Sony, like an 8MP front-facing camera and 16GB of onboard storage. The HTC One (M8s) might also be a viable choice, but it is kind of exotic and has only now started selling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire 820 ? HTC One M8s</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2, another aging flagship, is also, currently priced under the ?300 mark. The device offers a slightly bigger screen with FullHD resolution and a more-capable Snapdragon 800 processor. Android Lollipop is already seeding as well. So, picking up a former flagship, like the G2 is definitely not a bad choice. The LG G3 has also had its share of price cuts so it will run you some ?350, which is not so far from the M4 Aqua price. Of course, neither of those offers water-proofing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Xperia M4 Aqua is a good phone or even the best Sony mid-ranger we have seen recently. And for under ?300 (pre-order price), it's a pretty good deal as well. We definitely have to give Sony credit for what it has achieved with the M4 Aqua and even though we singled a few possible competitors, it's really hard to find a 2015 phone from a major brand that would surpass what it offers for this budget - with waterproofing definitely standing out as a key differentiating feature.</paragraph>
