			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is the new pretender to the Android smartphone throne and one that enters the fray with a bang. Well aware of the challenge ahead - and determined to make it an opportunity - the G2 comes duly armed. Four Krait 400 cores on the Snapdragon 800 chipset, a 13 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization, insanely thin bezels to a fabulous 5.2" FullHD screen are only some of the G2's highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 already made the Samsung Galaxy S4 sweat to stay in the match but now a different kind of foe is on its path. The HTC One will challenge the LG G2 with a metal-clad gapless body, BoomSound speakers and Beats Audio as well as Sense UI that moves away from Android dogmas and aims to bring your precious content right on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the face of it, the HTC One should stand little chance against the much fresher LG G2. The latter has had precious time to prepare and draw from the latest in hardware. Belonging to the same school of thought of nothing-goes-in-and-nothing-gets-out (read battery and memory cards), the HTC One offers a better choice of storage. It's still one of the hottest-looking pieces of hardware this season too, so even the creative LG G2 may have a hard time matching it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One over the LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Currently a brand new 16GB version of the LG G2 will set you back some 500 Euro, which coincidentally will also get you the base 32 gig model of the HTC One. That's something to definitely consider, along with the fact that a 32GB LG G2 will cost you 30% more than the 32GB HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 gives you the obvious advantage of having a bigger display on basically the same-size chassis. Sure, the LG flagship is slightly wider, but it's not necessarily noticeable. What's more, there's that Snapdragon 800 to consider, which is way faster than the Snapdragon 600 inside the HTC One. It handles 1080p video recording at 60fps (the HTC One offers 720p@60fps) and literally rages through the benchmarks, although, in day to day usage, you won't exactly call the HTC One slow either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing to consider is the camera. The LG G2's camera is optically stabilized, just like the One's, but offers a higher resolution sensor, which produces clearly superior quality. To make up for it, the HTC One has the cool Zoe additions, which make the camera a lot more fun than on most phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll take a closer look at the hardware of both phones a little later in this review but at first glance it's absolutely certain both manufacturers had different approaches in this department. The LG G2 is all about maximizing the screen to the point you feel like you're holding nothing but display. The HTC One brings two front-facing stereo speakers for a more immersive media-playing experience. The cold hard, precision-cut aluminum body feels nicer than the glossy and slippery plastics of the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wherever your allegiance lies, this is a battle of old and new. The HTC One hasn't got the hardware chops to compete against the more powerful, newer LG flagship. It's a more straightforward device that seeks a balance between screen and sound, pixel count and size, locked-in mentality and looks. It has a custom skin that doesn't want to be compared to Samsung's TouchWiz but instead gives you BlinkFeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 will have to work hard and take the HTC One seriously. The One has already won the hearts of many and with impeccable and standard-setting audio on top of the standard flagship-grade equipment. So, as we move on with this comparison, will be testing every facet of performance and strive for the most in-depth coverage of each and every worthwhile spec.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On paper, the two devices share much of their design ideology. Their fronts proudly flaunt 1080p screens, but to compare them as equals would be wrong as these devices strive to deliver very different experiences out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is curvier and has gotten rid of everything at the front to make room for the whopping 5.2" display. Its bezels are twice as thin as those on the HTC One, there are no buttons of any kind on the front - the screen to surface ratio is insane, really. The front is entirely covered by Gorilla Glass 2 while the rest of the device sports glossy plastic finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One goes for a very different look. Its angular and, instead of glossy plastic, goes for an aluminum unibody with two main aluminum pieces placed along a matte polycarbonate frame with small little plastic inlays on the back helping the antennas operate. The One is 1 mm shorter than the LG G2 and 3 mm narrower but squeezes in a 4.7" screen diagonal (that's full 12.7mm less). The rest is reserved for two speakers placed top and bottom of the screen. Each speaker has a separate Beats Audio amplifier, designed to deliver deep sound when you're enjoying multimedia or games on the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the LG G2 are made of plastic and feature a sloping design, leading up to the edge of the screen. They're free of controls save for the pop out microSIM card tray on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One also has a popping microSIM tray on the left side, while on the right is a single piece volume button made out of brushed aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the LG G2 lie two grilles - one for the primary microphone and one for the loudspeaker. The microUSB port is located in the middle. That's where the 3.5mm headphone jack is as well. The top of the LG G2 features the noise-reducing microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One has its microUSB port on the right, along with the main microphone. The 3.5mm headphone jack is located on the top of the device next to the power/lock button, with an IR blaster integrated therein.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the LG G2 is where all the controls are. There are two volume buttons each side of a power/lock key. You can also unlock the LG G2 by double-tapping on the screen but otherwise the centrally-placed three button combo at the rear is what you use for operating the device, aside from the outstanding screen on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the buttons lie the 13 MP camera lens and a single LED flash. The back of the LG G2 features a hyperglaze-like surface with a pattern underneath, which is a bit too reflective for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One has a much simpler back panel design. It has the Ultrapixel camera in the center, along with a single LED flash to the left of it. There's also a noise-reducing microphone in the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of the HTC One is thickest at the center and then slopes towards the edge, meaning it's notably thicker than most of its competitors, but fits nicely in your palm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, the two devices will appeal to different audiences. The HTC One is sharper, slightly narrower and feels elongated and colder compared to the LG G2. The latter has a subtler rounded body with glossy finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While every little aspect of the HTC One's design - the brushed aluminum volume rocker, engraved HTC logo at the back, loudspeaker grilles - is noticeable whilst you're holding the phone, the LG G2 prefers to keep the focus on the display and keep all the rest out of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite their differences, both devices feel extra pleasant in the hand, offering immediate reassurance that you're holding a sophisticated, premium gadget. Both devices are built with ease of use in mind and give out quality feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The HTC One is undoubtedly the better-looking of the two, but the LG G2 has impressively squeezed a far larger display and battery into a body of the same volume. The front-mounted speakers earn the One the final point of this round to level the score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The displays of the two devices are the main focus and rightfully so. On paper the LG G2 has a clear advantage with its edge-to-edge 5.2" screen that carries the elaborate True HD-IPS+ LCD nomenclature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its 1080p resolution is good for around 424 pixels per inch, which is well beyond the point where a naked human eye can differentiate individual pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One brings a Super LCD3 of 4.7" diagonal and the same 1080 x 1920 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 469 ppi. At this point, though, we'd call the difference impossible to spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what about under a microscope? Here they go. The pixel arrangement is mostly the same, being conventional RGB with the G2 pixels slightly larger than those on the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G2 and HTC One matrices under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's get technical and see what lies beneath the surface. The LG G2's screen is a tiny bit brighter, while the HTC One has a slight edge when it comes to contrast. The differences are so minor though, impossible to spot in day-to-day usage. They are probably also smaller than the unit-to-unit variance that usually occurs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to contrast under strong light, or otherwise known as our outdoor legibility test. Here the reflectiveness of the LG G2's panel pushes it some way behind the HTC One's score, although neither of the two managed to particularly impress here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the two smartphones have top of the line displays on tap. Their contrast and sharpness is evenly matched, and so is the great color rendering. The LG G2 has the size advantage, while the One does better outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. The huge difference in size is enough to dwarf the sunlight legibility advantage. Both screens are gorgeous, but the LG G2 simply has more of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next we come to the all-important battery life - something power users hold in great esteem. The LG G2 has a more demanding chipset to properly feed and a bigger screen, which should naturally draw more juice. However it also has an ampler 3000 mAh Li-Po unit to rely on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the opposite corner, the HTC One has a much humbler 2300 mAh Li-Po battery that has to carry the Snapdragon 600 and its 4.7" screen that still has the same number of pixels as the G2 unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First comes the call time test, which unsurprisingly saw the LG G2 come out on top. With the chipset idling and the screen switched off, its huge battery was made to count and the LG flagship achieved a whopping 25 hours. This made the otherwise respectable 13:38 h score of the HTC One look rather miserable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing saw the two contenders tighter together. Back when it launched, the HTC One was the longest lasting browsing device that we had seen, but the LG G2 did brilliantly to beat that achievement by almost an hour and a half.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is more of the same. The HTC One did quite well, but the LG G2 was still out of reach.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So the battery contest has proven to be a rather one-sided affair. The LG G2 absolutely demolishes the HTC One and with an endurance rating of 62 hours against the 48 hours of the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>More on the LG G2 battery test can be had here and there goes the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. Despite a very respectable performance by the HTC One, the LG G2 is the clear winner here, beating it in every single element of the test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 and HTC One are both running on Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2, and should be getting the 4.3 treatment soon enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG and HTC have different approaches to what they think Android should look like and how it should behave. While LG went for a TouchWiz-like approach, filling the software with a gigantic set of features you need constant pop up tutorials, HTC chose a different direction and tried to bring as much multimedia as close to the front as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two user interface videos, we've made, to help you get an idea of what Android feels like on the two devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG put the Lock/Unlock hardware key at the back of the G2, but even if you aren't too thrilled about it you aren't forced to use it. You can wake the phone with a double tap on its screen and then lock it back with another double tap on an empty space on your homescreen or the notification area curtain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool LG lockscreen that lets you peek beneath the lockscreen is onboard. There are five animations for the peek hole type - the familiar dewdrop, ripple, while hole, crystal and the default particle. All of them are really cool and we honestly had a hard time deciding on which effect we like best. The lockscreen now has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right is special and fires up the camera, but you can easily disable it from the widget menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen on the HTC One isn't as rich as that on the LG G2 in either looks or functionality. There's a clock, weather info and four shortcut slots. You can put a folder instead of an app shortcut if you need more than four apps accessible right from the lockscreen. Missed calls and incoming messages are duly displayed, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no way to change lockscreen shortcuts independently from the ones docked on the homescreen. Many users may find that inconvenient and it's worth pointing out that the G2 does offer that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the LG G2 you get three homescreen panes to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to add more (up to seven) or delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. You can also set any of the homescreens as default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front touch buttons are also highly customizable - you can choose their arrangement, you can even add a fourth permanent shortcut for the Quick Memo. You also set black or white background for those keys and choose if that background will be transparent on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One has quite the different homescreen, however. The leftmost pane is called BlinkFeed and looks quite a bit like Flipboard. It aggregates posts from your social networks and stories from over a thousand news sources. You can pick what topics you're interested in and BlinkFeed will automatically pull relevant content. You can also search for specific content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're not stuck with BlinkFeed if you don't like it - the rest of the homescreen panes are the standard type with shortcuts and widgets and you can set one of them to the be default one (the one you get to when you tap Home). You can't remove the BlinkFeed panel altogether, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification area on LG's Optimus UI tries to squeeze as many shortcuts as it can. The topmost tab has shortcuts to various radios and features. You are free to add and remove toggles from the edit menu. You can add an insane amount of shortcuts here, and don't have to worry about whether they'll fit on the screen - the row becomes side-scrollable so you can still access them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles are the Q Slide shortcuts - they launch pop-up widget-like versions of the video player, web browser, phone, messages, calendar, email, memo, voice recorder, file manager and calculator. In case you don't need some of those shortcuts, you can remove it via the edit key at the end of the shortcut row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's also screen brightness and volume toggles - it's really as functional as it gets here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's notification area has its roots in stock Android 4.2.2. Upon swiping down you get nothing more than a black canvas the date and time and all of your notifications - email, texts, etc. There's a shortcut in the top right, which takes you to the Quick Settings menu. The QS menu shows your contact photo and shortcuts for brightness, settings, Wi-Fi, mobile data, etc. You cannot edit these shortcuts and add new ones, sadly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can directly access the Quick Settings menu on the HTC One by performing a swipe down with two fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the LG G2 the app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reshuffle or uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to make the icons in the app drawer bigger, too. If you select an app whilst in edit mode, a pop up will let you see information like storage usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC decided upon a different app drawer with Sense 5. Instead of the usual horizontal side-swippable panes of apps you get a vertical grid of either 3x3 or 4x4 apps. At the top there's a large digital clock and weather information. The tedious thing about Sense 5's app drawer is that you cannot drag apps from it to the homescreen. You need to drag an app upward and choose shortcut, which will then send it to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall two very different approaches. While LG decided to take the Android base and augment it with its numerous Optimus UI features, HTC decided to change the basics and add its own app drawer and a new homescreen pane, which is more app than homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also not too much room for personalization with HTC Sense 5, while LG's implementation is much more flexible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. While HTC Sense 5 is very smooth and relies on cool animations and flat fonts and icons, LG G2's Optimus UI follows Android guidelines more closely and gives users more in terms of functionality. The lockscreen and notification area are particularly clear wins for the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Galleries - nearly stock versus animated<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 uses the same gallery app as the Optimus G and G Pro - in essence, a near stock Adroid gallery with a few custom touches here and there. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored on the phone. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC decided to transform the gallery on the One into your animated album, which is always alive. That is possible thanks to HTC Zoe, which is more advanced than any other gallery on a phone and it was made possible by the dedicated ImageChip 2 that the One uses. When you use the camera in Zoe mode, every time you press the shutter key, the phone captures up to 20 full res shots and a 3 second video (1 second before you press the shutter key and 2 seconds after). All that information is required for the advanced features of Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos and multiple full-res shots come into play when editing images as well. Since the phone has a video of the scene during which the photo was taken, it can find moving objects and put a red X on them so that you can tap and remove the ones you want, but keep the rest. The result is a full-resolution 4MP image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe can also make sure everyone in the photo is smiling and their eyes are open - it detects all faces and circles them, then you can swipe to go through all available images of that face until you find the perfect one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another feature is called Sequence shot. It takes a shot of a moving object and it creates a cool effect "multiple exposure" effect where that object appears several times on the photo. It's perhaps easier to show the effect than explain it, here's a shot of a BMXer jumping over a ramp. You can tweak the effect by adding and removing clones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zoe arsenal of effects doesn't stop here - there are some vanity effects too. One such effect is Face contour, which allows you to easily slim someone's face. There's also Skin smoothing, an automatic lightning fix, Eye enhancer (which makes your subject's eyes open wider), Eye brightening, Red-eye removal and Anti-shine. The strength of these effects is adjustable with a slider so you can fine tune it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video players different like night and day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G2 has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated, yet it's quite powerful. The live preview feature is back - it's a YouTube-like pop up preview of the video above the scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the basics out of the way, the available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons. There's a pop-out button at the bottom right corner too, indicating that the app is part of the QSlide functionality on the Optimus UI. LG have implemented MX Player-like controls too - a swipe left or right will move the video forward or backwards, while a swipe up or down will tweak brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new additions is a Video Speed control (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another cool feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with the familiar pinch gesture) during playback and some serious magnification is allowed, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player also supports all popular subtitles formats. You can open subtitles manually in case the subtitle file is not using the same name as the video file. Non-Latin subtitles are supported as well and there are the usual options of choosing the font, color, size, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC One has a pretty simple interface. There isn't even a dedicated app, you just pick a video from the gallery. Anyway, you get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to launch the camera and a small square with the current time and battery charge. Those automatically hide after a few seconds, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can use the Beats audio sound enhancement just like the music player, which is great for watching videos. The video player supports DLNA and you can use an MHL adaptor to plug the phone into a TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like with the LG G2 you can adjust the playback speed on the HTC One. This is helpful for clips, you've shot in one of the high frame rate modes, it allows you to watch either a High Frame Rate (it playbacks in real-time, just like The Hobbit) or in slow motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is what's important - codec support. The LG Optimus G Pro handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound. There are were no issues with higher bitrates and file sizes, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One, on the other hand, failed pretty miserably when it came to codec support . It couldn't play all our DivX videos save for one, MOV files were out of the question and did choke with some audio codecs (like AC3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the most important part - screen size. The LG G2 is a much better device for watching movies on as it offers the bigger canvas and it's an absolute joy watching high-res movies on it. However the HTC One has its edge with the front-facing speakers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music players - from features to pure bass<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG G2 has an interface that is simple, easy to use, but still full of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets and you can even create custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One comes with a custom music player, which is HTC Beats enabled, of course. It can organize your music library by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has some handy features out of the box. It can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only) and it can also search for lyrics. The lyrics can be displayed either in karaoke mode or just as text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board, you just have the option to toggle Beats audio on or off. That's not ideal, but at least the BoomSound stereo speakers on the front of the HTC One are quite loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and it has even been integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's approach to the music player is simple - it has Beats Audio and here's the album art. LG on the other hand delivers a custom tailored experience to everyone via its equalizer presets and manual mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Both devices offer the usual set of multimedia apps and both deliver them with a twist. The HTC One has a flat-out better gallery thanks to Zoe, but a cleaner music and video player. The LG G2 delivers an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink video player and a music player with equalizer, but no automagical features to match Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC set out to deliver the best loudspeaker output on a smartphone to date. And looking at the numbers the HTC One is the clear winner here. The LG G2 sounds okay on its speaker but its speaker is rather quiet and you might miss a few calls with it now and then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly, the HTC One also has far nicer sounding output with deeper bass and less distortion. The front-facing speakers are also far more comfortable for multimedia or playing games as they provide more immersive experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One. Clearly. </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output perfectly clean, but not very loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 showed nicely clean output in both parts of our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone got pretty decent scores, but was led down by its volume levels, which were only average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scores stay close to perfect even when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk worsens a bit but the rest of the readings are virtually unaffected (frequency response actually improves a bit). Unfortunately, the volume levels remained just as uninspiring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beats-powered HTC One offer arguably the best audio quality in the smartphone world right now. It did great in the active external amplifier part of the test, posting great scores all over the field. In addition it had volume levels far higher than its competitor here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, there's next to no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises a tiny bit, but that's the only affected reading. Volume levels remain at the same high level, too. This is the second smartphone in a row where HTC makes the Beats audio logo stand for something other than a simple equalizer, but as we said last time, the wait was probably worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2 and HTC One frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One. Another one that doesn't need much explanation - the One has the cleaner and louder output.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking at the chipsets of the two contenders it's rather obvious who the favorite here is. Optimizations and tweaks are one thing, but will hardly make up for the one generation older chipset inside the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 packs a Snapdragon 800 chip with four 2.26 GHz Krait 400 cores and the potent Adreno 330 GPU to handle intense graphics. On the opposite side sits the Snapdragon 600-powered HTC One with four 1.7 GHz Krait 300 cores and the Adreno 320 GPU. Both devices carry 2 gigs of RAM to boost multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapdragon 800 is a more complex, powerful chipset in every feasible way compared to Snapdragon 600 and brings a new tweaked CPU core in addition to the far higher clockspeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi gives the CPU individual cores a test, while Linpack tests the multi-threaded output. The LG G2 went off to a flying start, trashing the HTC One in both tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 2 is a cross-platform benchmark and focuses on CPU and memory speeds. The LG G2 came out on top once again, although things were far closer this time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 4 and Quadrant are a couple of all-round benchmarks. The LG G2 recorded two more wins here with the second one being the most emphatic so far .</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on to graphics benchmarks. Here the Adreno 330 has a clear edge over the Adreno 320 and the results are hardly surprising. Although the HTC One produced good results on all three , the LG G2 was far beyond its reach each time.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's clear as day that the hardware inside the LG G2 is far superior to that of the HTC One. The HTC flagship doesn't feel slow in any use case and it provides great app loading times and browsing through the phone won't make you feel in dire need of a Snapdragon 800-powered smartphone. However, if you use the two one after the other, you will immediately realize which one you want to keep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. The HTC One is a snappy smartphone, but it's no match for the LG G2 and the Snapdragon 800 beast inside it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main camera on the LG G2 has an F/2.4 lens and a 13MP sensor that captures photos with a maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 and 1080p videos at 60fps . There's also optical image stabilization and a 2.1MP front-facing camera that too shoots 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other side of the ring is the HTC One with a 1/3" stabilized sensor with a 16:9 aspect ratio that's mounted behind a 5-element lens with F/2.0 aperture. The sensor takes photos with 2688 x 1520 pixel resolution, but switching to the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio limits the maximum resolution to 2048 x 1520 pixels, or just over 3MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that HTC has gone for a far lower resolution means that the actual pixels are far larger than those on the LG G2 conventional sensor. In HTC marketing talk these larger pixels are called UltraPixels. In theory having fewer, larger pixels limits the performance in good light, but should benefit low-light shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 camera interface features a bar on the right with the still/video toggle, a virtual shutter key and gallery shortcut on the right and a column with four shortcuts on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick between one of twelve shooting modes - Normal, Shot and Clear (erases something from a picture), HDR, Panorama, VR Panorama (Photo Sphere shot), Beauty shot, Dual camera shot, Night scene, Sports, Time Catch shot and Intelligent Auto mode, which automatically selects the right scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Time catch shot feature (also called Time machine camera) snaps a photo, but also records several photos of what happened before you hit the shutter key. You can save any of the photos on that list that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One's camera interface is pretty simple - there are two shutter keys (one for stills and one for video), above them is the gallery shortcut and below is the effects button. On the left side of the screen you get flash mode selector and the Zoe toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you enable Zoe (an indicator at the bottom of the screen confirms you're in Zoe mode) and tap the still shutter key. The key turns into a progress bar, counting down the three seconds during which the phone records video, reminding you to stay relatively still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One. The number of features offered by the LG G2 camera is undoubtedly higher, but the fact that Zoe works without requiring any effort on your part wins this round for the HTC flagship. Those who like to fiddle with settings, scenes and modes will appreciate the G2 camera UI better, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we take a look at the quality these two devices output let's take a look at the field of view. That's how much the phone's camera lens can fit into the frame and in the case of the LG G2 and HTC One is slightly different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One features a wider-angle lens, allowing you to fit more without walking back, but also meaning that each object is described by fewer pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're dealing with a 13 MP and 4 MP units here so in order to compare them more easily we've done some resizing. In the first test scenario the HTC One samples were upsized to meet the LG G2 in its native 13 MP resolution, while in the second part the LG G2 goes down to 4 MP to tumble with the One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also supplied all the full resolution samples below the crops so you can compare the two devices as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upscaling is the proper way to compare resolved detail in shots captured at different resolution. As it turns out the different pixel count is more than marketing talk in this case as the LG G2 comes out the clear winner here - objects are nicely detailed and shadows aren't as noise-heavy as those on the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also noticeable purple fringing on the HTC One's images whereas the LG G2 shots are free of such defects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we look at the downscaled images (when the LG G2 loses some detail but also some noise) things look better for the HTC One, but it's still unable to match the detail level of the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a bunch of HDR samples with both devices. The HTC One does good job of bringing extra detail in both the shadows and the highlights, but the LG G2's HDR samples are pretty great too. The G2 squeezes a bit of extra detail in the shadows, but the One Again the G2 carries more detail in both modes and at least attempts to produce a bluer sky in its images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to low light photography. The LG G2 and HTC One both have the advantage of optical image stabilization, which reduces shaking and, in theory, allows for slower shutter speed and lower ISO settings. In theory, the HTC One's larger pixels should give it a slight advantage here as they should capture more light. The HTC One also has an F/2.0 aperture compared to the F/2.4 on the LG G2, which adds to its light capturing advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a couple of samples in a dim-lit room with both phones at Normal and Night modes (without the flash) and in Normal mode with flash enabled and compiled the best and worst samples so you can know what to expect in those scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2's Night mode is hardly of much use as in low light conditions the camera software detects the light is insufficient and mimics Night mode even when set to Normal. This means that selecting Night explicitly makes next to no sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One produces pretty noisy images in low light without the flash. The software is obviously hard at work with noise suppressing but the final result is not only noisier but also less detailed than the G2 output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Normal mode the LG G2 tends to select slower speeds than the HTC One, which means that its shots run a higher risk of ending up blurry. It appears, though, that the G2 image stabilization partially makes up for that as our samples are similarly shaky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash photography also goes in the LG G2's favor - its single LED is slightly more powerful than that of the HTC One. However in close range scenes such as the one below this leads to over exposure and loss of detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've compiled the three low light samples of each smartphone below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the LG G2 full resolution samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the HTC One's full-res samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also compiled the HDR samples of the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And those of the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to Panorama shots the LG G2 can go both ways - portrait and landscape. However oddly the LG G2 resolution is rather limited, producing panoramas of around 6 MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One can only record panoramas in landscape mode and lets you stitch more shots together. Its panoramas tips in at around 8 MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. The higher pixel count lets the G2 easily take the good light round and the two are quite evenly matched when the lights go off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking at video recording it's easy to deem the LG G2 as the superior device purely by its specs sheet. The device not only offers FullHD video capture at 30 frames per second, but can also do 60 fps. The HTC One can output 1080p@30fps and does 60 fps video at a maximum 1280 x 720 resolution. However the HTC One can capture HDR video at 1080p, while the LG G2 doesn't offer HDR video capture at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Optical image stabilization brings, perhaps, the biggest advantage in video capture as there's much less camera shake going on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One's Ultrapixel camera has a huge field of view advantage over the LG G2. As you can see below the HTC flagship can fit much more inside the frame than the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So FoV aside how do the two camcorders compare. Well looking at the samples below, at 100% zoom the HTC One has the clear edge in exposure as the the LG G2 has been a bit too enthusiastic with its metering, resulting in blown out highlights. The colors on the One are also more accurate, while the G2 goes for a bit too much saturation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for detail the LG G2 has a slight edge, although it's not very significant. The G2 was faster to focus, continuously, than the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To test the OIS of both devices, we've made a side by side comparison. Looking at the video we can say that both OIS implementations do a good job with major shaking, while the HTC One handles small shakes a pinch better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've made both videos available for direct watching below. Here goes and the LG G2's sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the HTC One's sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shooting in 60 fps makes the whole environment you're filming appear smoother and faster. The HTC One does a fine job with its 720@ 60 fps videos although it lacks the resolution to compete with the G2's 1080p@60fps. You can find a 1080p@60fps sample from the LG G2 and a 720p@60fps sample from the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. The HTC One does have a slight advantage in terms of image quality when comparing 1080p@30fps clips, but lacks high framerate recording at the highest resolution, which makes quiet a lot of difference.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's more than one way to say which one of the two beastly smartphones we reviewed today is better, but that won't necessarily mean it's the phone you'll want. Adding the wins and ties together in our test looks like the objective, fact-based approach. OK, we take this for a fact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's another one. The LG G2 is the newer device and that carries a lot of weight in an industry evolving as rapidly as this. But then again, it's more expensive too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want the better camera, faster processing, larger screen and beefier battery, the LG G2 is the clear choice. It's also the choice if you're all into the software that has the best possible punch right out of the box - because, honestly, LG has done a fine job there. Not to mention, the courage to take risks with the design - which we think worked out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One shines with its impeccable audio quality, front-mounted stereo speakers and gapless precision-cut aluminum unibody. It just oozes quality and feels special in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the One isn't all looks and no game. It's by no means slow, regardless of being powered by an older-gen chipset. Apps run smooth and fast, the UI is just as bouncy and responsive, and heavy duty tasks won't affect the RAM worse than on the LG G2. The faster processing matters in browsing, imaging and gaming but the difference most often hinges on the millisecond, and many times that's not something to fuss over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC and LG both have been through tough times, and had the slimmest margin of error imaginable with their flagships. The One and the G2 are phones any manufacturer would be proud of, and many users will love. That's the thing really, these two are some easy gadgets to fall in love with. And so hard to pick between.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, your choice is hopefully at least a bit easier after our comparison. It might actually help to weigh the facts up before putting the cash down. On the other hand, some might as well not let the facts get in the way of their emotions. And there's actually nothing wrong with that.</paragraph>
