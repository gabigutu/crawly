			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 820 and Lumia 920 give Nokia all the presence they need in the higher WP8 circles, but a smart maneuver has helped HTC emerge as a serious threat in the lower midrange. The Finns, who are obviously having none of that, responded swiftly to the Windows Phone 8S. After all, when the future of the whole company is resting on a single platform, you just can't leave anything to chance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 has obviously done its homework. Just like the HTC WP 8S, it offers a downclocked dual-core Krait CPU, 512MB of RAM and a styling that's clearly targeting youths. This kind of approach makes a lot of sense - the WP8 definitely needs an awareness boost among younger users and reasonable spenders, if it's going to seriously challenge the dominating smartphone platforms.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 620 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Specs-wise the Nokia Lumia 620 is virtually identical to the HTC Windows Phone 8S. The two major differences are a smaller screen (just 0.2 inches, at the same resolution) and the 4GB of extra storage the Nokia offers. Make no mistake though - the superior brand recognition, and more importantly, the exclusive software make the Lumia 620 the favorite in this fight. Free lifetime voice guided navigation is not a bad thing to have and can make all the difference when two devices are as closely matched as this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the HTC 8S has a two-month head start and a seemingly superior build. Looks are important and HTC are always tough opposition when it comes to design and build. So, has the Lumia 620 got what it takes to be the WP8 smartphone to have in the early 2013? And can it mount a serious challenge to the bunch of dual-core droids that pretty much own the mid-range market? We hope to find out the answers when we are done with the preview, so let's get started.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the Lumia 620's target audience, Nokia could've done a lot worse. There's enough color and gloss to get this handset noticed and, although some may scoff at the Asha-grade plastic, the Lumia 620 is not without character. The four flashier paint jobs are a bit too teeny perhaps, but the black and white combo will hopefully appeal to serious users and more conservative tastes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back actually uses a two-layer finish, similar to the Galaxy S III's hyperglaze back. There's a transparent layer on top of the base, which is painted in one of the six colors the Lumia 620 is available in. Our green unit has a yellow accent at the front - a very thin inner frame, which the handset could've easily done without.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy plastic doesn't feel as nice to the touch as, say the matte black version of the Lumia 920, but looks durable and should last a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not particularly excited about the 11mm profile of the Nokia Lumia 620, which makes the smartphone feel a bit chubby perhaps, but it's not too bad. The ample space below the capacitive keys at the front could also have been put to better use. As for the 127g of weight, we think Nokia found a good balance between portability and solid feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the Nokia Lumia 620 design and build feel more than adequate for its price range, though if we had to go by looks alone, we'd go for the HTC Windows Phone 8S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 packs a 3.8" ClearBlack LCD (that's first gen) of WVGA resolution (800 x 480 pixels). 246ppi provide excellent sharpness and the image quality turned out surprisingly good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness levels are fine, and make up for the blacks that are only average so the overall contrast is excellent for the class. Colors are generally very punchy and viewing angles are quite decent too. There's a lot of color shifting as you tilt the phone, but what's on the screen remains legible until you reach absolute extremes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you will find a discreet earpiece, the ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the three touch-sensitive buttons for getting around the Windows Phone 8 UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is absolutely nothing on the phone's left side but things are a lot busier on the right. The volume rocker is there, along with the power/lock key and a dedicated camera button. The power key is a bit too stiff for our taste, but the camera button is pretty comfortable, offering easily distinct half-press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and a microphone pinhole are the two things of interest on the Nokia Lumia 620 top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom of the phone, we find the microUSB port and the primary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is where the 5MP camera lens and the LED flash can be found. The loudspeaker grille is also here - in the bottom right corner of the Lumia 620.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The easiest way to open the Nokia Lumia 620 battery cover is to push against the camera part, while at the same time holding the edges of the phone. You will need to clean the lens afterwards, but it's a lot easier than removing the cover by only pushing up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the cover we found a 1300 mAh battery, which is the smallest we have seen in a smartphone recently. There seems to be little reason to worry though - Nokia says the battery can last for 9 h 50 min of 3G talk time or 14 h 40 min of 2G talk time or 330 h of stand-by. We'll have to get a retail unit and run our usual set of tests to believe that though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also under the hood, letting you expand the 8GB of inbuilt storage on the Lumia 620 by up to 64GB. microSD cards are going for pennies these days, so you won't need to pay the premium manufacturers charge for smartphones with more internal storage out of the box either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's interesting to note, that while it does use a micro-SIM card, the Lumia 620 SIM slot can be operated without special tools, which makes replacing the card so much easier. It is still located under the battery though, so you'd need to turn off your phone beforehand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 is comfortable to hold and single-handed operation is quite easy. As we said, it could have been slimmer, but having all the controls on one side and a small display certainly helps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset's curved sides allow it to fit perfectly in your hand. The glossy finish doesn't exactly do wonders for the grip, but the Lumia 620 won't easily slip off your hand either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved user interface with Nokia customizations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's partnership with Microsoft has been around for a while now, and the Lumia Windows Phone 8 headsets are the latest iteration of that partnership. With all its eggs in the Windows Phone basket, so to speak, Nokia aims to deliver a better Windows Phone experience than other manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 620 is the second WP8 device we've run into that features 512 MB of RAM, and like the HTC Windows Phone 8S, it's adequately able to handle most things you throw at it in what might otherwise be considered a low memory footprint. In fact, the Lumia features largely an identical specs sheet to its HTC brethren, that most advantages it will have over the 8S will be based on a superior WP8 experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen features the same customizations and we're used to from the new WP8 Lumia line. It displays missed events and messages, music controls, and various Live Apps which let apps display various notifications and images. The background image can be rotated via the Bing lockscreen, and you can also let your album art become the lockscreen image whenever you're playing music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI features the same vertical grid of Live tiles that can be reordered whichever way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more. In Windows Phone 8, they're also resizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also iOS-like multitasking available, where suspended apps can be taken over by the OS, or run in the background as needed by the application. To access the multi-tasking interface, simple hold down the back button, but there is no option to "kill" an app. You have to select it an hit the back button to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Siri and Google Now-like voice assistant called Microsofot TellMe, where you can dictate various commands and have the 620 carry them out. TellMe is access by holding down the Windows key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos with SkyDrive integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is the place where you can browse through the photos taken with the Lumia 620. The idea of a hub is that it is a central place where apps can integrate and add functionality. For example, photo effects provided by a particular app can be accessed from here, if that functionality has been enabled by the app developer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Mix Radio and Music + Videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing its own music service called Mix Radio ahead of the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms. It even has an equalizer with Dolby enhancements.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera with many features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera interface remains what we're used to from the new WP8 UI, with the inclusion of a few extras from Nokia. You have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, front/back camera toggle, flash mode setting and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses is an interesting feature, enhancing the camera functionality without making a mess of third party apps each with its own UI. Lenses are accessible directly from the native camera app (they show up in the list of installed apps too if you want to pin a Lens to the start screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Smart Shoot lens, which uses Scalado technology to remove unwanted elements from your photos. It snaps several photos, and then lets you pick different facial expressions if you're shooting a group of people, or even erase someone if they happen to walk through your shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's too early to be passing final verdicts on the Lumia 620 image quality, but given the kind of bad weather we've been having around the office recently, it did pretty well. We'll be able to share more when we get to spend more time with the smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is great for mobile browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Internet Explorer in Widows Phone 8 brings a great overall package to the table, with amazingly fast performance for such a low RAM device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the beginning, we likened the Lumia 620 with the Windows Phone 8S from HTC, as both devices feature the same amount of RAM, the same dual-core Krait processor, and even the same WVGA screen. As such, we were pleasantly surprised to see some great browser performance figures out of the Luma 620 - markedly better than those of the 8S, and in fact scoring closer to some of the more powerful Lumia devices.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Drive, other location-based apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the highlights of the Windows Phone Lumia series is the inclusion of Nokia's powerful Maps and Drive applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Drive offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has an exclusive app to help you find things near you too - it's called City Lens and it's an augmented reality app. Basically, it launches the camera and overlays various icons representing the nearby POI (along with distance and star rating), moving as you pan the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to a traditional list too - you just hold the phone upright and it will switch automatically (it's triggered by the accelerometer). Or if you hold the phone perpendicular to the ground, it will switch to map view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a place will fire up Nokia Maps so you can have a look at the extensive info it offers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We really like what we've seen from the Nokia Lumia 620 so far. The smartphone is decently quick, has a nice youthful styling and arguably gives the best bang for your buck in the Microsoft camp. It's more than certain that the flashy paint jobs will resonate with a younger demographic, but it's exactly the target audience Nokia and Microsoft would want to get on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, if Nokia gave the Lumia 620 a slightly more serious styling, it would have probably killed the HTC 8S. Instead, the Finns made it possible for the two smartphones to co-exist, thus giving the platform as a whole a better shot at growth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only aspect of the Lumia 620's performance about which we still need to be convinced is battery life. The tiny battery has good ratings on paper, but only after properly testing a retail unit will we know if it's any good in real life. It looks like Nokia will be selling the Lumia 620 as the phone to be seen with. But reasonably fast performance, proper battery backup and a solid software package may as well make it the affordable WP8 smartphone to own.</paragraph>
