			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve come to take Nokia for granted in the low end or the business class but it seems it has lost the knack for killer phones, run out of royal blood. It?s up to the Nseries to fix it all up. The Nokia N8 may just turn out to be the right cure. With that kind of hardware, it?s a smartphone you?d be mad to ignore. For a change we are not talking netbook-grade processing power or loads of RAM. Nokia have instead given their flagship an industry-leading camera and stuff like HDMI port and USB-On-the-Go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Finnish engineers often like to make a point about Symbian being the most resource-effective OS. We?ve seen it run reasonably fast indeed on even slower CPUs. This time though it?s Symbian ^3, so we?ll have to see it again to believe it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s certainly a lot of pressure on the Nokia N8. People are probably expecting more from it than the very guys who designed it. But the N8 was never meant to compete with the iPhone 4 or the Galaxy S. At least, that?s what Nokia will gladly have you believe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, with the Nokia N8 it?s not about who the competition is. Not about the business benefits of a smartphone, not about the available apps. It?s about the best camera in the business. Now, we?ll have to see about that. Again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 already managed to put a dedicated digicam to shame in our recent blind test. But it will take more than that to get the thumbs up at the end of a full review. The camera is certainly impressive but it?s the overall balance and bang-for-buck that count most in our books here so the N8 better have more aces up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We updated the phone to Symbian Anna - check out our impressions on Page 10. We installed the camera update too, our analysis and new video samples on Page 11.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 08.02.2012: The Belle update arrived and we tested that too. Check out a hands-on video and our impressions on Page 12.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We pop the box open after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well wired box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 comes in a rich retail package to give you everything you need to use all the phone features. In addition to the mandatory charger, manual and data cable (which by the way can also be used for charging) you get an extra couple of short cables.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one plugs in the microUSB port and ends on a female USB jack. As you know, the Nokia N8 supports USB-on-the-go, allowing flash sticks and supposedly even other phones? memories to be accessed from the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other cable is a male miniHDMI to female standard HDMI adapter, so you can use a regular cable for connecting your N8 to your HDTV set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last items inside the box are the one-piece headset and some leaflets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N8 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 does seem big for the size of its screen. But it?s by no means a huge slab that pushes the limits of comfortable handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A stocky touchscreen bar, it doesn?t have the flair and sex appeal of an iPhone but makes up for it with a full-metal chassis and premium build ? not to mention all those unusual colors it?s available in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do appreciate the solid feel and the hefty 135 grams of weight too. The N8 is neither slim nor lightweight, and has the sophistication of a monster truck. But it?s in no mood to fool around anyway ? a sturdy and reliable set, an impressive tool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sleek aluminum on the sides and the back and a large AMOLED touchscreen up front ? there?s nothing to dislike about the N8. If you have a thing for phones made of metal you will absolutely love it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the time of our review we managed to obtain four of the five color options of anodized scratch-proof paint available (we?re only the blue one short of a grand slam).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can?t force ourselves of course to call them all equally attractive. The Dark Grey and Silver are definitely our favorites but we?re sure that the Green and especially the Orange will find their fans too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were obviously enough users who liked them. Each got more than 10 percent approval in the Nokia Conversations recent poll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Nokia N8 is mostly taken by the 3.5? AMOLED display of nHD resolution. Tapered sides and sloping top and bottom make the handset quite comfortable to handle, both portrait and landscape. Unfortunately, the bezel around the screen is a bit too wide for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, 3.5? is a good enough size for a contemporary touch phone. And this one has several firsts to Nokia?s credit. The Finns debuted capacitive touchscreen tech on the X6 but only now is Nokia introducing multi-touch support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another first is a Nokia AMOLED display to remain perfectly legible under direct sunlight. Previous attempts were pretty poor on a bright sunny day, but this time they got it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The indoor image quality, as is to be expected from an AMOLED unit, is pretty good with deep blacks and nicely saturated colors. Not as impressive as Samsung?s SuperAMOLED screens, but certainly competitive elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 has standard screen resolution. At 360 x 640, the Nokia N8 has 44 percent less pixels than the best Android displays (854 x 480 pixels) and just over a third of the iPhone 4 pixel count (960 x 640 pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not everyone needs that kind of pixel density though, and some users probably won?t even be able to notice the difference. We do, that's for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 screen sensitivity is as good as we?ve come to expect from capacitive units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vibration feedback does deserve a mention however as it seems impressively well tweaked and does improve the user experience in a surprisingly nice way. Haptics are enabled even when you scroll lists and the icons bump against the end of the screen or when you zoom in on a video using the virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we notice the video-call camera in the upper right corner above the display. Near it are the ambient light and the proximity sensors, as well as the centrally placed earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the microphone pinhole and the menu key. There are no hardware call keys as on previous Nokia smartphones and we found that a bit confusing. Nothing you won?t get used to though. We do believe though, a hardware back button would have immensely improved usability. The software one is by far not as comfortable, being in a different place at different parts of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Nokia N8 is the power key, which also handles screen lock and the ringing profiles. The HDMI port and the 3.5mm audio jack are also there. The HDMI port is hidden under a small plastic lid to keep out dust and moisture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important thing to note here is that the Nokia N8?s HDMI port supports 720p TV-out. With DivX and XviD support right out of the box, the N8 might just replace your home media player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 left-hand side packs a couple of slots (this is where the microSD and SIM cards go) and the exposed microUSB port. USB charging works fine so you don?t have to carry a charger with you all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Nokia N8 features nothing but the Nokia proprietary charger plug. The N8 is well covered in terms of charging options. You can you use either the regular charger or any microUSB charger/data cable you might have at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side, the N8 has the volume rocker, the screen lock slider and the dedicated camera key. The first two are very comfortable, with great grip and tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key on the other hand is probably a bit too stiff and requires extra effort for a full press. This might result in some camera shake blurring when shooting at a lower shutter speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 12 megapixel camera lens is what draws all the attention round back. It doesn?t have a protective cover as that would have added quite a few millimeters more of extra girth. Instead it relies on reinforced glass front lens that Nokia claims is sturdy enough to resist all the abuse the device might get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other things of interest here are the xenon flash and the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 is powered by a 1200 mAh LI-Ion BL-4D battery that?s quoted at up to 400 hours of stand-by or up to 12 and a half hours of talk time. In real life we managed to squeeze just about two days of moderately heavy use out of the handset. You can find the Nokia N8 full battery test in our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are impressed with the Nokia N8 ? for both looks and build quality. The handset is build to last and Nokia has demonstrated the sturdiness of the aluminum shell on several occasions. The N8 is neither impressively slim, nor delicately crafted. Just the opposite actually ? it?s a solid tool, a little rough perhaps, but sturdy and reliable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only things to note are the lack of a hardware Back key and the non user-removable battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian^3 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 is the pioneer of the new Symbian^3 OS, which according to Nokia should be the first step in the company?s fightback against Android and iOS. We wish it could somehow magically leapfrog the two currently leading platforms but those things just don?t happen overnight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We updated the phone to Symbian Anna - check out our impressions on Page 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course they might have gone for a total overhaul by starting from scratch as Microsoft did but that would mean losing a lot of functionality and that?s probably the reason Nokia went for the evolutionary, rather than the revolutionary way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new OS is certainly not up with the best just yet but is certainly a step in the right direction. The Finnish software engineers finally realized that it?s a streamlined interface that people want and got rid of the whole tap-to-select-another-tap-to-activate non-sense approach that made Symbian^1 so inconsistent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some traces of that illogical interface in the camera interface, but we are hoping those will be gone soon too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video demo of the user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new OS also brings some nice UI layout and functionality changes. The homescreen is the most evident of those, its size now expanded to three panes worth of space. You are then free to fill them up with widgets and then rearrange them as you see fit. If three panels are too much for you, you can also delete some of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might notice that the homescreen starts scrolling only after you have completed your swipe across the screen but that?s how it was designed and not some lag. Because of the fact that some widgets are side-scrollable the handset waits to see if you want to browse them or skip to the next screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still if you want to see immediate response you can scroll through them by clicking the three dot symbol at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is unchanged, retaining the folders format. This comes in contrast to Android, and mostly iOS, where you get a flat menu structure with all icons located on side-scrollable panes. Now you are free to rearrange icons as you see fit so you might go for placing them all in the main folder and get a flat-ish menu system from Symbian^3 too. A list view mode is also available but that involves much more scrolling and that?s why we preferred to leave things in grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager has also been changed and now shows screenshots of the running apps, instead of just icons. You also need only a single click to kill them this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the Symbian has also been taken up a notch with the ^3 version. The Nokia N8 feels snappy most of the time, with lags noticeable only when dealing with heavy apps or when there are a lot of apps running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even though heavy multi-taskers will frown at the 256MB of RAM we didn?t get any ?Out of memory? errors even when playing the rather demanding NFS Shift game with the camera and the web browser with two tabs open running in background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the poor text input solution of Symbian^1 has been left unchanged by Symbian^3 and that?s probably our biggest grudge against the new OS (along with the web browser but we?ll come to that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are talking about the virtual QWERTY, which takes you to a new screen to do your text input and gets you back when you?re done typing. That adds an extra step each time you need to do some typing. Not quite the simplicity we all want, is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have point out that Symbian^3 has introduced quite some eye-candy as opposed to its predecessors. There are icons bumping and revolving, menus being opened with a zoom in and out effects and the occasional fading in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s again not quite up with the best, but considering that after some time too much effects become a nuisance we won?t be taking too many points away here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So generally Symbian^3 is to Android and iOS what the N8 is to their best representatives ? a step closer but not quite there. Once again though, considering the pricing we would call it adequate and certainly not a deal breaker.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A solid phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 comes with a fully functional phonebook, which can easily be synced with your exchange account. Symbian has been offering users virtually unlimited phonebook capacity and excellent contact management for quite some time. Now it is starting to add some social network integration too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting some of your contacts as favorites moves them to the top of the displayed list. This saves you quite a lot of scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign personal ringtones and videos to individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice touch when editing a contact details is the option to enter their address by picking it on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social network integration includes Facebook and Twitter, which should be fine for the vast majority of users. However you will need to go through an extra step to check out your contact?s status and then another one to see their profile. We agree it might have created a mess if that was all added to the already lengthy phonebook profile but one of those extra steps is probably a bit too much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: smart dial and everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Nokia N8. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available on the N8 and gets activated by pressing and holding the call key on the home screen. It is fully speaker-independent and as far as we can tell performs greatly, recognizing all the names we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In noisier environments though, its effectiveness might suffer. Also bear in mind that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the system will dial either the default number or the first in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is also here, practical as ever. You just punch in a few letters from the desired contact?s name and select it from the list that comes up to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final option for starting a call is by using one of the widgets available for your homescreen. It allows you to insert your favorite contacts and enter their profiles without going through the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mute an incoming call by simply flipping the phone over. That same trick also works for snoozing your alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically when you pick up the phone up to your cheek during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After we saw how solidly the N8 did in the telephony department, we also put it through its paces in our traditional loudspeaker test. The handset did quite well there too, snatching a Very good mark meaning it should be loud enough for every situation. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging department is well covered, save for the keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 can easily cater for all your messaging needs, but chances are you will find the virtual keyboard rather annoying. It?s not so much the QWERTY keyboard per se as it?s large and comfortable but the fact that it opens in a separate screen with a dedicated text box. Plus there?s no multi-touch support here so very fast typing is bound to lead to more errors than usually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We updated the phone to Symbian Anna - check out our impressions of the new keyboard on Page 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And these nuisances are not reserved for the messaging department ? it?s the way the keyboards function throughout the whole UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the essence of messaging, your short messages all arrive in a common inbox. If you like, you can also get them sorted in a threaded manner as conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 relies on a message editor that is common for all the types of messages. Stuff like a character counter in SMS go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you insert some multimedia content the message is automatically transformed into an MMS. If you type an email address as a recipient, the message turns into an email. In both cases the character counter turns into a data counter showing kilobytes instead of characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 email client allowed us to setup our Gmail account quite easily, while getting it to sync with an Exchange ActiveSync server took a couple of tries. Still in most cases all you will need is to enter is your username and password and you will be good to go in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be sorted by various criteria such as date, sender, subject, priority or even by attachments, searching is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. This can save you some data traffic charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically everything you would normally need on a mobile device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike some competing platforms Symbian handsets have always enjoyed a proper file manager. The File manager on board the N8 is a solid app that can basically do anything you can think of with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for a specific file or directory. All you need to remember is a part of the desired name and where it was located (phone memory or memory card), the Nokia N8 will find it in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Nokia N8 and its USB on-the-go support you can also use the file manger to access USB flash drives and even other phones connected over the supplied cable. The N8 successfully handled all the USB flash drives we threw at it but for one, while the handsets that weren?t created by Nokia generally refused to share their memory with the N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested an Android handset, an iPhone and even a Bada device and they all started charging but wouldn?t connect in mass storage mode. When we plugged the other end of the USB cable in a Nokia E71 though, its memory card immediately popped up in the N8 file manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is uninspiring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian^3 might have improved a lot of things about the UI but the gallery has not been on the upgrade list. The Nokia N8 comes with virtually the same image browsing software as its predecessors and honestly, it only qualifies as passable by modern standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, sweep gestures have been available for a while now and you are also getting pinch-zooming now with the N8 so it?s not all bad but some eye-candy would have been more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also we miss kinetic scrolling and panning, which will cost the N8 a few more points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the familiar pinch gesture you can also zoom in by double taping, the volume rocker or even the on-screen slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selection of multiple photos for deleting or sharing is available straight from the gallery. Unfortunately sharing is only available through MMS, email or Bluetooth with no image sharing service integration. We guess that can easily by installing the necessary uploading profiles for the services you?re interested in. At least that?s how it works on non-touch Symbian smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final features of the image gallery include the image tagging system for easier image sorting, the slide show and the albums system (again helping you sort your image database).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is relatively fast even with 12 MP pics, but zooming is somewhat slow. You need to wait for a second or two every time you start zooming in on a photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player got new album art<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian never had trouble with the music player functionality but its looks were not quite impressive. With Symbian^3 however Nokia introduces a new Cover Flow-like interface, which adds the much needed eye-candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s automatic sorting by artist, album, genre and the option to create custom playlists straight from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the huge number of supported formats, available equalizer presets and effects the picture is complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case you can control it through the music player widget on the homescreen, which also indicates the currently running track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N8's multimedia prowess wouldn't be complete without high quality audio output. Fortunately, the handset managed to deliver on that one too, achieving some excellent scores in our traditional test. And the thing is pretty loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When attached to an active external amplifier (i.e. your car stereo or your home audio system) the Nokia N8 performs greatly with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There wasn't much quality deterioration when we plugged in headphones either. Sure, the stereo crosstalk got a bit worse and we recorded some intermodulation distortion but those are rather hard to detect in anything but lab conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N8 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player, but no subtitles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video playback on Symbian smartphones, the Nokia N8 turns a new page. It?s the first handset since the Omnia HD to come with DivX and XviD support out of the box but it doesn?t stop here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playback was silky smooth on all files with a resolution up to and including 720p, which is quite impressive. Combined with the HDMI port this can easily turn the Nokia N8 into a portable big-screen video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The media player app itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode but, since anything else would have made the widescreen display useless, this is understandable. When in fullscreen, a press on the screen shows the controls, which are normally hidden. The amply sized high-contrast screen is also more than welcome for truly enjoying your clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some restrictions do apply, though. For one the handset cannot play any file that is larger than 2GB and you cannot fast forward and rewind ones larger than 1.5GB. If you manage to keep your files below that limit (which basically excludes full-length 720p HD movies) you will be fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other problem with the video player is the lack of any kind of subtitles support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally the Nokia N8 does impressively on the video playback front but it?s certainly not perfect. Nokia should be able to easily fix all those little shortcomings in some future software updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia N8 has the same neat and simple interface as on its Symbian^1 predecessors. You can search through the already preset or new stations with sweep gestures or you can use the virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel, the N8 should be able to take care of auto-switching to the frequencies of your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RDS is the best part of N8 radio app. The radio station name gets displayed with cool effects across the whole screen, while the rest of the RDS readings are printed in nicely legible text on a line at the bottom.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There?s an FM transmitter here, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N8 is among the few phones to come with a built-in FM transmitter. This cool feature allows you to stream the music on your phone to any standard FM radio receiver nearby at a frequency of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do is find an unoccupied frequency slot within the standard FM scale between 88.10MHz and 107.90MHz. Finding a position without radio interferences is harder in some places than in other (big cities have quite some radio pollution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But whatever the case with the available frequencies, the FM transmitter app is simple enough to guarantee smooth and easy operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should also keep the phone and the receiver within close distance or the signal quality quickly deteriorates. In our test we couldn?t afford moving any further than 2 meters away from the receiver but your mileage might vary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>12 megapixel monster of a camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've now come to the one of the most important parts of the review. The 12 megapixel snapper at the back of the Nokia N8 is one of the main reasons for it to be the most popular handset in our database for the past few months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed the latest Nokia N8 camera update - check out our impressions of the new UI on Page 11.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia created a lot of hype about the great shots the N8 produces but it also did their homework and packed the device with the largest sensor a mobile phone has seen (stretching to 1/1.83" inches). The larger sensor surface should benefit its low-light capabilities and dynamic range greatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it doesn't end there - the Nokia N8 also comes with a mechanical shutter, a powerful xenon flash, a 28mm wide-angle lens and a front glass element made out of hardened glass. The built-in ND filter will compensate for the lack of variable aperture in those extremely bright conditions when you just cannot increase the shooting speed any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this promising cameraphone has a rather uncomfortable and not user-friendly camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only three shortcuts available next to the viewfinder. Those allow you to change between camcorder and still camera, toggle the flash and reveal the rest of the customizable settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have made much more sense if some of those settings were brought on the sides of the viewfinder too as it would have saved us a few clicks, but Nokia engineers didn't think so. Not to mention that those settings are the only part of the interface where you can still experience the two-taps-to-select nuisance that plagued the previous version of the Symbian touch interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the basic functionality is mostly there with the N8 allowing you to adjust white balance, color tone, exposure, ISO, contrast and sharpness. You can also go for one of the preset scene modes and there is an option for creating a custom scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection is also available on the Nokia N8, helping you keep the faces in your photos in perfect focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geo-tagging lets you record your current location in the EXIF information of the photos, using the built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our blind test against Samsung Pixon 12 and Sony Cyber-shot HX5v Nokia N8 won your votes and quite convincingly at that. Unfortunately, we had a streak of really bad weather back then and all the photos were shot in overcast conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time however we got a few sunny days and decided to make another Nokia N8 vs Samsung Pixon12 shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing that impressed us about the Nokia N8 is its optical quality. This is not the first time we see a Carl Zeiss-certified lens on a mobile phone, but this one delivered an absolutely stellar performance. None of the dozens of camera samples we shot had any purple fringing, or any barrel distortion (which is quite badly pronounced on the Pixon12) or any other flaw whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of resolved detail is also very impressive with no noticable degradation towards the frame borders. If we had to be extremely picky we'd point the slight softness in the extreme corners but that's stretching it really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 levels of resolved detail are impressive even for a 12 megapixel camera and we are not talking cameraphones only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we especially like about the images produced the N8 camera is the laidback approach to the processing - the bigger sensor simply doesn't need excessive sharpening, edge enhancement or aggressive noise suppression to produce pleasing images. And that's why the N8 lets you enjoy the natural look of the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor size has also blessed the Nokia N8 images with much better dynamic range than its competitors. You can see that on several occasions in the shootout the Nokia N8 managed to retain all the detail in the highlight areas, where one or more of the color channels of its competitor have clipped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low-light photography</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other area where the big sensor counts big time is low light performance. The Nokia N8 lived up to our high expectations here and produced some really impressive shots at ISO 400 and ISO 800. Sure, there is some noise, but the sparing noise suppression has left most of the details intact. In contrast, on the Pixon 12 samples almost all the fine detail is lost because of the aggressive noise suppressing routines</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, in low light conditions with the flash disabled the Nokia N8 tends to chose quite low shutter speeds (as low as 1/8sec). At that kind of speed it's almost impossible to make a photo without camera shake unless you use a tripod or other support for the handset. If you don't have those at hand we'd suggest that you crank the ISO setting higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash photography</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you could just turn the on-board xenon flash on if your subjects are close enough. Let's see how that turns out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 comes with a 30% smaller flash module than the Nokia N82, but Nokia engineers claim that the flash output is the same. Still, the Samsung Pixon12 has an obviously more capable unit - calculations suggest it's up to 30% more powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Nokia N8 excellent high ISO performance compensates for the lower flash range. The Nokia N8 goes for a higher ISO setting so that it achieves the same exposure as the Pixon12 with less light coming from the flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash samples above prove our point. In this flash scene the Nokia N8 selected ISO 383, while the Pixon12 chose ISO 160, while the Sony HX5 went for ISO 200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the large ISO difference the Nokia N8 produces a slightly inferior image but it loses by a very small margin and that says a lot on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What bothers us slightly more is the bluish cast that most N8 flash shots get, meaning there's something wrong with the automatic white balance setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Nokia engineers, one way to get a slightly greater flash range out of the N8 is to use the red-eye reduction mode. Reportedly, this provides around 10-20% more flash power. The team back at Nokia is hard at work on tweaking some settings so that a future software update can bring the improved flash performance to all flash modes, not just the red-eye removal mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro photography</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Macro mode on the Nokia N8 is accessible from the Scenes menu. It's called Close-up but the truth is you can't go as close to your subject as with some other handsets. Best case scenario your frame will cover about 13 cm horizontally. The quality of the shots remains great as usual.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final verdict<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's obviously time for the Samsung Pixon12 to give up its cameraphone crown. The little fella managed to hold onto it for more than a year by using a lot smaller 1/2.5" sensor, which is an impressive achievement on its own. Now however it should make way for the new cameraphone king.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With great dynamic range and excellent low-light performance, lots of resolved detail, geometrically perfect lens and, pleasant, but not overdone colors, the Finnish flagship leaves no doubt as to whether it is worthy of the crown. The only issues we can point out with the camera are the inconvenient user interface and the uninspiring flash photography results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the still camera champion title already in the bag, the Nokia N8 is going to give a try and claim the camcorder cup too. It can capture 720p (1280x720 pixels) videos at 25 frames per second, which sounds like good base for success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed the latest Nokia N8 camera update - check out our impressions of the new 30fps videos and continuous autofocus on Page 11.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, you have every right to argue that 720p@30 fps is better, but you should also remember that big-screen movies are shot at 24 fps and no one complains about that. Plus it?s quite important to note that Nokia N8 is able to maintain its framerate even in very dynamic situations so you won?t see much jerkiness here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet if we had to pick one feature that sets the Nokia N8 videos apart and gives it quite an edge against the competition it?d be the 3x digital zoom. Unlike its competitors the N8 uses the full resolution of the 12MP sensor and retains the HD quality even at full zoom. Digital zoom might make no sense in still imaging, but it works great on video and it?s great someone has finally made good use of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the Nokia N8 digital zoom extensively and we can safely conclude that it works exactly as promised, except in really low light environments, where zooming results in increased noise levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the optical zoom modules too thick for the modern cameraphones this looks like the way to go. The only bad thing we can say about the feature is that it doesn?t work as good in the range of 1x-2x, because of the limitations of the Nokia N8 12MP sensor. You can check our Nokia N8 preview for a demonstration and detailed explanation of the issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another quite unique feature of the video recorder in Nokia N8 is the stereo audio recording. It uses the second, noise cancellation microphone and records excellent stereo sound to go with the sweet footage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you a proper idea of the quality of the videos recorded with the Nokia N8 we prepared two brief shootout videos. The first one puts the N8 head-to-head with the Samsung S8500 Wave, which sports one of the best HD camcorders among cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 19 Oct: The framerate of the Wave videos is 29.97 fps, while the Nokia N8 records at 25 fps. When we originally published the review we had the N8 recording converted to 29.97fps but since that put it in somewhat disadvantageous position, we decided to go the opposite way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We converted the Wave videos down to 25fps. That makes those slightly jerky, but again don't compare framerates and try to focus on the image quality and the exposure shifts instead. Also bear in mind that the YouTube compression has added some additional artifacts, which don?t exist in the original videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&gt;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N8 has a wider field of view, so it fits more in the frame and of course the objects look smaller. Regardless, you can easily tell that it offers better resolution and a lot better dynamic range. The colors are a matter of personal preference, but we tend to like the N8 approach a tad better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the second comparison, this time with Apple iPhone 4. Again, we've converted the iPhone4 videos to 25fps so hence the jerkiness. IT IS NOT the iPhone's real-life performance. Make sure you focus your attention on image quality, dynamic range and exposure shifts instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in the field of view is even bigger this time, so the objects in the iPhone 4 half are a lot bigger and the resolution comparison is harder. Fortunately, we have already tested the video resolution in our preview and concluded that iPhone 4 has the upper hand there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there is a lot more than resolution when we talk about video. The colors in Nokia N8 are a lot more natural, while the oversaturated output of Apple iPhone 4 might look good in a dull weather, but creates all kinds of problems with subjects, which are already colorful. The effect puts an unnatural yellow cast over all subjects and the objects that are already yellow to begin with are often overexposed. The sky suffers as well ? with the blues coming out rather unnatural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, the Nokia N8 has a much better dynamic range ? there are almost no overexposed areas in the above movie. In the iPhone 4 samples on the other hand, overexposure is a common issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing we want to point out in this sample. Look at how the two cameraphones react to the rapidly changing scene in the beginning (sorry for the mad panning, but we had to make a point there). You can clearly see the iPhone 4 reacts a bit slower than the N8 followed by a jerky exposure changes that don?t look so good. The Nokia N8 on the other hand does the exposure compensation so smoothly that you can hardly see it move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 video recording is not withot its flaws too. As you may already know, the Nokia N8 doesn?t use autofocus in video recording. Instead, the Finns chose to use something they call Active Hyper Focal Distance system. In theory, it should allow for videos that have everything in focus from front to back ? as long as the subject you?re shooting is more than 60 cm away from the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our tests however showed that perfect focus ranges from 1m to infinity and this does make a difference, especially with a wide-angle lens like this one. To see the downsides of this approach, we?ve prepared another video sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the beginning, the performer is not really tack sharp. We can easily prove this with a quick jump to the maximum digital magnification the camera offers. Towards the end of the video we take a step back and presto, the performer gets really sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course that same top-notch digital zooming method is the workaround for the longer minimum focus distance. You should simply zoom in on your subject instead of going closer. It sounds quite logical, but it needs getting used to. We would have liked it better if Nokia gave us some way of autofocusing. It doesn?t have to be continuous autofocus for the entire video ? it can just as well auto focus before you start recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally we are very pleased with the Nokia N8 video recording capabilities. The clever, HD quality retaining digital zoom alone was enough to impress us but the N8 didn?t stop there. The resolution it offers is high and the dynamic range is just great. The dynamic adjustment to drastic scene changes is fast, but unobtrusive - simply the best we?ve seen on a mobile. If there were an option for auto or touch focus it could have been perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p video sample from our new test setup. Pay attention to the second half of the video where we lower the light to show you how the the camcorder performs in more challenging conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All round connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Excellent all-around connectivity is the norm with even mid-range smartphones these days so Nokia N8 would have no excuses if it failed to provide in this department. Fortunately, this is not the case as the Finnish flagship offers every data transfer option you would need and then some more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, all kinds of network connectivity options are at your disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSPA (10.2 Mbps HSDPA and 2.0 Mbps HSUPA). The GSM/EDGE networking comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G covers all the five bands available worldwide ? 850/900/1700/1900/2100 MHz. We don?t think we?ve reviewed a penta-band phone before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB is version 2.0, with the standard microUSB port capable of charging the phones besides transferring data. We already covered the USB on-the-go functionality, but just for the record, we had almost 100% success of attaching USB flash drives and other Nokia phones as slave storages, but that?s about it. The Nokia N8 didn?t connect to card readers and phones by other brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth connectivity is version 3.0 and naturally there?s A2DP stereo Bluetooth support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi antenna has support for WirelessN.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there?s the microSD card slot which can be used for transferring data to and from your N8. However both the memory card and the internal memory are accessible when you connect the handset to a computer in Mass storage mode and we managed to get speeds north of 10 MB/s when transferring data this way. That means you?d hardly ever need to use an external card reader .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s the microHDMI port that can output up to 720p video with multi-channel audio (as long as the video source has that). There?s even the right type of cable adapter supplied in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need is a regular HDMI cable that plugs in the adapter on one side and in the HDTV on the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your handset will immediately start streaming a copy of its display to your TV. You do the controlling from the N8 itself, except for the volume, which is now for the TV to manage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you plan on showing your friends some of those 12 megapixel photos you took with the N8 camera on the HDTV, you should know that zooming in isn?t possible straight from the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still zoom in as much as you want, but you will have to go to the image editor (by clicking options and then edit) and use the zooming controls there. We can't quite see the logic behind that though - zooming in from the gallery itself would have been a much more comfortable solution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is rather disappointing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Symbian^3 didn?t deliver the browser overhaul that the platform needs desperately. Despite the added multi-touch and FlashLite 4.0 support the N8 can just watch helplessly as the Android Froyo speeds away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We updated the phone to Symbian Anna - check out our impressions of the new browser on Page 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the good things, the Nokia N8 browser has a good rendering algorithm and offers some nice functionality such as different font sizes (5 options), auto fill-in of web forms and a password manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash Lite 4.0 support is even enough for playing flash videos, but it?s not quite as impressive a performer as the desktop-grade Adobe Flash 10.1 for Android Froyo. You can also choose to switch Flash off to cut down on loading times and save some data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find on page feature allows you search for keywords. The visual history is a nice bonus that can help you find a page you've visited more easily. There's also a popup blocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser supports tabs but there is no other way of opening a new tab but to click on a pop-up link. We'd have really preferred to see an option to open links in new window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping any text zooms it in on screen, but again, the text doesn't auto fit to the smaller viewport and you still need to scroll sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the worst parts of the N8 web browser is entering a web address, which can take up to four steps, while most competing platforms do it with one ? hell, some even do it with voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the Symbian^3 browser is hardly a better copy of its S60 predecessor and that should certainly cost the N8 some points. Internet browsing has never been more popular and until Nokia did something about the usability of their browser, their smartphones will be getting quite a lot of stick for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we could give you an advice here, we?d say get the latest Opera Mobile up and running on you N8 and use the default browser only when you need to access Flash content. The hassle of using two apps for the same purpose is still better than having to deal with the S^3 web browser shortcomings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer all set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian^1 used to have a pretty decent organizer already so all Nokia needed to do is tune it up a bit and slightly polish the touch experience. And that?s exactly what they did ? by taking the same streamlined approach as with the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are three types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has some specific fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 also allows you to browser office documents thanks to the preinstalled Quickoffice application. The Adobe PDF reader is also here to take care of those .PDF files, while the ZIP manager allows you to deal with digital archives on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the Quickoffice version preinstalled doesn?t support editing, but we doubt much of the N8 target audience will need it anyway. Still if you insist, you can purchase the paid update and enable edit mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator application is very familiar but it lacks the functionality of some of its competitors. The square root is the most complicated function it handles and this is no longer considered an achievement. If all you do with it is split the bill at the bar though, you're free to disregard that last sentence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a dictionary, voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The good unit converter we?ve come to know from Symbian^1 is strangely gone but you can grab one yourselves from the Ovi store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. As we already mentioned, thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps 3.04 gives you free lifetime navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 comes with a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a satellite lock from a cold start in just over two minutes (A-GPS turned off). Keeping the lock from then on was not an issue for the N8 even in a relatively dense urban environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably know since the start of the year Nokia made their Ovi Maps navigation free for all their smartphones, which naturally includes the N8 flagship. The voice guidance is currently available in over 70 countries and over 40 different languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia did a pretty decent job with Ovi Maps application itself, blessing it with a cool, touch-friendly interface, as well as nice features such as the Lonely planet city guide, HRS hotels and the Michelin restaurant guide. There's also an events guide that lists all events happening within a 3km range of your position and provides you with details on each one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Ovi Maps 3.04 you get three different view modes including satellite and terrain maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand and can be used with preloaded maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We updated the phone to Symbian Anna, which comes with Maps 3.06. Check out our impressions on Page 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store got an UI refresh<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian is still the best selling smartphone OS worldwide, but you won?t be able to tell that just by browsing the application repositories for the different platforms. The Ovi store is way behind the Android Market, let alone the market-leading App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet there are signs recently that Nokia has finally realized how important apps are to a modern smartphone user. The company has refreshed their Ovi store interface to make it more user-friendly and it is finally making some serious effort to attract more developers. With a user-base as big as its we are more than certain that it will have success with these efforts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are already a few thousand apps there and chances are that the most important apps will be there soon enough. Catching up with the best won?t be easy even if their growth slowed down and currently, there are no signs of a similar trend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Ovi Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections ? Go Green, Tools for Professionals, Homescreen Apps, Highly Addictive Games and Web TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps record of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 is the best Nokia has to offer. A few years back thousands of people would take this to mean the best on the market. Things are not that simple today and Nokia has been learning it the hard way. But the company has been learning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s been a long losing streak for Nokia in the game of touch phones. You can?t expect it to suddenly turn the game around and start beating the snot out of the competition. It makes much more sense to try and be better one step at a time. The best camera in business is one such step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve given up looking for the ultimate smartphone, haven?t we? The Nokia N8 most certainly isn?t in contention there. And Symbian ^3 is not the best touchscreen experience you can get ? although what?s fair is fair ? it?s an improvement over S60 5th. And the Ovi store isn?t the best app market, but the guys behind it try really hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian sucks on touchscreen ? yeah, but there are some nice multimedia features. The web browser is not that good ? yeah, but you get USB-on-the-go. There are better screens out there ? but no better cameras. Not necessarily in this order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 seems capable of sustaining balance. In one particular area, it?s the unquestioned winner. Elsewhere, it?s just fair ? there are ups and downs all along its spec sheet. As always, it boils down to picking your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let?s take a look at the competition to put things in perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave wins a few points against the N8 on pricing and comes with a much better (though slightly smaller) display. The Bada OS offers better touch experience than Symbian^3. Again, it?s the camera that helps the N8 strike back and this time it even has the apps count in its favor. Not to mention that unlike Samsung?s Bada phone, the Symbian smartphone has a very decent and free SatNav solution in the face of Nokia maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8500 Wave</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is the best full-touch cameraphone that the American company has to offer and the N8 won?t avoid comparisons to that one either. The Milestone matches the HDMI capabilities of the Nokia and offers a superior screen (though no AMOLED). Unfortunately, the MILESTONE XT720 is not as impressive as the N8 in terms of image and mostly video quality. Not to mention the rather limited system storage for installing third-party apps. This is a really serious drawback for any Android smartphone that doesn?t use the latest Android OS ver 2.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE XT720</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might also want to consider the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 as a potential alternative to the Nokia N8. With a larger and higher res-screen it also packs a very decent camera (though no HD video, at least for now) so it?s a viable option if you?re shopping for a smart cameraphone. It?s still Android 1.6 though and the XPERIA X10 is more expensive and there?s no HDMI or DivX/Xvid support on that one either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So with free lifetime navigation, some great multimedia features, impressive build quality and little (but important) perks like USB-on-the-go and HDMI, the Nokia N8 can stand its ground against the competition. It?s also only just about starting and Nokia has a reputation for delivering major software updates to its smartphones on a regular basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combination of all the things above is a unique selling point on its own, but it?s the camera that puts the Nokia N8 in a class of its own and changes the nature of the competition altogether. The ultimate cameraphone will always be compared to the best in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 puts the Nseries back to the top where it belongs. Nokia can be proud but they must know it?s just the beginning. Right now they have a winning cameraphone set in pole position. It will be a while before they have one phone to rule them all, if ever.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian Anna debuted a while ago with the Nokia X7 and the E6 but the original quartet of new generation Nokia phones that initially launched with Symbian^3 now gets to join in on the fun as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put a Nokia N8 through the update process and fiddled with it - then we decided you might be interested in a quick Symbian^3 vs. Symbian Anna comparison. X7 and E6 owners might not, but if you have a Nokia N8, C7, C6-01 or E7 you should check this out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start off with how your phone to update to Anna. And while it's going through the process, you can read through the rest of this article to see what changes you can expect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting Symbian Anna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we start comparing Anna to its ^3 predecessor, we'll go over how to update to Anna first. If you've bought an X7 or an E6, you're all set, but those who have the Symbian^3 Nokias need to do this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that Anna is officially out, the simplest way to update is straight on the phone. Get to the Device updates screen (either from Settings or by entering *#0000# into the dialer). Hit Options and choose Check for updates. After the phone confirms there is new software available, hit accept and enjoy Anna after the update process finishes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another way is to use the SW update app, which can be set to check for new update automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is to use Ovi Suite. After connecting your phone, Ovi Suite will check for updates (you can do it manually too) and will show a notification on the top row of buttons. It's a good idea to do a backup of your phone before you start - you have Ovi Suite connected anyhow, best to be safe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're on a Mac, you have Nokia Software Updater at your disposal. It works just like Ovi Suite - connect the phone, app will check for updates and apply them if it finds any.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface changes - better text input, little else<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It may not be immediately apparent to the untrained eye just what exactly Anna does to the homescreen to give it a nudge in the direction of usability. But after using it for a bit, you start to notice things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a new video of the user interface - check out Anna running on the N8:.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new style icons might be the first thing that hits you - the simple, rounded icons are a god new look for Symbian - or it could be that scrolling the homescreen is much more tangible. You "push" the homescreen sideways and it moves, instead of the old homescreen that moved only after you've finished with your swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other things haven?t changed however - the hierarchical menu that is a throwback to a past era is still here. You can rearrange your icons, but the flat menu structure that iOS and Android have popularized is hard to achieve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager that only fits three apps at a time hasn?t changed either - landscape mode offers much more space but it still only fits three. If you're not in the habit of closing your apps, you'll have to do quite a bit of scrolling to switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one UI change that really makes Anna a must-have for Nokia owners is the new text input - lo and behold the split screen keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In previous versions of Symbian you had two options - go to a new screen to enter your text on a full-screen landscape QWERTY and then go back or use that tiny, movable QWERTY keyboard that was basically a pain in the butt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anna however enables the portrait QWERTY, which overlays the bottom half of the screen and lets you stay in the app and type simultaneously. Besides letting you enter text without flipping the phone to its side and without going back and forth in the UI, it enables more subtle changes - like autosuggestion in the web browser that actually works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the portrait QWERTY are a bit small, despite the available screen estate. Still, you can activate word prediction, which will fix the word you're trying to type and show a small popup with the word you actually typed, in case you're trying to enter something like a user name (which doesn?t have to be a valid word, in fact word prediction in this case gets in the way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape QWERTY keyboard is also available in split-screen mode and it offers bigger, easier to hit keys, making it the preferred option for entering long text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's not perfect - several apps would popup the old text edit screen, covering the app screen even though we were using the portrait QWERTY. The Ovi store app is an example of where that happens, which was a little disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while Symbian Anna isn't a huge change in the interface department, it does sand away some of the rough edges of Nokia's aging OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, some of the native apps also received an update, which improved the general functionality of the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Native Symbian apps were updated too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most noticeable change is in the web browser - it's a lot user friendlier now, with its proper URL bar (thanks split-screen QWERTY!), the always visible back button (vital for navigating web pages) and things like manually opening new tabs (before Anna the only way to open a new tab was to set a link open in a new tab).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are changes we've been expecting for ages and we cheered when Nokia put them in the X7 and E6. And now, Nokia's first wave of new Symbians can enjoy it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Anna is not Froyo - Flash is still pretty much no-go on Symbian, with only Flash Lite 4 supported. So, no watching YouTube videos in-browser or playing Flash games. And the new interface, as much as it improves on the old one, is still miles behind Mobile Safari and the Android browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another native Symbian app that got a major improvement is Nokia Maps, which went up to version 3.06. That's the version you get with the new OS update, but v3.06 is available for older Symbian versions and older phones too, so you'll only see a difference if you haven't updated Maps separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the new version brings a redesigned menu and improved search functionality. Also, public transport lines are available on the maps with the new version and you can download country maps directly on the phone (you no longer need a computer to do that). Social network check-ins are also part of the new package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of SNS skills, Anna adds a few niceties here too - you can check out the latest status updates by your friends in their contact cards in the phonebook, you can upload high-res images and add captions to them too. Retweeting has also been added as an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Store has been updated and can now download bigger apps over Wi-Fi but there are no visual changes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressions from Anna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian hasn?t seen any groundbreaking changes in its recent history and Anna isn't one either - like the jump from ^1 to ^3, it's an incremental update that improves things but leaves some rough edges untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong - Anna is the best that Symbian has to offer right now (until Belle arrives anyway) and people with an N8, a C7, C6-01 or E7 should update as soon as possible - the browser alone is a good enough reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N8 owners have a special incentive too - with Anna installed, they can apply the camera update and enjoy 30fps videos with continuous autofocus (and a slightly better UI). Let's face it, people bought N8s chiefly for its camera, so Nokia continuing to improve it is commendable. We've covered that in another post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the number of things left that need changing is much longer than the list of things that have changed. On the other hand, after Nokia announced they'll be focusing on Windows Phone 7, we were worried about Symbian's future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turns out those worries were unfounded - with Anna out now and Belle just around the corner (and there are 1GHz Symbian devices out too), Symbian seems more alive now than it was a year ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a long way to go before it catches up to Android, but we'll be following it (and reviewing it) every step of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What are your impressions - is there still fight left in Symbian or are these updates just a stopgap measure while we're waiting for the Nokia-made WP7 phones to show up?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 got a camera update and we're putting it to the test The update is exclusive to Anna-running N8s but it's an important one</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few words on how we applied the camera update - it's not a part of Anna as it wasn?t finished on time, so it's not updated over the usual channels (it's in experimental testing stages too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you have to download a dedicated app from Nokia Beta Labs (you'd need a registration), then follow the installation instructions. Note that the update only applies to N8s running Anna, so do that update first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 camera update promises three things ? a better interface for the camera, continuous auto-focus during video shooting and smooth 30fps video clips (instead of 24fps). The functionality of the still camera has been left untouched for the most part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Damian Dining himself (the camera guru behind the N8) has taken the time to write a lengthy blog post on Nokia Conversations about this update. We'll try to be brief here but you can check his post for more details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface has been reworked and while it's not perfect, it's better than the old setup. A Settings shortcut has worked its way into the toolbar so it's easier to access and</paragraph>
			<paragraph>selecting a new Scene mode now takes two taps less than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two major changes to video recording - frame rate was bumped up to 30fps (up from 24 fps) and continuous autofocus has been enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until now, the Nokia N8 used an Active Hyperfocal System for capturing videos, which meant that anything from about 60cm away from the camera is always in focus, but anything closer is out of focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The update adds a Close up mode to the video camera, which enables proper autofocus. This is a poor choice of a name, since it focuses on far-away objects too. The Automatic mode seems to be using the old hyperfocal system and doesn?t change the focus as the video is being recorded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we enabled Close up mode and shot a few test videos. The camera allows you to focus before starting the recording, which is nice (the Galaxy S II, for example, would always autofocus in the first second of video, which is quite annoying).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first video you can see how the camera adjusts the focus - it reacts fairly quickly but finding the focus takes longer than we would have liked and it goes back and forth too visibly. Still, for a first outing it's not bad and we expect Nokia's team will optimize it before releasing it to all users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the video we promised:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though some argue that 24fps should be enough (it's the big movie framerate), Damian Dining explains that on electronic cameras increasing the framerate produces smoother videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot our usual street scene, which is good for judging framerate smoothness. Videos hold a very steady framerate of almost exactly 30fps and there are no duplicated frames. A great optimization job by Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And videos are indeed impressively smooth - we still noticed a few uneven spots but only after a fair amount of staring at the videos and those spots were fewer than on other phones. Again, well done, Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One area that needs work is the continuous autofocus - in a scene like this, with lots of movement, it triggered way too often and as you can see, this has a bad effect on the video. We shot a second video with the autofocus turned off and we think you'll agree it looks better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have an untouched 720p@30fps (12s, 17.9MB) video sample for direct download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few other changes to the video camera. The ND filter used in the N8 has been disabled during filming - you can use the exposure compensation if you need to adjust the settings for a bright scene instead. Before the update, when the ND filter engaged it would cause a dropped frame and a "click" in the audio, which is why Nokia decided to disable it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another detail changed by the update is a special feature that cancels out the noise made by the focusing mechanism while doing continuous autofocus, so that it won't spoil the nice stereo sound that the N8 records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera gets improved red-eye reduction performance and a bug regarding Night Portrait mode shooting was squashed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key selling point of the Nokia N8 was the camera - it has other excellent features but the 12MP Carl-Zeiss camera with large sensor and impressive 720p video capture is undeniably the phone's main draw.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Nokia team just made it better - there's still work to be done on it, but we like what we see so far. Nokia acknowledges that the camera interface isn't perfect so they're slowly polishing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But as imaging geeks, we were more interested in the changes to the recording process. The bump to 30fps has gone smoothly and there are no signs that it's overtaxing the hardware. And the videos look better for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The autofocus feature also enables you to shoot a different kind of videos. Nokia N8 users have probably all developed a habit of not shooting anything closer than 60-70cm - well, after you apply this update it will be time to break that habit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Symbian Anna update doesn't bring any game-changing changes (it does offer some features that are practically must-haves), it also enables this update for the Nokia N8, which we think is well worth it. And while it's not FullHD, overall videos look better than what most 1080p-capable phones out there produce right now.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Belle was a huge jump forward in usability for the OS formerly known as Symbian. Now, older models that launched with the tired Symbian^3 and spent some time with Anna, as is the case with the Nokia N8, can finally join their newer brethren.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much we haven't covered in our Belle review, but it's interesting to see how the latest version handles on the old hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps we should begin with a few words about installing the update. It weighs in at around 300MB and you'll need to hook up your phone to a computer running Nokia Suite (3.3 or later) to install it. After that it's a straight forward process, you can watch this step by step video tutorial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here's the Nokia N8 running Belle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything runs pretty smoothly - you can almost forget that you're working with a single 680MHz processor with 256MB RAM. Actually, if you compare this video with the one we shot for Symbian Anna (on the exact same N8 unit), you'll see how much better the browser handles - there's practically no visible redrawing when panning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried running a few benchmarks and they both showed modest improvements. BrowserMark went from 21K to 25K, while Acid3 went 2 points over the 91/100 score that Anna gets on the N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also got a performance boost in Belle, it can now shoot 720p videos at 30fps, however that's no news for the Nokia N8 as it had a special update just for it since Anna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Belle phones will get several nice apps from Microsoft - OneNote and Lync. Details on that will be available soon.</paragraph>
