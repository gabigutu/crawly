			<paragraph>When it comes to cameraphones, the words K800 Cyber-shot always seem to come to mind. The time has come to finally forget it since the famous cameraphone has received a successor in the face of the spanking new Sony Ericsson K810. The same exciting 3.2 megapixel camera packed into a slimmer body and a brand new design. That's enough to start with, we think. Read on for our detailed review on the Sony Ericsson K810.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In February 2007 Sony Ericsson announced several new mobiles as an addition to their product line. Two of them are Cyber-shot cameraphones that would try to build on the success of the Sony Ericsson K800 model. We already reviewed the budget one - the Sony Ericsson K550 which didn't manage to impress. The Sony Ericsson K810 though is entirely a different story. It comes as an update to the K800. The upgrades over the previous version include a slimmer design due to the smaller active camera cover and dedicated camera options keys that allow for easier picture taking. While those upgrades don't seem much on paper, we are prepared to see whether the K810 really makes it worthwhile to dump your current K800 and go get a hold on the latest Sony Ericsson top-of-the-line cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In much the same way that K800 had its twin EDGE brother in the face of K790, now the K810 model also has an EDGE twin - the Sony Ericsson K818 which will be targeted at the Chinese market. The Sony Ericsson K810 and the K818 will be available within Q2 2007 in two colors: Noble Blue and Golden Ivory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that the test unit we got is a pre-release one and some bugs are really acceptable at this product development stage. Some options and applications may vary in the final retail version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Heads on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Visually Sony Ericsson K810 doesn't differ much from the K800. It has the same form factor and pretty much the same color and size. It is several millimeters thinner than K800 and the most significant design change is the new keypad which is unusual for the recent Sony Ericsson line of phones as a whole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson K810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TFT display takes up the most part of the front panel. It has a mirror-like finish much like the K800 does and in much the same way it catches fingerprints rather easy. Above it there is the secondary VGA camera, the in-call speaker and two multimedia shortcut keys. Those were present in K800 too but here they are more prominent. Now they even have blue icons marking their functions. When the camera is on, the left one can be used to change the camera shoot mode, while the right one changes the Scene setting. When the camera is off, the left one opens the last picture you've browsed in fullscreen mode, while the right one opens the camera pictures in thumbnail mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson K810 - speaker, secondary camera and multimedia shortcut key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there is the keypad with the usual Sony Ericsson soft keys and the newly-designed round metallic keys. The leftmost column of the alphanumeric keys serves the double purpose of dedicated camera keys for changing the picture resolution, auto focus mode, self-portrait timer and flash options. Icons with blue backlighting explain the function of each key. The keys "3" and "6" can also be used for zooming in and out when taking pictures. The alphanumeric keys design us rather controversial, but more on navigation and keypad user-friendliness is to come later on in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson K810 keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K810 left side features only the Memory Stick Micro M2 memory card slot and a dedicated Radio start/stop key. Viewing the K810 from this angle allows you to see that the active camera cover is much thinner and doesn't bulge from the body of the mobile the way it did on the Sony Ericsson K800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   K810 left side: memory card slot cap and radio shortcut key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the K810 features the regular Fast Port, the in-call microphone and an eyelet for attaching a wrist or neck strap. The top part of the device incorporates only the On/Off key which can also be used for fast switching of the ringing profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    K810 bottom and top sides</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Sony Ericsson K810 hosts the camera shutter key which is styled in the way the keypad keys are and bulges slightly so it is easier to press and use. Next to it is the Infrared port and in the upper part of the right side we find the volume keys which can be used for zooming when taking or browsing pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   K810 right side: camera shutter key, Infrared port and volume keys</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone over reveals the real eye candy - the 3.2 megapixel camera with its active cover, the loudspeaker and the Xenon flash. The back panel itself is made of matt plastic and except for the camera lens cover, it does not catch fingerprints that easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    K810 back panel: camera, flash, loudspeaker</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we slide open the back over, the standard Sony Ericsson Li-Polymer BST-33 battery with a capacity of 950 mAh gets revealed. Right beneath it is the SIM card bed which is a regular Sony Ericsson one meaning that the SIM card is easy to slide in and hard to slide out. The same battery is used by Sony Ericsson K550, W850 and W880, just to mention a few. According to the manufacturer, the battery should last up to 400 hours of standby mode and up to 10 hours of talk time when used in GSM-only network. Unfortunately, we couldn't test the phone's battery life since we used it heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced was not indicative for the real-life performance of the phone. But judging on other devices with this battery we think that it's a safe bet that with average usage the K810 battery would most probably max out at 4 days.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Generally we are quite pleased with the general ergonomics of the Sony Ericsson K810. It feels nice when held in hand and fits perfectly in your palm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>For the viewer's pleasure<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are quite pleased with the Sony Ericsson K810 display. It is a 262K colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution and a 2" diagonal. Two inches is not that much for a high-end multimedia mobile phone these days. Yet we find it enough. Legibility in bright light conditions was not the best in previous Sony Ericsson models. They surely were legible but not anywhere close to the displays Nokia uses in their middle to higher range of mobile phones based on the Nokia S40 user interface. The situation got better with the Sony Ericsson W880, but here we again see the good old display used in K800 for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Joystick: playing hard to get<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While generally we couldn't find any fault in the K810 design and construction, the keypad was the source of our greatest disappointment. And it's not the controversial alphanumeric keys we are talking about. The weakest point of the otherwise rather user-friendly handset is among the most important ones - the navigation joystick and the soft keys. The joystick is too sunk in for the user to be able to push it easily up or down. It doesn't matter if it's a man's thumb or a girls' one, the result is the same - a lot of frustration. The other problem - the one with the soft keys is that they are actually toî stiff to press and they give almost no positive feedback when pressed. On K800 the web browser key and the Activity menu key were stuck in-between the soft keys and that made it hard for us to use the soft keys. The K810 no longer has that problem but it seems that Sony Ericsson have totally lost it with the keypad and navigation here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The bothersome joystick</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the alphanumeric part of the keypad has a relatively even white backlighting. A certain flaw we see which may be attributed to the fact that our test handset is a pre-release version is that the blue camera icons on the left side of the keypad are constantly lit while on paper they should light up only if the camera is on. In the same time the icons beside the upper shortcut keys above the display have no backlighting at all. We hope that all that would be fixed in the final version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony at its usual level<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K810 manages great at making and receiving calls. Not that we would expect any less than that. Unfortunately, the loudspeaker wasn't the loudest one we've seen. It certainly lacks bass elements but that is something usual for a mobile phone.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: doesn't need introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in K810 is a standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson user interface. Honestly we've slowly becoming fed up with the user interface - it's been around for 2 years now that they haven't changed it a bit. It offers great user-friendliness but new mobiles equipped with it don't offer any new functionality over previous models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K810 has a dedicated Flight mode. When turning on the phone, you are presented with the option to start it directly into Flight mode. The phone cannot work in Flight mode unless there is a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm that's due to go off. Pressing the navigation pad in any of the four directions can start a given feature or application according to the user preference. The main menu itself is made of a matrix grid with 4 x 3 animated icons. All sub-menus are in listed view with tiny icons on the left side. The phone reacts and performs fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standby view ? the main menu ? a listed sub menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several themes that come preinstalled in the phone. They change the color scheme, the wallpaper and sometimes even the menu icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Three of the preinstalled themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an Activity menu which has a dedicated shortcut key on the keypad. The Now running tab of the menu offers multi-tasking - for example you can run two Java applications and listen to the radio or to the music player simultaneously. The Activity menu also offers quick access to recent events, the web menu and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of frequently used features and can be modified to the user preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The four tabs of the Activity menu</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: numbers come close<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and easy to use. You can choose whether the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be the default for the phonebook. Both lists cannot be displayed simultaneously. Otherwise, a nice option is that you can make the phone to autosave to the SIM card any new contacts that you save in the phone's memory. The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts but you can save up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. They are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Contacts list ? Free memory status</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are five possibilities for the phone number: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture and a custom ringtone. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. When you add the birth date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and put down a reminder for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact details</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided in four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs altogether contain up to 30 call records, which are shared between the separate tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calls log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No news about messaging either<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the common Inbox. Only email messages have their own separate Inbox. The phone also offers a RSS feeds reader that in fact uses the NetFront web browser. When writing a message, there is a character counter, which activates when you reach 20 characters before the 160 limit. Of course, there is the T9 dictionary to assist the typing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sound is always exciting with Sony Ericsson<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K810 music player supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI file formats. It is nothing special and looks just as your regular Sony Ericsson Walkman player used in the W-series of the Swedish manufacturer. The only difference is that it doesn't feature the MegaBass equalizer preset. Since Sony Ericsson K810 supports multi-tasking, the player can be set to run in background. Sound is nice - given you use the player with a nice headset, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Music player menu ? The Now playing screen ? player options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of K810 is nice and offers the option to watch videos in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Playing a video: portrait and landscape modes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of the Sony Ericsson K810 has a memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Tuning in a station</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pictures don't come second either<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing new in the file browser department as well. It allows you to mark files (single or multiple), copy them, move them, and also create and delete folders as you please. There are three tabs of file lists - one for the phone memory files, one for the memory stick files and one mutual for all files. By selecting a given tab you can filter the files shown. The integrated memory of the K810 is 64MB. There is also a Memory Stick Micro M2 memory card slot. The size of the memory card shipped in the retail package should be 128MB which is far too insufficient for a 3 megapixel cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The phone memory tab ? available memory space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your pictures is as easy as ever - you could do that in a list view with or without thumbnails. You can also view your pictures as a thumbnail grid of 3 x 3 or 5 x 5. The video files can also be browsed as thumbnails. If you highlight a video thumbnail it starts playing as a preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    List view ? thumbnails list view ? 3 x 3 grid view? 2 x 2 grid view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interesting thing about the file browser is the Timeline view, which allows you to filter the pictures according to the month they have been taken in. After you specify the month, you could even choose the exact date. That sort of image filtering is offered by computer picture browsers and digital cameras. The Timeline sorting is seen more and more often lately in the recent Sony Ericsson phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browsing March pictures ? browsing pictures made on 3rd of March</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves vertically (in portrait mode) just as you would on any other phone or horizontally (in landscape mode) if you prefer. When viewing the pictures one by one the phone preloads a lower quality preview in order to allow you fast browsing. Once you find a picture, you would like to see in its full glory you should stop browsing for a second and the phone would load it with its normal quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the pictures in landscape mode is much more natural</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even more, up to 32x. Given the available megapixel count zooming further than 8x doesn't really reveal more details but produces only smudged spots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Zooming in: 2x; 8x; 32x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While browsing pictures you can easily do a little bit of editing on them or send them as MMS and email or via Bluetooth and Infrared. If you intend to do detailed editing of the picture, the PhotoDJ application is at your disposal. With its help you can easily adjust levels, light balance, brightness and contrast, remove unwanted red-eye effect, apply some color effects to the picture such as negative and sepia, or you can add a frame or a text to the picture. We are pleased with its capabilities - it does great with removing red eyes without spoiling the whole picture.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Not a real camera upgrade<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K810 has the same camera as the one in K800 so we wouldn't expect more from it. The user interface has received a slight facelift but we already saw that in Sony Ericsson K550 and in Sony Ericsson W880 which we reviewed not long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera viewfinder ? using the new camera keys ? viewfinder interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, and burst shooting modes. It also features white balance correction. Several color effects are available, too. The BestPic shoot mode is present here - it lacked in the Cyber-shot cameraphone Sony Ericsson K550 but then again it had a Burst shot mode which slightly compensated for the fact. There is a macro mode plus some controls for the Xenon flash which yet remains the only flash of this type used in a mobile phone. The flash has a Red eye reduction option which makes the light output a bit weaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Some camera menu options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson claims that the camera module and the software in the new K810 model is exactly the same as in the older K800 model, which we got to know well from our shootouts. Anyway, we decided to snap a few photos just to be sure. For some reason, K810 handles the macro shots in the studio better than the K800 unit. The colors are spot on and the auto-focus is absolutely reliable. You can see here how K800 performed under the same conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>               </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the outdoor shots is high as expected. We were pleased to see that the reddish cast in some of the K800 outdoor photos is now gone for good. The photos indoors are not bad at all, but somewhat lack contrast. This problem exists with Sony Ericsson K800 too, but it's more pronounced here, at least with our beta test unit. If you open some of the samples in a photo editor and adjust the levels you will see that the histogram is pushed to the right. A simple auto-level command will greatly improve the indoor images. Even the Auto-level command in PhotoDJ takes care of this problem very successfully - take a look at the example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K810 should have come with a Photo Fix application that allows for a quick remedy for dark pictures. It should have been integrated into the camera interface, but as it seems our test pre-release version doesn't feature it at all. So expect an update on that functionality as soon as the mobile is made publicly available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with K810 are captured at the low QCIF resolution. The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences. It's about time that Sony Ericsson upgrades the video recording capabilities of their mobile phones. Until that happens we will no longer publish sample video clips taken by Sony Ericsson phones - there isn't that much to see really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the secondary VGA camera is nice. The other party's video feed is viewed in a large frame in the middle of the screen while you view your own image in a small frame in the lower left corner. There is also a possibility to view your own image mirror-like, meaning that the image gets reversed and looks as if you are staring at yourself in a mirror. It's much more natural that way. You can also zoom digitally your image at a 2x degree or choose to replace your live video feed with a picture of your taste. You can also do that during an actual video call and it's handy when you want to show the other call party an interesting picture you have taken for example. The options don't end here. You can further on control the exposure compensation of the camera or even switch it into a night mode. There are 3 different video quality modes: Smooth, Sharp and Normal. Smooth delivers a smoother picture flow while Sharp provides more detailed images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video calls camera</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NetFront is gaining popularity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides 3G and GPRS for fast data transfers, video calls and streaming content support, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as the USB support, Bluetooth and Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we tested, the integrated HTML Access NetFront Internet browser is at a good level and it does its job more than all right. It has a lot of options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser manages well with fitting the web content into the screen. Scrolling is fast once the page has loaded completely. Our impression is that the Smart-fit function has got an upgrade and does its job better than on previous Sony Ericsson models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Browsing GSMArena.com ? some of the browser options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's try browsing the same way without the Smart-Fit function switched off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browsing GSMArena.com with Smart-Fit off</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K810 supports Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP profile, which means that you could use a stereo Bluetooth headset with it. Most recent hi-end phones support A2DP and as we saw at the 3GSM Congress 2007 held in Barcelona this February, the stereo Bluetooth functionality both in handsets and in headsets will become more wide spread than ever. The handset also has the Human Interface Device (HID) Bluetooth profile which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Further on, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for Internet access of a PC or a mobile computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K810 has support for local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC while the remote synchronization is with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has two modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K810 offers many time organizing features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Alarms, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily view. As we mentioned before, when you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone asks you if you wish to add it in the calendar too. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Reminders can be put as Subjects. Notes are written as messages; there is even the T9 dictionary to assist writing. There are five alarms available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat it on chosen days of the week or everyday. Furthermore, you can add text and a picture to the alarm as well as set its behavior in case the time that the alarm is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Organizer menu ? Calendar ? Alarms</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder doesn't have any limit in the duration of the recordings since all the free memory is available for the purposes of the application. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one, which you have probably already seen. It offers the basic functions with no bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Voice recorder ? Calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include the MusicDJ and VideoDJ. VideoDJ is for making video clips from scratch or for editing existing recording using special transition effects and by adding background music. It can be a very amusing application. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, an interesting and funny one is the FaceWarp application, which is used for manipulating portrait shots by adding funny faces and grimaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a HP Print application which allows for direct printing of pictures, contacts or calendar events to a real or virtual printer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The HP Print application ? printing pictures ? finding printers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Music Mate application comes preinstalled within Walkman phones, the Sony Ericsson K810 cameraphone comes equipped with the brand new Photo Mate application which offers various aids and practical tips and tricks for making great pictures.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games: back to basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two games preinstalled in our test Sony Ericsson K810 are nothing new: the Tetris like QuadraPop game and the amusing tennis game Sony Ericsson WTA Tour. Unfortunately, the test beta unit had some problems with running the QuadraPop game - here are some screenshots of the WTA Tour only.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K810 tries to build on the success of its predecessor and tries to win the heart of the customers with enhanced user-friendliness of the camera. It manages to do so - taking pictures and changing camera options has never been easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We find the somewhat controversial design of the keypad nice and using it doesn't prove to be any hindrance to the overall "user-friendly" idea of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some greater flaws that we really couldn't live with - the highly inconvenient joystick and the hard soft keys. After all a badly designed navigation solution can spoil the experience of using even the greatest phone possible. That drawback is even more surprising since obviously the Sony Ericsson designers have put a lot of efforts into usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our final verdict is that given the serious design flaws and the lack of serious upgrades, you should stay with the Sony Ericsson K800 until a better cameraphone comes up on the market. What is more, once the K810 hits the market, the price of the K800 should drop down so it would become a great buy.</paragraph>
