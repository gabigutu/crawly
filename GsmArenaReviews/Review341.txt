			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>CES 2016 is now well underway and while we are not exactly complaining, calling it a great year would definitely be a stretch and us being nice more than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset and handset-related announcements at the Las Vegas venue have been thinning out the past few years and it has now gotten to a point where most OEM's tend to reserve high-profile devices and major announcements for different crowds, like MWC or their own private events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the situation is far from catastrophic. Indeed, some manufacturers had more modest product lines to showcase and as such, they didn't warrant a dedicated article of their own. So on the following pages, you will find the report of our hands-on experience with various smartphones and tablets made by manufacturers who didn't go big at CES 2016, but still deserved our attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while phones are definitely our specialty, we couldn't help but stop by other geeky gadgets on display and we will be sharing those with you as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stay tuned, as we will be updating this article tomorrow with more new pages and devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, you can check out this cool video from the CES 2016 Unveiled event to give you an early peek at what CES is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now join us on the next page where we give the just announced ZTE Grand X3 the proper hands-on treatment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Grand X 3 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One booth we definitely made sure to visit during out time at the Las Vegas venue was ZTE's. The Chinese OEM has managed to build quite a reputation in the tech realm both at home and abroad. Despite lacking the "hip" factor as some of it up and coming rivals, like Xiaomi or Meizu, the ZTE brand is definitely popular, especially in the US, which was keenly pointed out during the keynote. And we're not just talking about networking and enterprise communication hardware, the OEM can also boast an ever expanding device market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year, during the presentation, ZTE focused more on expanding its reach and bettering customer service, thanks to a new and improved PASSPORT 2.0 international protection plan, but still managed to squeeze in a couple of device announcements. The ZTE Grand X 3 and Avid Plus made their debut on stage and while both are entry-level offers and far from showstoppers, it is a lot more than many other OEMs had to show, so the devices deserve a quick rundown if nothing else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand X 3 is a modest device by design that doesn't really feel the need for some special features or little touches to stand out. On the contrary, the 5.5-inch device simply blends in and is really quite a throwback to a rounder and more toned down handset design - the kind that was popular a few years ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plastic all around with no sharp corners, edges, latches or a camera bump, the Grand X 3 reminds us of a Samsung of Motorola handset from two or three years ago. The analogy might actually be spot on, when we consider the ZTE Grand X 3's back, which slopes from all four sides towards the center, just like, the original Motorola Moto G, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not much else can be said about the design really. The only signature aspect of the handset is the round circular capacitive home button on the front, flanked by two single dots for the other controls - in typical ZTE fashion. Other controls include a volume rocker and power button on the right-hand side, just where they belong and a 3.5mm jack on top, that's it. The unit fits snugly in the hand, thanks to the grippy plastic, agronomical slopes all around and moderate size, at least by today's standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the hardware side of things, well, don't expect much. The Grand X 3 packs a 5.5" 720p screen and a Snapdragon 210 with 1.3GHz quad-core CPU and 2GB of RAM to keep things going. This setup is hardly going to top any benchmarks, but with Android 5.1 on board, the unit actually does quite alight with no noticeable hiccups within the UI and basic operation, which will most likely be all that is expected by future consumers anyway. It also has an 8MP camera at the back and a 2MP front one, while its 16GB storage is expandable via a microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, the Grand X 3's specs sheet does have some unexpected high-points as well, like the 3,080 mAh removable battery, that considering the hardware platform, should provide above average battery life. Also, oddly enough, the handset comes with a reversible USB Type-C port - a luxury not very common at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the ZTE Grand X 3 is said to cost $130 at launch and will be available shortly on Cricket Wireless in the US.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung might have skipped on mobile announcement entirely, but the Korean giant still made sure to brings it's A-game to CES 2016 with a grand and beautiful exposition that featured a lot of varied tech, some of which announced for the first time at the venue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What started out as a quick browse, actually ended up consuming quite some time, simply due to the sheer amount of awesome tech Samsung had laying around literally all over the place - on tables, shelves elevated in mid-air and even hung from the walls - it was geek heaven! Here is a quick overview of our take on the gadgets we managed to get our hands on, starting with the new exquisite editions of the Gear S2 Classic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gear S2 Classic in Rose Gold and Platinum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung didn't bring any radical new wearable to Las Vegas. The Gear S2 Classic is a well-known product, which we've already reviewed. However, it now comes in two new flavors. One of the new variations is plated with 18K rose gold, while the other is plated with platinum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The strap is leather, just like on the original and the rose gold one has it in white, which is arguably a better fit. Of course, you could also swap it for any after-market solution and a lot of options do exist, like the somewhat odd hole-happy one that came with one of our test units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the new dye, not much else has changed on the Gear S 2 Classic. It is still one of the select few options in the smartphone realm that pulls off a convincing impression of a classic timepiece, without looking tacky or bulky (well, the rose gold might be too much bling for some, but it is still not over the top).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body is shaped just right, making for a snug fit on the wrist and the rotating bezel control is the thing that makes the Gear S2 unique and sets it apart from the crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another point in this respect goes out to Samsung's decision to persevere with the custom Tizen-based OS. It is almost always a big gamble to stray away from the pack, which in this case would be the ever-expanding Android Wear ecosystem and go for an alternative approach. However, Samsung has managed to craft one truly powerful and versatile OS for its round wearable, with a lot of consideration for the shape, style, unique controls, as well as care for the users and developers alike. And while Tizen is still somewhat lacking on the software front, the latter group has been exhibiting a lot of interest for the easily extensible platform, which might quickly fill the gap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is also doing its part and working hard to win over as many fans as possible and expand developer support, as evident by the announcement that it will be offering support for iOS as well later this month.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy TabPro S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on, Samsung had a lot of PC announcements to make at CES 2016. The OEM introduced an updated pair of Series 9 ultralight notebooks - 13.3 and 15 inch. Both can be specced to offer up to an Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, all within thin and light chassis, weighing in at 840 grams and 1.29 kilograms, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the lower-end register, the company announced a new metal-clad Chromebook 3 model. is equipped with an Intel Celeron N3050, 16GB of storage, 2GB of 4GB of RAM as well as 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0. The screen is a 11.6" panel with a 1366 x 768 resolution. It runs Google's own cloud-based OS and boasts up to 11 hours of battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, comes the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S. It is a stylish 2-in-1 or convertible device, although Samsung was very adamant in referring to it as a PC instead of anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This, of course, is done for the purpose of instilling a sense of advance productivity. With a 12-inch Super AMOLED QHD display, 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core M chip inside, it should be capable enough of pushing through most computing tasks on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The comfort and usability of this particular form factor are an entirely different story, and it comes down to the personal preference and whether or not you can get used to a keyboard-case, which, frankly, has almost no key travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the plus side, however, the keyboard attachment will be included in the bundle, unlike the proprietary Bluetooth Pen and multi-port adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pen works pretty well in a productivity context - selecting quickly and precisely and dragging things around, but it didn't particularly impress when we endeavored to use it for drawing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the multi-port hub, well, it is kind of an essential accessory to get as the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S only offers two ports - a 3.5 mm audio jack and a single, USB Type-C one. It is used for absolutely everything in terms on peripherals, as well as charging. The port adaptor is the only way to add an HDMI port and a regular USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there is still an upside to the lack of ports - it is all in the name of keeping the profile as thin as possible. With a thickness of 6.3mm and a weight of 693 grams, the Galaxy TabPro S is more than thin and light. Even with the case on, it looks slick from any angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the shell also houses a quite large 5,200 mAh battery, as well as a duo of 5MP cameras - one on the back and the other on the front and can be configured with 128GB or 256 GB of SSD storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device was showcased in classic white and black options, with no complaints whatsoever to materials and build quality. While open on a desk, it draws attention, and the display angle works quite well, but we still found it quite off and clumsy when trying to hold it in hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will be available in Wi-Fi and LTE models this February, but the pricing is still not clear. Apart from the pen and small port hub, Samsung will also be offering a couple of dock solutions that you can hook up and leave at your desk.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Portable SSD T3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung hit big in the memory department this year as well. At their booth, we found an impressive array of thumb drives, the PRO Plus and Evo Plus line of SD cards, as well as a range of SSDs. But, we couldn't skip over one of them in particular - the company's new Portable SSD T3 that was only recently announced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is essentially a refreshed version of last year's T1 model with an array of improvements, like vertical NAND (V-NAND) memory, capable of read and write speeds of up to 450 MB/s. But perhaps the biggest upgrade is the capacity - the T3 is available in 250GB, 500GB, 1TB as well as the whopping 2TB of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By all accounts, however, the major tradeoff to the extra storage was a bigger footprint in the new version, and we were curious to see how big the device ended up being in real life. The increase is all but unnoticeable. Samsung's portable SSD is still a marvel of technology; and it's so compact that you can practically carry it around in a shirt's pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have little doubt that for the right user, this extremely compact external SSD will be invaluable. The T3 also offers a USB Type-C connector with support for the speedy USB 3.1 standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also offers an Android app to monitor storage and also make use of password-based AES 256-bit hardware encryption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Portable Storage T3 will go on sale next month in Korea, China, the US and a few EU markets and while there are alternatives already available, like SanDisk's 2TB model, none is quite as compact or as stylish as Samsung's T3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vivo X6Plus hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo X6Plus is a 5.7-inch device and it's the bigger sibling of the Vivo X6, which we already previewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pair of X6 phones is only available in China at the moment, but that didn't stop the company from showcasing them at the CES 2016. Nevermind, their international versions are due quite soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivo X6 Plus is perhaps the first device we see running the latest Snapdragon 616 chipset, which makes use of 8 Cortex-A53 cores running at a maximum clock speed of 1.7 GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On its back, the smartphone has a 13MP camera, which can shoot 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like with the smaller Vivo X6, the X6 Plus impressed us with its slim profile, all metal body and amazing SuperAMOLED display (albeit at 1080p resolution).</paragraph>
