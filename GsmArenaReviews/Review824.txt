			<subsectionTitle>The GSMArena tablet buyer's guide: June 2014<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been a while since we published the last edition of our tablet buyer's advice series. That's mainly down to the lack of much movement in the market since March. But we've been keeping a close eye on all developments and we are now ready to present you the latest edition of our tablet buyer's guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tablets may not be as prominent on this website as smartphones but we are equally passionate about both. And as much as we enjoy testing the latest gadgets in and out, we hope too that while doing that we help you make informed buying decisions. That's what these buyer's guides are for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cater to a quite diverse international audience, so most of the times we won't be mentioning specific prices but we're sure you'll recognize a deal when you see one. Our job would be to list what we think are the best tablets out there, so you'd be safe whichever of these you go for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've broken down our tablet recommendations into three distinct categories: compact, midsize, and full-size. As of this issue, we will be catering to mainly Wi-Fi-only devices, but we'll make sure to mention 3G/LTE-enabled options as we go. On each page the different options will be listed according to their price range - from affordable to ridiculous, each with their own merits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get things started in the compact tablet category. Compacts are growing in popularity not only in casual living room environments, but also out in the open and even in corporate scenarios, thanks to their versatility and portability. This category also offers the cheapest way to get into tablets in the first place so we assume there would be a lot of first-time buyers here. What may be surprising is that our recommendations list is the shortest in the compact category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, mid-size tablets are for people who want a bit more screen estate all the while maintaining portability. There is not a clear-cut definition for a mid-size tablet - it can range from anywhere between 7.5 to 9 inches. We'll make sure to give you plenty of choice when it comes to finding the right combination of size, features, and price. This is the newest category of the three and it might as well attract new tablet users who have been so far unwilling to commit to either of the two extremes of the tablet range - the 7-inchers and the 10-inchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, full-size tablets are those that touch or cross the 10" mark. This is where top manufacturers like Samsung, Sony, and Apple will duke it out for dominance. Some of these tablets are just a keyboard away from compact laptop territory, so that's another way you may want to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each section, we order our recommendations starting with the cheapest, most worthwhile tablets available from a reputable manufacturer. While so-called "whitebox" offerings from lesser-known makers are surging and account for a huge portion of the tablet growth - particularly ones running Android. However, their affordable price is oftentimes the result of using low-cost components and they simply don't offer a reliable and consistent user experience (let alone regular software updates).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above all, we value tablets with high-grade screens, robust performance, good build quality and rich connectivity options. We consider a poor screen to be a deal breaker and having wide viewing angles with no serious shift in colors and contrast is a must for a solid tablet user experience. Where possible, we would always pick a higher resolution screen as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't consider cameras to be important on tablets and if you are only going to view your photos on the tablet's screen, then a high resolution camera is hardly a must. Still, we'll try and mention when a particular tablet has a camera worthy of using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like seeing tablets with card slots to cheaply top up the built-in storage but we reckon 16GB is the minimum built-in memory you should consider. For modern day tablets without card slots, we always recommend getting the 32GB version, as a mere 16GB of storage simply doesn't cut it anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page we get started with our compact tablet recommendations but you can jump right to what you're looking for using the links below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, just sit back and enjoy the June 2014 edition of our tablet buyer's guide page by page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Compact tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this chapter, we'll be focusing on compact tablets measuring about 7". These tablets oftentimes come with 3G or LTE-enabled variants, which can be great for when you need connectivity on the go - and let's face it, seven-inch or thereabout is the only tablet size that's truly portable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've sorted the following by price, although keep in mind that pricing and availability can vary widely by region. Mobile internet-enabled tablets are oftentimes available from mobile carriers at special discounts, which adds another wrinkle to the equation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get things underway with the Nook HD tablet from Barnes &amp; Noble (available in the US and the UK). There have been murmurs of a new Nook model simmering in the background since our previous guide, but nothing has been announced in that regard as of yet, and the Nook continues to be one of the best deals around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a 7-inch 1440 x 900 display, alongside a rather modest 1.3GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 processor. What the Nook really has going for it, however, is the price - it costs $129/ ?79 respectively. That's less than ?100, so it's a price other major manufacturers simply can't beat. How long that will last, however, is anyone's guess, and it could be that B&amp;N is clearing its inventory prior to announcing its next model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some sacrifices were inevitable, of course, and those come in the form of performance and availability. The Nook's TI OMAP 4470 processor is passable at best in terms of processing power and, given that Texas Instruments has retired from the chipset game, it could have difficulty getting future Android versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also all Nook tablets come with a custom Nook UI, which is quite far from a true Android experience, so you better know your rooting/CyanogenMod if you want vanilla Android. Still, the Google Play store is available, so your app needs will be covered without any hacks needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is a compact tablet from Asus that has aged nicely. The Asus MeMo Pad HD7 has made it onto our previous two guides, and thanks to its expandable storage and a relatively recent Android version it continues to be relevant. The fact that its price continues to fall doesn't hurt either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD7 offers a quad-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. For all intents and purposes, it's a cheaper version of the original Google Nexus 7 (also made by Asus), except that it's running on MediaTek chipset and has a microSD card slot for expanding the limited memory - it's either 8GB or 16GB of built-in storage with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is a bit low on pixel density, but it's an IPS LCD unit so it offers excellent side viewing angles making for a nice user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Previously, Samsung's Galaxy Tab lineup didn't make it onto our guide simply because there were more capable offerings at lower price ranges. With the Galaxy Tab 4 series Samsung has put their lower cost tablets back on our wish lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to a Wi-Fi only model, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 offers the same basic package as the MeMo Pad HD7, for example, except that it's priced slightly higher. That definitely makes it a hard sell, but let's not forget it enjoys the latest Android 4.4 KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Samsung has priced the LTE edition very competitively, and the sub-?300 price tag is the cheapest price at which you can find an LTE-enabled tablet. If you need a competitively priced compact tablet that you can take on the go, the Tab 4 7.0 and its 4G connectivity is unbeatable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second generation Nexus 7 tablet caused quite a stir at its unveiling last summer, and although the price hasn't dropped significantly, it's still a very compelling offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google and Asus really went out of their way to give the Nexus 7 a complete and thorough upgrade for the 2013 model. The tablet is powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset with Adreno 320 GPU, and 2GB of RAM. The Nexus 7 is still one of the few tablets to run the latest Android 4.4 KitKat, as well. Not to mention it's pretty much the only compact tablet to come with built-in wireless charging capabilities, which is a nice perk even though you'd need the optional wireless charger for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, it's the only one of our tablet recommendations that weighs below 300 grams. The only real downside is that is has no memory card slot, so you should definitely pay the premium to get the 32GB model. The user available storage on the 16GB version simply doesn't cut it by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in terms of raw horsepower, nothing beats the Kindle Fire HDX in this class. It runs on a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and Adreno 330 GPU, alongside 2GB of RAM. Like the Nexus 7, it hasn't dropped much in price (read: it's pricey), but unlike the Nexus 7 its Android version is highly customized and does not have Google Play support. Instead, you'll have to rely on the less-varied Amazon App Store for your app needs and have Amazon's web services replace Google's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card slot on this one either, so we'd recommend at least the 32GB version if you decide to go for the latest Kindle Fire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Possessing a distinct iPhone-like design, the Huawei MediaPad X1 is another tablet that can make and receive calls - and it's also probably the most expensive tablet on this page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had a chance to check the X1 out at the MWC 2014 in February and our impressions are only positive. Tthe unusual choice of chipset model - Huawei's in-house quad-core HiSilicon Kirin 910 - will probably serve it well, as our tests of the Ascend P7 smartphone showed it performs around the level of a Snapdragon 600 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7-inch screen with a resolution of 1200x1920px is certainly eye-catching, not to mention the extremely skinny bezels. On the back there is even a 13MP camera, while on the front, there is a 5MP one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also got a clever technology, which allows it to charge other devices via the microUSB slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, this one doesn't come cheap - it costs around ?400 or about the same as a well-equipped 5- or 6-inch smartphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Midsize tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's hard to determine where exactly compact ends, midrange begins, and full-size takes over, which is why the screen diagonal margin in this chapter will be fairly large. But, if you're the Goldilocks of tablets and find compact too small and full-size too big, then it's a safe bet that at least one of the tablets mentioned in this section should feel just right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to take your tablet on the go, then being able to rely on a 3G and/or LTE connection is almost a must, so we'll be specifying which of the below models come with a telephony support as well. As before, the tablets in this section are listed by price in ascending order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Archos continues to build a reputation for affordable yet competitive Wi-Fi-only tablets and its most capable 8-inch offering is exactly that. The Archos 80b Platinum comes with a quad-core 1.6GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. Its screen resolution is a paltry 1024 x 768px, but it's an IPS LCD with excellent viewing angles. The 4:3 aspect ratio provides more effective screen estate for reading and web browsing than 16:9 tablets of the same diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True, it has only 8GB of internal memory (which you'll need to expand via the microSD card slot), but it does come with all-metal body ala iPad mini and it has a microHDMI port, and is the only offering in the midsize lot that can be had for under ?150.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw the 7-inch Nook HD tablet as one of our compact tablet offerings because of its great price, and now here we see the larger 9-inch Nook HD+ for the same reason. The HD+ offers the same dual-core TI OMAP 4470 processor as the Nook HD, except it's clocked higher at 1.5GHz. Screen resolution for the larger display is also bumped up to the respectable 1920 x 1280 pixels (that's more than FullHD on a 9-inch screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same compromises with performance and availability apply though. The Nook's TI OMAP 4470 processor is a rather dated option that's not going to impress anyone in terms of performance even at 1.5GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nook HD+ is only officially available in the US and the UK and since last Christmas it's only the 32GB version that remains available in the US. Rumor is Barnes &amp; Noble is clearing inventory prior to a release of an updated Nook family, so you better act quickly if you'd like to secure one as a new model could be announced at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All Nook tablets come with a custom Nook UI, which is quite far from a true Android experience, although it does offer access to the Play Store and its large app selection. If you know your way around flashing a custom ROM, you can enjoy an official CyanogenMod ROM on the Nook HD+ tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer's latest Iconia tablet offers quite a compelling package at a very competitive price point. For less than ?200, the Acer Iconia A1-830 gives you a iPad mini-esque 4:3 aspect ratio, although at just 768 x 1024 pixels resolution it's far from Retina quality. The 4:3 aspect ratio though provides more effective screen estate for reading and web browsing than 16:9 tablets of the same diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera is also touted to be one of the more impressive from a midsize tablet, and while the 1.6GHz Intel Atom Z2560 processor is only of the dual-core variant, it's no slouch when it comes to performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Iconia A1-830 has a metal back and a great overall build quality. It also has a GPS chip, which few of the low cost tablets have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer haven't gotten around making a 3G or LTE version, so if you need a telephony-capable compact tablet, keep reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 8 is one of the most affordable 8-inch tablets to offer 3G connectivity. Its quad-core 1.2GHz Mediatek processor isn't the best around, but it does have a decent 1280 x 800 pixel screen resolution. Plus, its built-in 3-stage kickstand, 6,000 mAh battery and the stereo speakers make it a great media player. It also has a GPS chip on-board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga Tablet 8's telephony-capable variant runs for about ?60 more than the Wi-Fi-only model. It does, however, have fairly limited 3G network connectivity (it supports only two HSDPA bands - 900/2100Mhz), so be sure it has the right coverage for your area if you decide to get one. That said, those should be enough to get you connected to just about any carrier in Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG released its G Pad 8.3 late last year and it's a gorgeous piece of tech. The LG G Pad 8.3 has also had a healthy drop in price, which helps keep it competitive with Samsung's recently-refreshed Tab series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featuring a gorgeous 1200 x 1920 pixel 8.3-inch display (that's more than FullHD), it runs on a quad-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600 chipset with Adreno 320 GPU and 2GB of RAM, so you'll have no problems with gaming and multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 4,600 mAh battery and IR-port for some multifunctional living room use, plus LG have even thrown in 1080p video and HDR support for its 5MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a built-in GPS chip to give this one an edge over the Wi-Fi-only iPad mini, which is probably the only tablet in this class that can match it (and perhaps even beat it) in terms of looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's only a 16GB model available, so you should factor in the cost of a microSD card with your purchase as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 makes our list here thanks in large part to its extensive LTE support. The 8-inch tablet otherwise has low screen resolution of 800 x 1280 and gets beat out by the LG G Pad 8.3 in terms of performance as well, but the G Pad has to make do with just Wi-Fi support (outside the Verizon's US network).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 8.0 also has a wide array of connectivity extras, including an IR-port and USB Host support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, Samsung's excellent pressure-sensitive S-Pen is perfect for jotting things down or doodling away and there's hardly a tablet out there that can match it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP's updated Slate series of tablets has more variants than you can shake a stick at, with varying availability across different markets. The HP Slate8 Pro is perhaps the most popular, and enters our guide thanks in large part to its 8-inch diagonal with a resolution of 1200 x 1600 px. The IPS LCD screen is covered by Gorilla Glass 3 for protection, which is always a good thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has an 8MP camera and there is also a microSD slot. It hardly stands a chance against the LG G Pad 8.3 in Europe where it has pretty much the same price tag, but in the US it actually sells for a lower price so it might as well be considered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP also offers in the States its prepaid DataPass mobile data service, which is sometimes bundled along with their tablets. It gives users 250MB worth of wireless data traffic per month for a period of 2 years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung recently released its premium mid-size tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, and we're happy to report that it has benefitted from a very healthy price drop to make it much more competitive with other top mid-size tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was able to beat out the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 thanks to its slew of software extras and connectivity features, including a microSD card slot for expansion. Besides that, it offers 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution and a Snapdragon 800 processor, the combination of which probably makes it the fastest and meanest mid-size tablet there is. The 8MP camera with 1080p video recording complete the landmark features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It not only comes with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat) but Samsung has also baked a spanking new tablet interface of their own, which truly elevates the tablet user experience to a whole new level (the split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res screen tablets).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to tablets, no self-respecting tablet guide can go without mentioning Apple's. The latest Apple iPad mini 2 (with Retina screen) in Apple's popular iPad lineup boasts a 1536 x 2048 7.9-inch display with a 4:3 aspect ratio. The 4:3 aspect ratio provides more effective screen estate for reading and web browsing than 16:9 tablets. Thanks to Apple's extensive app store, there's no shortage of very functional and polished apps and games for even the most demanding of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 does not come with a microSD card slot, so we'd recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup. The LTE-enabled version offers an immensely wide LTE band support, and also has the benefit of a built-in GPS chip - something which the Wi-Fi only version lacks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-size tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you must have the best, full-size tablets is where it's at. With 10-inch and higher display sizes, you'll have plenty of screen estate for enjoying multimedia content. If you're going this big, then display fidelity plays a much bigger part, so we'll only be listing tablets with eye-popping pixel density in our full-size recommendations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll also be sure to mention models that include 3G/LTE connectivity, as large or not, sometimes you just want to take your tablet out without having to constantly bounce from one Wi-Fi network to the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo's Yoga Tablet 10 comes first as both the most affordable decent 10-inch Wi-Fi-only tablet currently available, and the cheapest tablet that offers 3G connectivity (with the 3G model).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although its 1280 x 800 pixel resolution stretches seriously thin on such a large display, at least it's an IPS LCD unit that offers great viewing angles. Otherwise, the quad-core 1.2GHz processor of the Tablet 10 has little trouble pumping out all the pixels to the screen and it feels snappy (though probably not lightning fast).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the trademark built-in 3-stage kickstand, a 9,000mAh battery and dual front stereo speakers with Dolby Digital Plus for multimedia viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga Tablet 10 does have fairly limited 3G network connectivity (it supports only HSDPA bands 900/2100), so be sure it has the right coverage for your area if you decide to get one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo recently announced their Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10+, which brings up the resolution to 1920x1200 pixels and has a better processor, but it's yet to be released.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 97b Platinum HD again makes our list thanks to its a very respectable 2048 x 1536px screen, which is the same diagonal and aspect ratio of the new Apple iPad Air. It also has a premium all-metal back, alongside a quad-core processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside, you'll find a decent 1.6GHz quad-core Rockchip RK3188 (Cortex-A9) processor and 2GB of RAM. Performance-wise, this chipset puts out 17251 at AnTuTu, so it's in roughly the same ballpark as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Google Nexus 4, both of which however have to cater for less than a third of the Archos 97b Platinum HD number of screen pixels. Performance is not amazing, but it gets the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with other Archos tablets, you'll still have to pay for a microSD card to build on the very limited 8GB of internal memory. But you'll have more than enough money left over, as the 97b Platinum is still more affordable than most competitors' 8-inch offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 97b Platinum HD has a few identical twins by more marginal manufacturers. Some of those tablets may appeal to people who are looking for a decent tablet at bargain basement prices. For instance, the QiLive 97r is a commissioned Archos 97b Platinum HD rebrand for certain sellers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the German only brands Odys (their Odys Iron tablet), Captiva (their Captiva Pad 9.7 Super FHD and Captiva Pad 10.1 Quad FHD tablets), Xoro and Blaupunkt (their Endeavour 1010 tablet). There is also the Chinese Onda V972 tablet, which is an identical twin of the Blaupunkt Endeavour 1010. These have pretty close specs to the Archos tablet with slightly different external design. Unfortunately, none of these tablet makers (or rather sellers) can be considered major per se, so getting into details about those would be crossing a line we promised we wouldn't cross for this tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus makes it onto our list thanks to its affordable yet capable Memo Pad FHD10 tablet. At 1920 x 1200 pixels, the 10-inch IPS LCD display provides great sharpness and wide viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Atom Z2560 processor isn't the fastest out there, the 2GB of RAM should help take some of the pressure off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides white for the back panel, the Asus Memo Pad FHD10 also comes in some interesting color options like Royal Blue and Vivid Pink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's Nexus 10 offering by Samsung is now almost two-year old, but has aged well thanks to its dual-core 1.7GHz Exynos 5250 chipset and excellent 2560 x 1600 pixel Super PLS TFT display. The resulting pixel density is just under 300 ppi. That and the 1080p video recording, Android 4.4 KitKat, and ample 9,000 mAh battery make it a very compelling value at a price that continues to fall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there is no microSD card slot, so we recommend you go for the 32GB version. The 32GB version will run you about the same price as the Memo Pad FHD10 with a 32GB memory card, so choosing either of them is really about choosing your priorities: more than 32GB storage vs. a higher-res screen, or a bigger battery and timely Android updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rumor is Google will finally present the successor of the Nexus 10 this summer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia Tablet Z is one of the most stylish tablet offerings you'll see at this or any other size, with is dual-glass panel design and ultra-slim 6.9mm waistline. Under the hood there's a 1.5GHz Snapdragon processor with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU, and its Android 4.4 KitKat update is already seeding as we speak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively small 6,000mAh battery is the only real downside, as you may not get much time between charges, but battery life is still passable. Thanks to the launch of its successor, the Xperia Z2 Tablet, the Tablet Z has dropped in price considerably and is now worthy of your consideration as it costs about the same as the Nexus 10 mentioned above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recent release of Samsung's Pro range of tablets marked the first time when Samsung released tablets that are priced as high as or even higher than the iPad range. Since then prices of the tablets have come down considerably, and the robust devices are that much more recommendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 offers a beautiful screen that has higher resolution than the iPad Air, alongside a micro SD slot, 8MP camera, and a capable octa-core chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It not only comes with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat), but Samsung has also baked in a spanking new tablet interface of their own, which truly elevates the tablet user experience to a whole new level (the split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res large-screen tablets).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rather uncharacteristically, the Apple iPad Air is not the most expensive tablet in this section. Recent competitive offerings from Samsung have forced the iPad Air to come down slightly in price, although you're still looking at quite a pretty penny for the iPad models with more internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, you still get an ultra-sharp display alongside Apple's proprietary A7 chipset. The iPad Air features a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is arguably the more user-friendly aspect for web browsing or reading and also offers more screen real estate for the same diagonal. Thanks to Apple's extensive app store, there's no shortage of functional and innovative apps and games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air does not come with a microSD card slot, so we recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE-enabled version offers an immensely wide LTE band support, and also has the benefit of having a built-in GPS chip, something which the Wi-Fi only version lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 brings an incredibly sharp 2560 x 1600 pixel display, 3GB of RAM, and quad-core Snapdragon 800 to the table. Samsung's great pressure-sensitive S-Pen offers something other tablets simply can't match. The pleasant leather-like textured plastic back from the Note 3 has also made its way to its elder sibling and it works great visually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE version also bumps up the performance by upping the clock speed to 2.3GHz, and also features Adreno 330 graphics and 1080p@60fps video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're big on typing, then Asus has you covered with its latest Transformer Pad TF701T. Basically a MeMo Pad on steroids, the TF701T comes with an ultra-crisp 2560 x 1600 pixel screen, a hefty quad-core 1.9 GHz Tegra 4 processor, and 32GB of expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly, the Transformer earns its moniker by being the only tablet that also comes with a keyboard dock as part of the retail package, making it a great deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not too long ago that Sony announced their next gen tablet, dubbed the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet. It has a faster Snapdragon 801 chipset and an 8MP back camera with improved Exmor RS sensor, but also does away with the stylish dual-glass panel design that made its predecessor so attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, Sony have improved on the Tablet Z in almost every regard, including improved water resistance - this time it would gladly take a dip in the kiddie pool for up to 30 minutes. There is also the latest Android 4.4 KitKat on board right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were a bit anxious about the lower battery times rating but our own review tests proved that the Xperia Z2 Tablet provides up to 80% longer web browsing and video playback times on a single charge than the original Xperia Tablet Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still largely cost-prohibitive are the two largest members of Samsung's new Pro tablet family. There is the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 or the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, if you are after Samsung's exclusive pressure-sensitive stylus functionality. Other than that, there is not that much difference between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have 12.2-inch screens with 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution, a minimum of 32GB of built-in storage plus a card slot, octa-core chipsets and 8MP cameras with 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, those come come with the latest Android OS v4.4 (KitKat) coupled with Samsung's home-baked goodies that bring a huge boost to productivy. The split-screen multi-tasking view is well overdue on high-res screen tablets and it's brilliantly implemented here, allowing to run up to four apps side by side plus even more in the form of floating windows.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this edition of our tablet buyer's guide we finally saw Samsung regain its positions in the midrange as much as in the high-end. Samsung's Tab 4 tablets are finally worthy of recommendation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinnacle of Samsung's tablet evolution - the Pro range, on the other hand, has seen a healthy price drop, so its members are more affordable now. For instance, since the last edition of this guide in March 2014, the mid-sized Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 was made irrelevant by the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 due to its price drop to more reasonable levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may have noticed we are no longer recommending Windows RT tablets. The reason behind that is that the Windows RT platform has been made irrelevant by the relatively low number of available apps, the pressing competition from fast and capable Android tablets plus the influx of new tablets, running the proper version of Windows on Intel's new Bay Trail architecture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without undermining the importance of these full Windows tablets, we've deliberately left them out of this article. These tablets generally are outside of our main expertise as they are pretty much straightforward Windows computers. Their low price points however allow them to inevitably come up in the conversation whenever tablet purchase is considered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more notable products on the market of this sort include the mid-sized Toshiba Encore 8, the Lenovo Miix 2 8, and the Dell Venue 8 Pro. All three of them have 1.86GHz Intel Atom Z3740 chipsets with Intel HD graphics, 2GB of RAM, 1280 x 800px screens, front and rear cams and run fully-fledged Windows 8.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the 10-inchers most notable are probably the 10.1-inch Asus Transformer Book T100 and the HP Omni 10. The Asus Transformer Book T100 comes with a detachable keyboard dock, which can even host an optional 500GB HDD. The Asus tablet however lacks a camera on the back and the otherwise good 10-inch screen has a resolution of only 1366 x 768 pixels. The HP Omni 10 on the other hand has cameras on both front and back and has a FullHD resolution screen and it's a bit cheaper, though it lacks a keyboard dock. Both of these have excellent real-life battery life of up to 10 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When choosing one of these newfangled Windows tablets, bear in mind that their cheaper 32GB versions already have most of the storage taken up by the system files, so there is hardly any room for installing additional applications (hardly more than 12GB of user-available storage). The microSD slot is great for storing your multimedia files, but not so good for apps, so 64GB storage is probably the minimum you should be looking at there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A noteworthy new addition to these Windows tablets is Microsoft's own Surface Pro 3, a 12-incher with a resolution of 2160 x 1440px. Just over 9mm thin, it weighs only 800g and has a built-in multi-angle kickstand. This one really stands out, as unlike the other Atom-based tablets, it's powered by Core i3, Core i5 and even Core i7 processors. The Surface Pro 3 is now available for pre-order in 22 countries worldwide (launch in August), but it doesn't come cheap. The cheapest option will set you back $800 or ?640 (the keyboard case not included). We'll know whether the Surface Pro 3 is actually worth it, only when it becomes available later this summer.</paragraph>
