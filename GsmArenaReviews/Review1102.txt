			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III and the Note II are both cut from the same cloth, but one is XL while the other is XXL. What can we say - someone at Samsung must be busy spinning and weaving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size matters as it always has but this isn't a choice between slim fit and loose fit. It's the Android experience and it must be the perfect fit - so another close-up look at both may be well worth it. And mind you, this isn't about which one is better - the phone or the phablet - it's about which one looks good on you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard not to look at the Note II as an oversized Galaxy S III, but a few minutes with the S Pen might convince you otherwise. The bigger screen (with a new Super AMOLED matrix to boot) and overclocked chipset are pretty sweet too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, 4.8" is plenty for a phone and the S III is a root away from the extra clock speed if you're a power-obsessed geek. Plus, while the screen uses a PenTile Super AMOLED matrix, it does handle sunlight better. And styli went out of fashion years ago, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're about to delve into the details, but if we had 10 seconds to summarize the differences between the S III and Note II, here's what we'd tell you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note II over S III<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While mobile devices are typically good at content consumption but not creation, Samsung is trying to break that barrier with the S Pen. The split-screen interface also promises improved productivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Galaxy S III is lighter on the pocket (in both the physical and monetary sense) and is pretty much the same device in terms of software and hardware (sans the S Pen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the roadmap for this comparison - we start off with the hardware, including the screen and battery life, then we move on to software and benchmarks, compare the cameras and finish off with the audio quality. Press next to begin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>General hardware comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II use virtually the same design and same hyperglazed plastic exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They do differ in size as we've already mentioned - the Galaxy S III measures 136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6 mm, while the Note II is bigger in every direction at 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm. Thickness is a non-issue (unless it's bragging rights you're after, in which case you lose to plenty of other phones), though the height does raise questions about the pocketability of the Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the biggest issue is width - at 80.5mm, the Note II is the widest phone (well, okay, phablet), save for the LG Optimus Vu. This limits the comfort of one hand operation, compared to the S III. Still, it's 2.5mm narrower than the original Note, despite the bigger screen (that's thanks to the switch from a 16:10 to a 16:9 aspect ratio).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight is also a consideration. The Galaxy S III weighs the norm for its generation of flagships at 133g (the HTC One X is 130g and the LG Optimus 4X HD is 133g). The Galaxy Note II weighs 183g, which sounds like a lot (and it is) but it's well distributed (it's not top heavy or anything) and you have to remember that the Nokia Lumia 920 phone weighs 185g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another difference, is the Galaxy S III has a wider selection of colors, though we fully expect the Note II to catch up in time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, both devices have a removable back cover and a user-replaceable battery. The Galaxy S III has a respectable 2100mAh Li-Ion battery, while the bigger Note II has a 3100mAh unit. After we examine the screen, we'll talk about battery life in a separate chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite their size, both devices use microSIMs only though on the upside they both have microSD card slots to expand the built-in memory (both are available in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are minor differences, like the hardware Home button on the front and the loudspeaker on the back, though we don't think any of the devices is at a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything else - button and port positioning - is the same with the exception of the added S Pen slot on the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battle of the large 720p Super AMOLEDs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have two Super AMOLED screens of 720p resolution facing off, one 4.8" big and the other 5.5". In terms of surface area, the Samsung Galaxy Note II has a 30% bigger screen than the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both use Gorilla Glass 2 for protection, but the matrices below are different for the two devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one on the Galaxy S III is PenTile with two sub-pixels per pixel, while the one of the Galaxy Note II has a full set of sub-pixels in every pixel in an unusual arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while the pixel density of the S III is 306ppi over the 267ppi density of the Note II, the less dense screen actually appears sharper. Not that the S III display isn't sharp - the high pixel density does a good job of hiding the cross-hatch look typical of PenTile screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note II's screen has a further advantage - it's brighter. At maximum it puts out 402 nits, a significant increase over the 330 nits of the Galaxy S III. Both screens have perfectly deep blacks and theoretically infinite contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life conditions, however, the Samsung Galaxy S III holds its own - its sunlight legibility is among the best we've seen, while that of the Note II is average. We guess that extra layer for the Wacom digitizer is to blame here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles on AMOLED displays are typically excellent and both Galaxy phones are no exception. Still, there's a slight color shift visible on the S III (a blue/green tint) while the effect is less prominent on the Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life endurance race<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II both use virtually the same chipset, though the one in the Note II is clocked higher. There is a tangible difference in screen sizes too, the bigger 5.5" Super AMOLED screen is more energy-intensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make up for it, the Note II has nearly 50% more juice in its 3100mAh battery than the Galaxy S III and its 2100mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen doesn't come into play in the first test - the call test - and neither does the faster clock speed. The Note II can last nearly 17 hours of talks on a 3G network, which is considerably more than the 10 hours 20 minutes that the S III scores (updating it to Jelly Bean doesn't help).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's 65% better, more than the difference in battery capacities, so we might be seeing a more efficient modem or antenna on the Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II maintains its lead in the web browsing test, with an advantage of just over two hours over a Jelly Bean-running Galaxy S III. If the S III is running Ice Cream Sandwich the gap is even bigger - three and a half hours. Running the newer Android release has clear advantages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In some cases, anyway. When it comes to playing videos, the Galaxy S III manages 10 hours on Ice Cream Sandwich and half an hour less on Jelly Bean. The Note II beats it either way, though with the narrowest margin of the three tests, an hour and a half/two hours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, a Samsung Galaxy S III will be good for two days of usage during which you can do an hour of talking on a 3G network, browse the web for an hour and watch an hour of video each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II will last nearly a day longer with a similar load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While both devices have good battery life readings, really heavy users will be better off with the Note II, especially if they do a lot of calling. The Note II also offers more comfortable reading of web pages and a better viewing experience with its bigger screen too. And since we run tests with the screen set at 50%, the Note II's screen was brighter during the tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Similar user interfaces are not quite the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the user interface on the Samsung Galaxy S III and Note II, they use virtually the same software - Android Jelly Bean with the latest TouchWiz. The biggest extras that the Note II has really are down to the S Pen features and the newly announced split-screen interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are videos of both devices in action, see if you can spot the differences (there are a few more).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Did you see it? The app launched on the Note II has a 5x5 grid of icons, while the S III fits only a 4x5 grid. Oddly, that doesn't apply to the homescreen, both devices fit 4 icons on a row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets on the homescreen move out of the way as you reorder them and some are resizable, standard Jelly Bean stuff. The notification area has been expanded to hold 10 toggles (5 on screen, another five a swipe away), a brightness slider and, of course, the new expandable notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note II has what Samsung calls Page Buddy - dedicated homescreen panes that become visible only in certain events. There's one for when you pull out the S Pen, one for plugging in headphones, one for docks and one for roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can put any widget you find helpful here (e.g. S Note for the S Pen, music player controls for the headphones, data counter for the roaming screen and so on). The shortcut dock at the bottom of the screen also changes to show a selection of related shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung introduced S Voice with TouchWiz for Ice Cream Sandwich, which can be used for voice commands (dial a contact, ask for directions, turn Wi-Fi on, etc.) and asking questions. S Voice can also be activated by a voice prompt (e.g. "Hi Galaxy") instead of pressing a button. The only change between S Voice on the S III and Note II is that you can use the S Pen to hand-write the query (good for noisy environments, bad for long queries).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Jelly Bean, Google introduced Google Now and linked their Knowledge Engine, so you can ask it questions too. It support some voice commands as well, but fewer than S Voice. A great option here is that Speech To Text works offline so you can dictate an SMS even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy S III and Note II you don't have to choose between S Voice and Google's solution - the first one you get when you double tap the Home key, the other by long pressing the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices feature clever tricks that try to make your life easier. Smart Alerts, for example, will make the phone vibrate upon pick-up if there are any missed events. Smart stay uses the front-facing camera to check whether you're looking at the screen and if you are, it won't lock it (which is great for long reading).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Galaxy Note II has as an extra feature is Smart rotation - just like Smart stay it looks at your face, but this time it's to check how it should rotate the screen as the accelerometer isn't always right (e.g. reading in landscape as you're lying on your side).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another is Quick glance - when you wave your hand over the phone it will display a clock and counters for missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While those features aren't currently available on the Galaxy S III, it should be pretty easy to port them - for either Samsung's dev team or your friendly neighborhood modder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two things that we definitely won't see come officially to the S III are the S Pen features and the split-screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Pen has a number of functions beyond drawing - by the way, it can recognize 1024 levels of pressure and can be detected at a distance. The latter is called Air View and can be used to preview anything from email bodies, S Planner events, folders with images and peek at videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Pen gestures can be used to open the context menu, go back or do something more complicated - do a web search, dial a phone, send a message and anything else you can think of, thanks to the hand customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The split screen is different to what we've seen in the Gallery or Email apps. It runs two apps side by side, similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. You can, for example, have the browser running on one side and the Gmail client next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all apps can work in split-screen, but the list is pretty long - longer than what the big Note has. Here's what works at the moment: Android Browser, Chrome, Maps, Messaging, Gmail, Gtalk, Twitter, S Note, Gallery, Videos and YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can adjust the splitting line to give an app more or less space and there's a swap button too. Apps automatically switch between portrait and landscape mode as you turn the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The split-screen feature isn't available on all Galaxy Note IIs just yet, but the update is rolling out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III and Note II are both based on the Exynos 4412 Quad chipset, but in the Note II it has been slightly overclocked. Inside the chipset are four Cortex-A9 cores (running at 1.4GHz in the S III and 1.6GHz in the Note II), 1GB or 2GB of RAM and Mali-400MP GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III situation is a little confusing - the international version of the S III has 1GB, while the LTE and US versions have 2GB. The US version is based on a different chipset too - a dual-core Snapdragon. We're reviewing the international S III, meaning Exynos with 1GB of RAM. It's running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean (which posted lower scores in some tests than ICS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortex-A9 isn't the newest ARM design in town, but it holds its own in single-threaded performance. Due to the clock speed, we expect to see a 15% advantage for the Note II, which is pretty much what we're seeing in Benchmark Pi. The Krait-packing LG Optimus G has a slight lead, but not by much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack shows good performance for a quad-core A9, but it's way behind the four Kraits in this test. Still, the Exynos chipsets do beat the other popular quad A9 design, the Tegra 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 rates both Galaxy droids on top (over even the Optimus G). AnTuTu and Quadrant both give close scores to the S III and Note II, with an advantage for the faster CPU (of course).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU is a Mali-400, which Samsung used in the Galaxy S II and the original Note, but the one in the S III and Note II is a more powerful version. It holds up surprisingly well against the brand new Adreno 320 and easily beats the ULP GeForce GPU of the Tegra 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the GPU is hitting the 60fps limitation of the screens when running NenaMark 2, we stuck with GLBenchmark. When rendering at 720p resolution, both GPUs are very close and not far from the Adreno 320. The lead on the Tegra 3 chipsets is around 50%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ramped up to 1080p resolution however, things change - the new Adreno pulls ahead (followed closely by the triple-core SGX543 GPU in the Apple iPhone 5), while the Galaxy S III and Note II are still close together, but render at nearly half the framerate.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Now for web browsing - both Galaxy droids are running Jelly Bean, which brought major speed improvements in this area. The Galaxy Note II is the fastest droid we've tested on SunSpider, just behind the iPhone 5. The Galaxy S III didn't break the 1000ms barrier, but is still quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In BrowserMark, the Note II is again the fastest droid phone we've tested and very close to the iPhone 5. The Galaxy S III is behind but manages to fend off other droids (with the exception of the Meizu MX 4-core, which shares its chipset with the Samsung phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Note II posts an impressive Vellamo score, while the Galaxy S III lags behind its bigger brother and also gives way to the HTC One X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II and Galaxy S III both use an 8MP camera with LED flash and 1080p video recording. The set of features is almost the same, except the Note II adds Best faces (it snaps 5 shots and assembles one final photo out of them, letting you pick which facial expression to use for each person in the photo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, both cameras have nice, customizable UIs and features like HDR, Panorama, Burst shot, touch focus and snapping 6MP photos while recording 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But what about image quality? Well, the difference here is even slimmer. Let's have a look at a few crops of our standard charts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III and Note II results at the synthetic resolution chart are too close to call in terms of both horizontal and vertical resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over at the second chart, some differences start to appear - the Galaxy S III photo looks slightly sharper in the gravel and grass areas and the white noise patch. The borders between the color squares also look sharper, this could be due to a differently tuned sharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third chart might as well have been shot with the same device, the only differences seem to stem from slight changes in the lighting more than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Note II record 1080p@30fps video and the results in our Ferris wheel setup look very much the same in terms of resolved detail. There is a difference in color processing though, the S III pushed the contrast up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In poorer lighting, things remain the same - same amount of detail, though the Note II video is a bit darker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the synthetic resolution chart shot on video looks the same with both devices with the persistent exception of slightly differing brightness/exposure settings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality evenly matched<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III and the Samsung Galaxy Note II audio output is so similar that we are convinced the two share the same hardware. The scores of the duo are virtually identical in both cases of our test, with the Note II having so subtle advantage that it's impossible to detect with a naked ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter which one you choose, you will be enjoying some of the industry's cleanest output and about average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II both scored Good marks in our loudspeaker test. The two speakers aren't tuned the same way though, the S III is louder when it comes to voice, while the Note II does better with ringtones. Their loudness is identical when it comes to music.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having reviewed both the Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II, and looking at them up close again for this article, it's still hard to pick a favorite. The Note II certainly offers more in a lot of areas we've tested but the user experience isn't dramatically different from what a Galaxy S III offers. So is it worth the extra weight in your pockets and the higher price tag?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess it's down to what you plan on using the gadget for - the Galaxy S III feels like more of an all-in-one device. It's an excellent phone for calls, for using outdoors, for shooting photos and with a 4.8" 720p Super AMOLED display it does a great job at browsing the web or playing movies. In short, it's a great balance between portability and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II trades away some phone functions (not the least of which are portability and sunlight legibility) and lets the tablet side of its phablet personality come forward - a screen that's even better suited for multimedia consumption, gaming and, with features like S Pen and the split-screen UI, a higher productivity potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Go have a look through your wardrobe to see if you can find a place for the Galaxy Note II (probably not a pants pocket - a backpack maybe?) and you can do your math while at it. The Galaxy S III costs less, but the extra screen estate alone is worth the difference if you really feel the need for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end it's not about whether the S Pen and the Split Screen are worth the higher asking price. They may as well be. More importantly though, they are exactly the kind of features that can make an owner of a sparkly Galaxy S III admit to a tinge of regret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Others may be cool about it. We'll say it again, size matters. In this case we suggest you get as big a device as you can handle, but no bigger. If the Note II can fit in your hand, than it will waltz straight into your heart. Otherwise, the Galaxy S III is the only way way to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III hit 20 million sales in 100 days and Samsung projects 20 million sales of the Note II (which understandably is a lower-volume item). So, whichever one you pick, you'll be in good company.</paragraph>
