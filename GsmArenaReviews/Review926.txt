			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo is slowly starting to make a name for itself in the West with its high-end phones, and the company is now more ambitious than ever ? today's Oppo N1 promises an impressive camera that takes on the likes of the Xperia Z1 and Lumia 1020. With the N1, Oppo has worked closely with the popular CyanogenMod custom Android ROM team, to make the software side of things highly customizable, and really raise its profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back even to the previous generation, the company puts a strong focus on design. "Beauty above everything else," made the Find 5 definitely a looker. The Oppo N1 has a more rounded design than that, with the company calling it "Restricted art." It's also quite a bit bigger; firmly in phablet territory with a 5.9" screen of 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will run Oppo's so-called Color OS, which is a heavily skinned Android. The company claims it took 43 patents and plenty of user case studies to get Color OS where it is today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo is aiming high with the N1 saying the iPhone brought "Touch 1.0," but Oppo is introducing "Touch 2.0" with innovations like O-Touch. It's a touch-sensitive control on the back that enables scrolling gestures, touch to record audio, and so on. An API will become available to game developers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most impressive features on the Oppo N1 is actually an old one ? the camera can be rotated to point towards the front as well as the back. We haven?t seen such a design in quite a while. The camera has 13MP resolution, a dual-LED flash and a custom ISP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This part has proven to be very complex - there are as many as 67 parts in it and Oppo has calculated the gaps so that it can rotate 206° with smooth resistance the whole way through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo also announced the O-Click remote control ? it doesn?t submit to the smartwatch craze, instead it uses the remote to snap photos from a distance, it buzzes when you get a new message and will alert you if you get separated from the phone. O-Click is a keychain too and you can use the phone to find your keys ? this is the best thing since sliced bread.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Oppo N1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We got a chance to unbox the Oppo N1 on the spot - it's packed in a flat box that contains the charger, a microUSB cable, a one-piece headset (in-ear design) and the O-Click remote (this was a nice surprise). They are all bundled in separate little boxes, making the packaging look quite premium.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo N1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 is a phablet with a 5.9" screen, so it's not small by any means. Nevertheless, it's a complementary partner to the Find 5 like Samsung's Notes are to the Galaxy S phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen's large diagonal is offset by 1080p resolution, so the pixel density is still fairly high at 373ppi. Oppo is advertising the screen brightness at 450 nits, not all that much for an IPS LCD like the N1's. In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S4 screen is at around 400 nits and it's an AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the screen looks pretty bright but it's a dark room here. Side viewing angles are excellent, it's a high-quality screen, no doubt about that. It works with gloves - there's a high-sensitivity mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen's digitizer is super-sensitive and can be used with gloves (good for cold climates).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is crafted from aluminum in 14 arduous steps that take 20 days to complete. The back has been treated to have a soft touch finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is fairly large too, measuring 170.7 x 82.6 x 9mm and weighing 213g. For comparison a Galaxy Mega 6.3 measures 167.7 x 88 x 8mm and weighs 199g and that's with a bigger 6.3" screen. On the up side, the N1 packs a generous 3,610mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most curious features of the Oppo N1 (besides the rotating camera) is O-Touch. That's a 40 x 30mm touch-sensitive area on the back of the phone that can be used to control the UI and apps. This really helps one-handed use as it gives you a handy shortcut for some things and you don't have to reach across the large screen, plus that way you don't cover the content on the screen with your fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchpad on the back is a small patch and you can actually see its borders from a certain angle - they are like printed on the back cover. (some Pantech VEGA phones have a touchpad on the back so it's not exclusive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are lots of gestures, for instance you can start the camera from pretty much any screen just by pinching with all three fingers. These multi-finger gestures are built-in and work throughout the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also custom DRAWING gestures - for those you need to slide the launchpad open. It's accessible with a slide from the top - its icon is the leftmost in the upper left corner. The launchpad is more like a drawpad where you can draw a gesture with your fingers and it would activate an app of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side of the Oppo N1 there is a power key and a volume key. These are pretty inconspicuous but they are there. The left side houses the microSIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom there is the speaker, microUSB with USB OTG support and 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 is powered by a Snapdragon 600 APQ8064 chipset with four Krait 300 CPU cores clocked at 1.7GHz, 2GB RAM and an Adreno 320 GPU. There will be two versions in terms of storage, 16GB and 32GB, but there's no microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Color OS is more like a skin on top, not really an OS of its own. There is the full set of the Google services. Not the Chinese version though. The Chinese version they are selling it on China Unicom and China Mobile. No international carriers yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the international version they have plans of releasing it with an Easy Recovery that would allow flashing CyanogenMod. They are even thinking of supplying the CyanogenMod ROM files straight with the device. They are also thinking of making an exclusive CyanogenMod version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 features NFC connectivity and the company has partnered with two systems in China to provide wireless payment services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with Wi-Fi Direct and Wi-Fi Display, Bluetooth 4.0 LE and GPS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo N1 camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Oppo N1 is its most impressive feature and Oppo has put a lot of work implementing their own additions so that the N1 can compete with other Android camera phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a 1/3.06" CMOS sensor with 13MP resolution. The lens has a bright F/2.0 aperture and 6 lenses - Oppo says this is the first Android camera with a 6-lens design. More importantly it matches the Nokia Lumia 1020, which also has a 6-element lens - it has the recognizable ZEISS brand name, but its aperture is F/2.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another point where Oppo claims superiority is the long exposure - up to 8 seconds (the 1020 does only 4 seconds) - and fast camera startup, which only takes 0.6 seconds to launch. Turning the camera assembly around automatically launches the camera app too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, turning the camera - you can point it back, forward or just about anywhere in a 206° arc. The camera is really easy to rotate but still with just enough resistance. Turning it half the way (120 degrees) automatically starts the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a highly complex component with some 50 cables going in and out, which would sound fragile to anyone old enough to remember the numerous faulty ribbon cables in slider and clamshell phones, but the company claims it has put it through tough tests and says it should withstand some 100,000 rotations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 uses a custom image processor co-developed by Oppo and Fujitsu. Oppo is promising it has solved common camera problems like pink spots and purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two flashes - one is a bright LED for regular shots (when the camera is pointed back), but when you turn the camera beyond a certain angle, the phone uses automatically the diffused one so your selfies turn out with a more pleasing skin tone. Self-portraits seem to be a big thing in Asia, according to their research.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app itself has been updated and does the skin and eye whitening and Beauty Plus effects we saw on the Oppo Find 5, only this time in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped several camera samples with the Oppo N1, but unfortunately the long tradition of poor lighting at such venues continues and we can't say much about the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering how dark it is in the room (and it's quite dark), the Oppo N1 did pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took a long exposure photo, but that one lasted only 0.9 seconds. That's nowhere near the 8 second maximum that the Oppo N1 can do, but this shot was too bright for a longer exposure (the street lights were quite bright). Still, we got that cool light streak effect from a car's lights so we think it turned out pretty well. You would need almost complete darkness for an eight second exposure.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>O-Click remote<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The O-Click remote is a sleek-looking keychain, a smart one at that. It connects to the Oppo N1 and will vibrate or ring to alert you of notifications even when you have the phone on silent, it also acts as a remote shutter letting you snap a photo from a distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a case that allows the phone to prop It up and take pictures - long exposure ones (Slow Shutter they call it) and group self-shots when you use the O-Click remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remote has a 50 meter range thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (in practice, it's more like 10-15m). If the remote goes out of range of the phone, it will alert you to go back and pick up your lost phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remote does more than prevent you losing your phone - you can make the phone ring the remote and you can make the remote ring the phone. This way you can have your keys on the remote and the phone will help you find them. Or you could go the other way around and use the remote to help you find your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Best of all, the O-Click remote will come in the Oppo N1 box, so you don't have to purchase it separately.</paragraph>
