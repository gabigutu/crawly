			<subsectionTitle>Acer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Iconia Smart is official at last - though the 4.8" smartphone/tablet is hardly a surprise after several leaks. Acer call it 100% tablet, 100% smartphone and we're not going to disagree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We spent some time with the Liquid mini and the Liquid mt too and we are ready to share our first impressions with you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Iconia Smart<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The mysterious Acer smartphone is finally revealed - meet the Iconia Smart. It's a tablet/smartphone crossbreed built around an impressive 4.8" touchscreen of 1024x480 pixel resolution. Yes, that's 21:9 aspect ratio, the same as the LG BL40 New Chocolate, and should be great for watching some widescreen HD movies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to note about the Iconia Samrt is the full-metal finish which seems quite durable and finger-print proof. Despite its size, the Iconia Smart has good handling - which is mostly attributed to the screen ratio. It's more of a tall phone, rather than a huge slab, and that's quite comfortable for single-handed use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Iconia Smart is based on the Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon platform. It's powered by a 1GHz Scorpion processor and uses the latest Adreno 205 GPU. An 8 megapixel camera is accompanied by a LED flash and 720p video recording is enabled. The Iconia Smart is well-connected with HSPA, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, a 3.5mm audio jack, HDMI and microUSB ports. There is a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera for video calls too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer also put a few status LEDs on top - the same as on the Liquid and the Liquid mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Iconia Smart runs on the latest Android v.2.3.2 Gingerbread, but there is almost nothing left of the original looks. The latest Acer Touch 3D UI 4.2 is all over the stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out a video demo we've prepared for you with the Acer Iconia Smart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid mt<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next device by Acer is actually the Liquid Metal, that has been renamed. All of its specs are long familiar, so enjoy the live photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid mt has the same status LEDs on top as the Iconia Smart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid mt runs Android v2.2 Froyo, with the Acer Touch 3D UI 4.0 on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the only metal thing on the Liquid mt is the battery cover and this might be part of the reason why Acer changed the name.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid mini has also been previously announced. We have some photos of all the available covers that you might want to check out:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Froyo-running Liquid mini comes with Acer Touch 3D UI 4.0 and is expected to hit the shelves in April.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer beTouch E210<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also met the Acer beTouch E210. The Froyo-powered messenger should start shipping next month.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer's smartphones were just the light cavalry. The big hitters followed in the shape of three Iconia tablets: the A100, A500 and W500. As the names suggest, we had the pleasure of two droids (A100, A500) and a Windows 7 powered tablet (W500).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems Acer is lining up to compete on multiple markets. The A100 is a 7" Honeycomb tablet, which will be hoping to beat the Galaxy Tab. Its 10" sibling, the A500, will be fielded against the new Galaxy Tab 10.1. The 10-inch W500 is in the Windows 7 camp.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Iconia Tab A100/A101<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Iconia Tab Acer A100/A101 is a 7" tablet based on the NVIDIA Tegra250 platform and comes with 512MB of RAM. The capacitive display has resolution of 1024x600 pixels and is capable of 5+ point multi-touch (for what it's worth).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a 5 megapixel camera on the back and a 2 megapixel one at the front for video calls. The A100 model is a Wi-Fi only, while the A101 is capable of both Wi-Fi and 3G (no phone calls, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both versions have 8GB of internal storage expandable via a microSD card. They will both run Honeycomb at release (the tablet prototypes we had our hands had only Froyo). You should expect them around April.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Iconia Tab A500/A510<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The A5 series tablets are the 10.1-inch siblings of the A1 ones. The A500/A501 duo is also based on NVDIA Tegra250, but doubles the RAM to 1GB DDR2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 10.1-inch display has higher resolution too - 1024x800 pixels - and is capable of 10-point multi-touch tracking. The imaging capabilities are the same as in the A10x pair, and so is the model breakdown: the A500 is Wi-Fi only, while the A501 is 3G enabled. No phone calls here either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer Iconia Tab A500/A501 will be available with 16 or 32GB of internal storage, but you can build upon it via the microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A500 model will be released in March, while the A501 will come in April.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A501 we tried was also a prototype running on Froyo. The A500 pair has metal casing and that is definitely the approach we prefer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Iconia Tab W500/W501<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Iconia Tab W500/W501 is a Windows 7-powered tablet made of metal. It's based on the AMD C50 platform - a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM and a Radeon HD6250 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Iconia Tab W500 has a 10.1" LCD LED-backlit display of 1280x800 pixels resolution. It also has two cameras and 32GB of SSD storage. The OS ticking inside is Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit and should pack a unique Acer Ring multi-touch interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting feature of the W500/W501 is the keyboard dock. It does exactly what it's supposed to - adds keyboard to the above awesomeness. You can check it out on the pictures below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We poked around Windows 7 and we were impressed with the performance. There were no lags, the gentlest of gestures and touches got immediate response. The multi-touch works like a charm. The unit we tried didn't have the Ring UI, but other than that we've nothing to complain about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Iconia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran across the Acer Iconia dual-touchscreen laptop at the MWC 2011 and photographed the hell out of it. The laptop's claim to fame is two 14" touchscreens, one of which can act as a keyboard or gesture area when needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can also use the two screens to display twice as much info as other 14" laptops. But the real question for us was how well the virtual keyboard performs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the basic specs of the Acer Iconia - two 14" 1366x768 touchscreens with Gorilla Glass scratch-resistant surface, an Intel Core i5 processor, 2x USB 2.0 and 1x USB 3.0, an HDMI port and Windows 7 OS with elaborate touch-operated software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get the Iconia with a i5 560M or i5 580M CPUs too, with up to 8GB of RAM. For storage, you can choose from 320/500/640/750GB HDDs (or larger) but there's no SSD option. There's no alternative to the Intel graphics either. The Iconia weighs 2.8kg, which is quite a bit for a 14-incher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one we tested had a Core i5 480M dual-core CPU (2.66GHz clock speed, 2.93GHz with TurboBoost) with 4GB of RAM. Respectable hardware, but we noticed some lags here and there. The Intel HD Graphics GPU probably didn't help much here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing on the ICONIA is a cool experience - the two screens managed to fit almost all of our homepage vertically. But the bottom screen can do more - you can put widgets on it, which pull info from different sites (check the video to see how those work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom screen is also where you can do gestures and it houses the Acer Ring, a nicely touch-optimized launcher, which can be activated by placing five fingers on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Place both palms on the bottom screen and the virtual keyboard pops up - it's not like other virtual keyboards you're used, this one emulates a laptop keyboard very closely. It's a full QWERTY keyboard, with touchpad and palm rests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typing experience is a bit of a hit and miss. You can start typing fast and accurately right off the bat. If you're having trouble, you can use the spell correction until you get used to typing on a big virtual keyboard with both hands. Handwriting recognition is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's other cool stuff like social networking integration, which displays updates from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube on the second display, touch optimized web browser, media players and more, but that's all we had time to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Iconia is priced at ?1,100 ($1,500).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo of the Acer ICONIA that we shot at the MWC 2011:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The one thing we hate most is happening all too often at the MWC - staff at the booths are short of press kits and can't provide any official information. It may even turn out they know less than the visitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the kind of experience we had at the ZTE and Huawei booths. Both manufacturers had all the latest gadgets lined up but there was little in the way of official specs. At least the girls over at Huawei were kind and helpful in the shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the ZTE.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Skate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Skate is currently ZTE's top smartphone running on the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread and boasting a 4.3-inch capacitive WVGA touchscreen. The device uses an 800MHz processor and the previous generation Adreno 200 graphics. There is also a 5 megapixel snapper with LED flash and a complete connectivity set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Skate uses matte black plastic on the battery cover which is quite fingerprint resistant. The overall build seemed very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no proprietary interface plug-in and the system is quite fast and responsive. The Skate made a good first impression, though we couldn't help but wonder what if ZTE used a newer version of the Snapdragon chipset - something with Adreno 205 or so.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Amigo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Amigo is a compact mid-range messenger running on Android v2.2 Froyo. The QWERTY keyboard bears an uncanny resemblance to the Palm Pre only quite bigger of course. The side-sliding form factor allows it. It's not the best of keyboards we've seen, but will do the job. At least the slider runs firm and solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Amigo uses a rather average 3.2-inch capacitive display of HVGA resolution. The viewing angles and contrast could have definitely been better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing much to say about the UI - a stock version of Android Froyo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Libra<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Libra is the keyboard-less version of the Amigo, but uses a 3.5-inch WVGA capacitive display instead. The rest of the known specs are pretty much the same: a 3 megapixel camera, the usual connectivity package and stock Android Froyo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE U900<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE U900 is a China Mobile smartphone powered by OPhone - a custom Android Eclair build for China Mobile. We won't get into details, here are some live photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE V9+<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE V9+ tablet should be a direct competitor of the Samsung Galaxy Tab. It looks and feels like the Galaxy and is not far off spec-wise either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The V9+ runs on Android v2.2. Froyo and boasts a 1GHz processor, 512MB RAM, 4GB of internal storage and a 5 megapixel camera. V9+ has telephony enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wanted to try the tablet but it obviously was an early sample that didn't behave too well. The one thing we can tell is it runs stock Android too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei is not among the biggest names in the industry, but they have their moments. Their latest additions to the IDEOS lienup are the X3, X5 and the Slim version of the S7 tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei IDEOS X3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The live photos below are of a dummy X3 - Huawei didn't have a working unit to show. At least you can get a glimpse of what's coming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X3 will run on the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread and will pack a 3.2-inch capacitive touchscreen. Another feature we can confirm is thickness: the X3 is 9.9mm slim.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei IDEOS X5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The IDEOS X5 is a recently announced gadget which should hit the shelves this May. It is based on the Snapdragon chipset with an 800MHz processor and the latest Adreno 205 graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X5 has 3.8" WVGA capacitive display which looked very vibrant with rich, vivid colors and decent viewing angles. The rest of the confirmed specs include a 5 megapixel camera capable of 720p video recording and 2 or 4GB of internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IDEOS X5 is based on Android v2.2 Froyo and Huawei tried to give it some personality by putting a simple but unique homescreen heavy on eye-candy. The performance was excellent and we are quite happy with what we saw. If properly priced, the IDEOS X5 can be an excellent choice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei IDEOS S7 Slim<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest Huawei tablet is a slimmer version of the earlier S7. It runs Android v2.2 Froyo, with a really nice proprietary tabbed homescreen with widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, it's just an average tablet. The specs were not disclosed but we guess it's a Snapdragon chipset with a single-core processor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sonim<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We love the next manufacturer for two reasons - it knows how to make a durable phone and its presentations are always incredibly cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sonim is a company dedicated to building phones that have the strength to survive almost any disaster. Sonim XP3300 Force is the latest addition to the company's lineup of survivors and it promises even greater durability than its predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 185-grams Sonim XP3300 Force features a 2-inch QVGA bright display, GPS with A-GPS support, 2 megapixel camera, FM radio, 3.5mm audio jack and microSD card slot. Sonim claims its GPS lock is the fastest in the cellphone world. The XP3300 Force comes with a huge 1750 mAh battery, which should give you 22 hours of talk time (Sonim says that's a world record) or 800 hours in stand-by mode. Quite impressive, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XP3300 Force is MIL-810G certified for salt, fog, humidity and shock resistance (up to 4G). It also meets the IP-68 certification, which means that it can stay submerged in up to 2 meter-deep water for one hour. The XP3300 would survive 2 meter drops on concrete, vibrations from 5 to 500Hz and exposure to extreme temperatures (from -20 to 55 degrees Celsius).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XP3300 Force uses hardened rubber molded to Fiberglass casing. Its display is covered with the shock and scratch resistant Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset comes with a three-year international warranty that covers all kinds of accidental damage. So, barring using a power tool to destroy your phone on purpose, everything is covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we can assure you the XP3300 Force is even more impressive in flesh than it sounds. The guys from Sonim did so many things to the phone, that we lost count in the first half an hour. There were deeply frozen and cemented units that kept ringing all the time, hammering nails test, antifreeze baths and of course - the countless drops on concrete. All the units looked scratch-free and in full working order after four hours of these tortures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you could probably sense we are really impressed with the XP3300 and we're already looking forward to seeing the Sonim announcement next year. And we hope we will get an XP3300 Force unit when it hits the shelves so we can do some more of those torture tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the tradition goes Alcatel showcases several new entry-level handsets at the MWC. Those might not look like much but with the rock-bottom price tags they carry, they do become a pretty decent deal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-803<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One Touch 803 is a compact messenger featuring a 2.4-inch resistive QVGA touchscreen, a 2 megapixel camera, an FM radio, 50MB internal memory and a microSD card slot. The OT-803 runs on a proprietary operating system.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-807<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The OT-807 has the same specs as the 803, except the slightly bigger 2.8-inch display. It has a more mature design, but its QWERTY keys are thinner and somewhat less comfortable than those on the 803.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OT-990<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This fella is the top gadget on the Alcatel booth. It?s a Froyo powered smartphone packing a 3.5-inch capacitive touchscreen, a 600MHz processor, the company?s first 5 megapixel snapper and the typical connectivity package (Wi-Fi, HSPDA, GPS, Bluetooth and FM radio).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the OT-990 units exhibited at the MWC wasn?t particularly impressive, but we really hope the retail version does better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ViewSonic MWC booth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also came by the ViewSonic booth to check out their latest tablets and smartphones. There were no new announcements at the MWC, but it?s still the first time we see some of the devices on this side of the Atlantic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ViewSonic ViewPad 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ViewPad 4 is a smartphone that?s supposedly going to run the yet unannounced Android 2.4 at launch. Now we are not particularly sure about the updates this new Android version will bring, but those should be announced shortly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ViewPad 4 is powered by the Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon chipset, featuring a 1GHz Scorpion processor, the Adreno 205 GPU and 512MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a 4.1-inch WVGA capacitive touchscreen, 2GB internal storage, 5 megapixel camera with 720p video recording, Wi-Fi b/g/n, HSPA, Bluetooth 3.0, GPS, miniHDMI and 3.5mnm audio ports and microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ViewSonic has plans to release the ViewPad 4 in May.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ViewSonic V350<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The V350 is a dual-SIM Froyo-running smartphone. The one thing that makes it special is the dual 3G standby. That means that you can have both SIM cards connected to (different) 3G network simultaneously. This in turn should significantly boost your data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the specs are pretty much standard ? a 3.5-inch HVGA capacitive display, a 600MHz processor, 512MB RAM and ROM (each), a 5 megapixel camera with WVGA video recording, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the only V350 unit on the ViewSonic booth had a dead battery so we couldn?t take any UI shots.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ViewSonic ViewPad 7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ViewPad 7 was announced back in August, but it? just now that we see it live. It?s a 7-inch slate with a WVGA capacitive screen, a 3 megapixel camera, 512MB RAM and a pleasing connectivity package. It runs on stock Android v2.2 Froyo, and judging from out first impressions performs marvelously.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ViewSonic ViewPad 10Pro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the ViewPad 10Pro, capable of dual-booting Windows 7 and Android v2.2 wasn?t present at the ViewSonic booth. But you can enjoy these hands-on photos of the ViewPad 10, the predecessor to the ViewPad 10Pro.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Altek A14 Leo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not everyday that you see a manufacturer like Altek. They might have only one smartphone in their portfolio but that smartphone claims to be the best shooter in the mobile world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course we are talking about the Android-running A14 Leo and its 14 megapixel 3x zoom-enabled snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Altek has gone with Android 2.1 Eclair for the Leo OS. The handset packs a 3.2-inch WVGA capacitive multi-touch display, various connectivity options (incl. Wi-Fi b/g/n, HSPA, GPS, Bluetooth) and microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, of course, the highlight feature of the Altek Leo is its 1/2.3" CCD sensor of 14 megapixel resolution. The high-end camera has its low-light capabilities enhanced by xenon flash and assisting auto-focus light. There is also 3X optical zoom (a first for Android) and 720p video recording on board. The list of camera features goes on with face and smile detection, ISO reaching up to 3200 and geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were able to snap a few shots with the Altek Leo and we also did a quick 720p video. We aren't particularly impressed with the image quality as the photos seem to be a bit low on detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors might be pleasing and the noise levels are acceptable but the little resolved detail makes having a 14 megapixel sensor somewhat pointless. On the other hand the 3X zoom is a really nice feat as long as you are willing to live with the added thickness it brings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we got this 720p Altek Leo video sample for you. It was shot with the lens in the standard, wide position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did another 720p video with the Leo, only this time we zoomed all the way in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Altek has brought a few customizations to the UI, but for the most part it is stock Android 2.1 Eclair. The performance though was slightly disappointing. There were way too much lag, missed swipe gestures and freezes. These are all issues we don't expect to find on a retail version of a smartphone.</paragraph>
