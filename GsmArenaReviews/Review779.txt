			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Asus had its IFA 2014 press conference today and unveiled the anticipated ZenWatch, the MeMO Pad 7 tablet, and the EeeBook X205 Intel Atom-powered netbook. We didn't get to see a new ZenFone from the company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most interesting item of the three is the ZenWatch, the company's first attempt at a smartwatch and one made in collaboration with Google, using its Android Wear platform developed exclusively for the form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch packs a 1.63" 320 x 320px AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 400 chipset and a built in microphone. It opts for an interesting design that's neither round nor square but has a 2.5D curved front that should make it feel more comfortable to wear and use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus MeMo Pad 7 is powered by a 64-bit Intel Atom chipset with a quad-core 1.83GHz processor and 2GB of RAM. The display is a 7" IPS unit of 1920 x 1200px. The tablet features a slick, metal design and weighs just 269g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet has a 5MP camera on the back and a 2MP front facer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Memo Pad 7 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 will come in Wi-Fi only and LTE versions, both of which share an impressive 8.3mm slim chassis. It's made of part duralumin and part fiberglass and it feels great in the hand. We were reminded of a large Nokia N9 due to the combination of curves and flat sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet is thin (it measures 200 x 114.4 x 8.3mm) and weighs 269g, fairly light even for a 7" device. The LTE version is a touch heavier at 279g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo Pad 7 is built around a 7" IPS screen of WUXGA resolution (1,920 x 1,200px). The screen is sharp and, thanks to the IPS tech, viewing angles are great. Contrast is pretty good too but we found the glass a bit too reflective, which reduces legibility in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet has a 5MP camera on the back and a 2MP camera on the front.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus MeMo Pad 7 ME572C/CL at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Asus continues its relationship with Intel and this tablet has a beefy Intel Atom Z3560 chipset with a quad-core 1.83GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and a PowerVR G6430 GPU. The device runs Android 4.4 KitKat, which the company has styled with its own ZenUI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom sides of the Memo Pad 7 (the short side) are mostly flat and house a loudspeaker each. A microSD card slot and a microUSB port are also to be found on the sides of the device. The tablet comes with 16GB or 32GB of storage and accepts microSD cards of up to 64GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 will come in a Wi-Fi only version (ME572C) and in an LTE version (ME572CL) by the end of the year. The starting price for the Wi-Fi model is ?200.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus ZenWatch hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not as impatient or ambitious as Samsung, Asus decided to wait for Google to make the Android Wear platform available before bringing its own smartwatch to the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZenWatch has a 1.63" AMOLED display with a resolution of 320 x 320px, resulting in 278ppi. Here's what the ZenWatch brings to the table.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus ZenWatch at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The watch feels extremely nice on the wrist, we can tell Asus took their time manufacturing the watch to perfection. The strap is exchangeable and made out of leather. It feels really premium and above the majority of smartwatch straps we've seen thus far. The strap is also easy to release with a latch on either side of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display looks every bit as good as those from Samsung's Super AMOLED Gear series of smartwatches. Viewing angles, typical AMOLED, are really wide and retain contrast even at extreme tilt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Asus ZenWatch is stainless steel and has pins where the charging cradle would attach. The latter has a MicroUSB port for charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android Wear looks really good but the unit we had wasn't much more than a demo version and we couldn't really interact with the OS. It will sync calls and notifications on your smartphone, count steps, find places for you and more. Given the ZenWatch has a built-in microphone it will be able to take calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus ZenWatch costs ?199 and is expected to arrive on shelves by the end of the year.</paragraph>
