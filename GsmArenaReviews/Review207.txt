			<paragraph>LG KC910 Renoir represents the latest and greatest of the cameraphone breed. It tops latest connectivity technology such as HSDPA, Wi-Fi and GPS with serious image and video capabilities. Xenon flash, face tracking and blink detection, geo-tagging and touchscreen focus are combined with XviD and DivX video playback and high-res recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir is also equipped with a 3-inch TFT display and the latest version of LG own Flash-based full touch user interface. It's simple, intuitive and functional, and is further enhanced by automatic screen rotation and landscape on-screen QWERTY text input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today LG announced that they are starting shipments of the LG KC910 to the European market. We however got an early start with a pre-release unit and we'd like to share with you our first enthusiastic impressions. We hope to push a detailed review somewhere in the near future, but until then this LG Renoir preview will keep you warm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KC910 Renoir at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At first glance LG Renoir seems remarkably compact for the rich multimedia capabilities it has got to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in the day, when we saw the first images of the device, the buttons below the display struck us as rather cheap looking. Now that we have in our hands, we see that we were wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KC910 Renoir has a subdued and conservative design, which however looks and talks shop. The high-quality materials used and the nice shiny finish add for a really nice first impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also have their full touch cameraphone - called the Samsung M8800 Pixon. We are working on a separate Pixon article, but we couldn't help but throw in a few comparative shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may notice that despite Samsung are claiming that the Pixon is a tad slimmer than the Renoir, the reality is that the Samsung M8800 is 1.5mm thicker. After a careful measurement with a caliper (yeah, way too geeky, we know), the Samsung Pixon scored a profile measurement of 15.5mm at its slimmest part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 20 Oct: We received a more final Samsung Pixon unit and as it seems they've successfully shaved a couple of millimeters off it, so indeed, the Samsung M8800 Pixon still retains the slimmest 8 megapixel phone title. There's a Samsung Pixon review coming up pretty soon, so stay tuned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us after this very short jump as we mark down our first impressions and provide you with hands-on report of how the LG Renoir looks and feels. We also have an impromptu camera shootout with the Samsung M8800 Pixon, which also happens to be at our office. But let's not keep you waiting, hit the next page for more of the LG Renoir design.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KC910 Renoir 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just to give you a size perspective, the LG Renoir is about the same size as the LG KU990 Viewty, but about 5mm taller. They even weigh pretty much the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir is building on the Viewty cameraphone popularity and adds a number of innovations to the equation thus separating from its roots. The design, feel and overall experience is different - and much better - with the LG Renoir.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Almost the whole front panel of the LG KC910 Renoir is taken by the 3-inch touchscreen display. It has a slight mirror finish but is just the same as the one in the LG Viewty. That means it offers nice picture quality but visibility suffers under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there is a video call camera and an ambient light sensor that allows the Renoir to dynamically change the screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware keys. Those are the red and green call keys, which share one row with the special shortcut key that opens an application launcher and the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera centric keys of the LG Renoir are two and they are placed on the right hand side of the device. The shutter key also starts the camera, while the image stabilization key activated the digital image stabilization for low light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD memory card slot and the proprietary LG connectivity port are on the right side of the device. We tested the LG Renoir with a 8GB microSD card and it worked flawlessly. The only thing lacking as far as connectivity is concerned is a 3.5mm standard audio jack, but we are sure one will be provided on the headset remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you turn the LG Renoir over, the impressive looking camera lens is the first thing that draws your attention. The lens has a mechanical cover, with unfortunately is not an automatic one. Sliding the ribbed ring around the lens opens and closes the cover and controls the camera automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safeguarding the high-quality lens is a really practical decision, but it's implementation might have been better. For example, the ribbed ring provides way too little grip and you can easily find yourself struggling with it to open the lens cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the slide wheel used on the Viewty, you can't use the wheel around the lens for anything else besides opening the lens cover. The manual focus function is not operated with it, but is instead commanded d by a virtual on-screen slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the LG KC910 easily fits in your hand and as far as we are concerned, it's a pleasure to work with. If you are after a really compact handset, then obviously the Renoir is not your thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jump on to the next page for a user interface walkthrough and a showcase of some of the key multimedia highlights.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The user interface has been updated<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG have done a great job updating the user interface that many of you know from LG Viewty and LG KF700. There are a lot more animations now, scrolling is much smoother and resembles a lot the one of Apple iPhone. For example, when you get to the bottom of a scrolling list, the items don't just stop scrolling, but they react to your swipes with elasticity as if they are almost physical. As expected every touch is accompanied by a short vibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only drawback we noticed is that the interface tends to be a bit slowish, every operation has a certain delay. It's not really a big deal, and some of you probably won't even notice it. But when compared to the LG Renoir, the competing Samsung Pixon feels much snappier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the updates of the interface is that the main menu items are no longer fixed - upon a longer press you can move the icons around and reorganize them - much like on the Apple iPhone, but without the wiggling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have also updated the Home screen widgets - now you have a wider choice of those and they are easier to control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among those there is a Weather widget, which periodically retrieves information about your local weather conditions. There is also a Contacts widgets, which offers image-based quick dial pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting fact is that when the activated widgets on your screen become too many, you can scroll them fluidly right on your home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The drawback of the new widgets system is that the activated widgets need some time to appear on the Home screen each time you wake up the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 was the first touch handset by LG to make use of a task manager and the concept has been transferred to the LG Renoir as well. You can run several Java and native applications simultaneously and switch between them with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing borrowed from KF700 is the Status screen - touching on any of the icons on the top status row opens up a screen that displays your signal and battery stats and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the LG Renoir interface selectively auto rotates when you turn the handset in landscape mode - for example when typing a message, browsing images or watching a video. The rotation is swift and reacts promptly to your movement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flicking through images is so natural, that this is the first time we finally see a manufacturer that has got it fluid enough to compete with the Apple iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video support is excellent and surpasses the iPhone capabilities by far - the LG Renoir played smoothly every DivX and XviD movie we threw at it. In comparison, the Samsung Pixon, which also has DivX and XviD support, didn't manage to play all of the videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the much promoted Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement is not available to videos - you can make use of that only in the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser of the LG Renoir retains the fluid feel that we are used to from the LG Viewty and LG KF700, but it's still far from the Safari browser. However now zooming in on certain elements of a web page is extra easy and is only a matter of press-and-hold on the portion of the screen in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the zoom feature is not accurate all the time and sometimes it fails to enlarge a text paragraph to a readable level. Other than that pages get rendered fast and very well and they even get cached, so the next time you visit a page it loads almost instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now you are welcome to join us on the next page where we'll be discussing the LG Renoir camera - we have a bunch of camera samples for you along with an impromptu shootout with the Samsung M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Whole lot of camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has not changed much as compared to the LG Viewty - the changes only concern the accommodation of the various new features and their control. One of the most innovative ideas of LG is the touchscreen focus. You can literally point on the screen which object you want in focus and the LG Renoir will make sure it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the LG Renoir introduces a bunch of other tricks to the game. Now you have a face tracking focus, which works nice but can only track one face - group shots are a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The blink detection feature is another first here, however it doesn't work as expected. Instead of emplying an automatic blink prevention shutter, where you focus and press the button all the way down letting the camera decide when to shoot to avoid blinking, LG have implemented it the other way around. You shoot your image and if there was a blink detected, LG Renoir warns you AFTER the shot has been taken. We doubt that this would turn out a useful feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Renoir video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Renoir has also inherited the excellent video recording features of the LG Secret. It shoots video clips in AVI file format utilizing the DivX 5 video codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the regular VGA@30fps video recording, the LG KC910 Renoir also offers widescreen video recording 640x384@30fps, which perfectly matches the screen aspect ratio. It can also record high-speed and slow-motion videos in QVGA resolution. In case you are interested in those, you check out our LG Secret video samples, which are pretty much identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, here's a quick VGA@30fps video sample, which looks great by the way.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The only new stuff in the video recording department is the microphone noise cancellation technology, which stops unwanted background noise from being recorded.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KC910 Renoir camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here are several camera samples produced by LG Renoir and some by Samsung M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Just to give you an idea of what the LG Renoir photos can turn out with just a wee bit of photoediting, here are their versions edited by us - images are downsized to 1024x768 pixels.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've got to say that LG Renoir was an immensely pleasant surprise because in our line of work we rarely see so much innovation in the course of two product generations. Other manufacturers (did somebody say Apple?) should definitely take note and act accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we feel that the LG Renoir could really use a more critical review article that would take into practical consideration its pros and cons, which we cannot cover in full in such a brief article such as this one. Stay tuned, we are already working on it.</paragraph>
