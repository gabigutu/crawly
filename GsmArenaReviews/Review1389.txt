			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s not the suit that makes a man and it?s certainly not a big fat logo that makes a phone. To be honest, the last thing Android needs to boost its credit with users is a big designer name. But for a change, this is one of the rare examples when a smartphone is not being eclipsed by a fashion phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we have here is a limited edition fashion item ? there?s no doubt about that. But it?s got a better purpose than blind you with bling. The phone has it all: impressive hardware, commanding looks and excellent build. The important thing though is you don?t care if it?s the Galaxy S or Armani taking credit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Super specs combined with beautiful finish, a dazzling Super AMOLED display in an impressively thin package ? a combination like that simply cannot go wrong. The Galaxy S line has long been committed to delivering high performance. With the Armani touch, looks and build quality are catching up. You can have anything you want as long as you are willing to pay the price. The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani is anything but cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung didn?t need perhaps Italian craftsmen working on the I9010 Galaxy S ? they already had the design tested on the AT&amp;T Captivate. However, someone at Armani must have had a say on the choice of materials: the appearance and hand feel are first class ? being subtle is no small part of that by the way. That?s another ? surprising ? point in favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, contrary to the stereotypes about designer phones, the Galaxy S Armani doesn?t boil down to a logo ? or lack thereof. What?s important here is that you are getting an all-inclusive deal: a full-featured smartphone with the latest technology available and an exquisite fashion item. Whether the logo implies Armani-approved or Armani-designed is irrelevant ? as long as the phone has the looks and the brains.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let?s get past the exquisite packaging and see the Armani droid in its full glory. Join us after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing might leave you slightly disappointed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This may be a self-evident statement but utmost attention to detail is what makes the difference between premium and standard grade items. The plain-looking paper box of the Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani does seem a bit too ordinary for a high-end handset. But soon you realize it?s the packaging of the packaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside, there?s another box shaped like a jewelry chest with an Armani-branded magnetic buckle. That?s where the actual phone is, along with the supplied accessories. Items are separately packaged in little boxes made of paper which almost feels like fabric to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the wrapping lives up to the name and this is exactly why you will probably feel a bit let down with the actual contents. We were hoping for a carrying case or at least a cloth to keep that Super AMOLED screen in prime shape. But we ended up with just a charger (Armani-branded), a USB cable and a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There wasn?t even a memory card. And yeah, we know the I9010 has 16GB of storage already, but it?s not like you can have too much storage. And mind you, this one here is not what they call an austerity package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If we?re to trust the hard numbers, at 122.5 x 64.2 x 9.9mm and 123 g, the Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani is virtually identical in size to its less distinguished sibling. In reality though, it feels much more solid than the mere 4g difference suggest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s mostly due to the high-quality surfaces ? but it?s also the better weight balance ? that makes the Armani droid a lot better to handle than its sibling. The I9010 allows a firm and secure grip ? none of the slippery rear surface of the original Galaxy S. And despite the fairly large size, the phone is rather easy to pocket, because of its slim profile.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We like the I9010 Galaxy S design so much we secretly wish the global Galaxy S looked like that. And yes, we used to envy AT&amp;T subscribers for being able to enjoy the best looking version of the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the sloped top and bottom or the ribbed back wouldn?t have been so appealing, had it not been for the high-quality soft-touch plastic and metal. Equally important ? to us anyway ? the styling of the phone is subtle and mature. A fashion version of an Android smartphone is a proposition we would typically be skeptical about. Well, not the Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani. They obviously got it right: it?s good looking, high-performing and ultimately tasteful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But no matter how sleek the handset is, once you turn the 4? WVGA Super AMOLED on it?s where all eyes will focus. We never missed an occasion to voice our admiration of the image quality of Super AMOLED with its incredible contrast, high resolution and spotless sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PenTile matrix might take away some of the sharpness, compared to regular screens but that?s hardly a problem in everyday use. After all you still have plenty of resolution to work with. The deep blacks however are obvious at the very first glance and chances are once you get used to them, you would never want to go back to regular LCD ever again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are also particularly fond of the deep and vibrant colors, but since saturated colors are not everyone?s cup of tea, you don?t have to agree with us on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the capacitive unit is top notch. As a matter of fact, the screen is a bit over-powered. It means that every now and again it will respond to your finger actually hovering a millimeter above the screen. Again ? whether you like this or prefer a slightly less sensitive unit that might occasionally miss a click, is strictly a matter of personal preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we have to mention that just like the regular Galaxy S, the I9010 Giorgio Armani has scratch resistant Gorilla glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we find four touch-sensitive keys below the display. That?s one more than the original Galaxy S?s home, menu and back trio. The new addition is the dedicated search button so you don?t need to long-press the menu key to go to the Google search box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys are large enough to allow comfortable use and their capacitive touch technology makes sure the transition between them and the screen is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you can see the earpiece and a couple of sensors. The proximity sensor takes care of automatically switching the display off during calls, while the ambient light sensor adjusts screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone hosts the 3.5mm jack and the microUSB port. There?s a sliding lid over the data port while the audio jack is exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is perfectly bare, but for the mouthpiece, which is placed right in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani we find the volume rocker, while the power/lock key is symmetrically placed across on the right. There?s no dedicated shutter key, which is a letdown for the HD video-capable 5 megapixel snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that damages the camera usability is the lack of flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is locked into place by the sliding piece of plastic at the phone?s bottom. Underneath you can see the hot-swappable microSD card slot, the SIM compartment and the 1650 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting that even though the battery?s capacity is 10% higher than the original Galaxy S, it would still fit fine in it as well without requiring a new battery cover or anything like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the larger battery (used on identical hardware) gives the I9010 Giorgio Armani a performance boost. We managed to squeeze a bit over three days of pretty heavy use out of the phone. Though we admit, we were careful not to use live wallpapers or too many background services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani is a phone of commendable ergonomics. But that?s not the first thing you get to appreciate. The styling is subtle but powerful and the handling is way superior to that of the original Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the keys are comfortable to use and the screen performs consistently with no drops of sensitivity around the periphery. In terms of usability, it would have been perfect to have a dedicated camera key. In terms of design and looks, there?s little else we would ask for. We wish the original Galaxy S looked like that ? there can be no bigger compliment to the GA version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface gets better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani runs on Android 2.2 Froyo and is one of the first Galaxy S phones to have it out of the box. As usual the TouchWiz overlay (or launcher as it?s technically called) is most prominent. It improves both looks and usability and integrates excellently to Android Froyo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the Giorgio Armani branding, there is almost no GA styling on the outside or any exclusive content inside. If you have used the previous Emporio Armani feature phone, you will recognize the Armani font, which is slightly different from the original Samsung one. The font, a wallpaper and a shortcut to GA?s website are the only GA things inside and barely pass have any added value by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters we've prepared a short video demo of the Galaxy S Giorgio Armani:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the user experience isn?t too much different from that on the other Galaxy S phones, we?ll reuse some portions of the text of our previous reviews. You can rest assured that we?ve reflected any differences we?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with the homescreen. It accommodates up to seven homescreen panes, which can be managed as easy as never before. A pinch zooming out gesture takes you to the edit screen where you can add, remove and rearrange the panes as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the Android 2.2-running I9010 Galaxy S GA brings a few new live wallpapers and lots of Armani still ones. You can find more wallpapers in the Android Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the improved notification area is one of our favorites. Packing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and sound toggles on top since Eclair it now adds an automatic rotation switch. These handy shortcuts can save you a whole load of digging in the Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen has remained relatively unchanged ? you now need to swipe to the left or right (rather than upwards) to remove the virtual glass pane covering your phone. There are cool alternative unlocking patterns too when you have a missed event ? a message or a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung home-backed widgets are still here and even new ones are added. There are no GA exclusives though. Some of widgets are preinstalled, while others are available for free from the Samsung Apps repository. Still there are so many of those available over at the Android market that custom widgets are hardly considered a selling point any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting change brought by Samsung for the Android 2.2-compatible version of their TouchWiz launcher is the built-in task manager. Coming complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently active apps, it saves you the need to install a task killer on your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in vanilla Android). List view is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also similar to the homescreen is the edit feature ? you just use the pinch zoom out gesture and you can add new or re-arrange the current menu panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the launcher is in the other edit mode (the one you select from the menu), you can uninstall applications (only the ones that you installed) just by tapping their corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani is perfect, but that?s hardly a surprise. The Galaxy S GA?s 1 GHz Cortex A8 CPU is doing a great job as usual and the 512 MB of RAM on board feel more than enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some benchmarks of the Galaxy S GA compared to the Desire HD:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An Armani-touched phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As typical Android (Galaxy S) smartphone, Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani has a phonebook with massive functionality and practically unlimited capacity. The Armani font we mentioned before is also seen here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the font, the default ?blank? contact icon is now different too. It has the GA logo and a person in full-height instead of the standard blue head.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory, SIM-stored and all Google contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place. You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen (courtesy of Samsung and the TouchWiz UI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S GA also packs the quick contacts feature, which pioneered on Android 2.1. It lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange, are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the New message interface. The side-sweep thing is part of the TouchWiz UI and works in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Giorgio Armani caused us no trouble during calls. The reception was good and we didn?t experience any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works like a charm ? the implementation is the same as in every other Galaxy S out there - it searches both contact numbers and names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy S GA. It scored an Average mark. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Swype-enhanced messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple - there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward, delete and lock as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ?depending on your needs - you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Giorgio Armani also sports a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the text input options are concerned, the I9010 Galaxy S GA comes with the Samsung home-backed keyboard preinstalled. It?s actually much more comfortable (and accurate!) than the often criticized stock Android QWERTY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you are for the ultimate speed there?s also Swype onboard. The innovative text input solution that took over the world is responsible for all current typing speed records. It does take some time to get used to, but after that it might even give you a chance to rival some hardware keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is also available and works quite good if you?re in a quieter environment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The gallery still downsizes the images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani comes with the stock Froyo gallery, rather than a modified TouchWiz version. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (and again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Galaxy S GA multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also use double tap or even the +/- buttons. Unfortunately zooming in isn?t going to reveal much more detail (if any at all).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end. It?s a real pity since with a large high-res Super AMOLED screen like that would have made every Galaxy S phone an excellent picture browsing tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An awesome video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If video watching on a mobile is what you like to do the Samsung Galaxy S GA looks like a great device for you. With powerful hardware, wide codecs support and a welcomingly large Super AMOLED screen there is very little more you could demand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated video player app has a nice and simple interface that automatically disappears when not used to allow you to enjoy your videos in their full shine. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s DvX and XviD video support as with the rest of the Galaxy S family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance with higher-res videos is great ? it played 720p videos like a champ. Little wonder, considering it can record 720p videos. There's a TV-Out feature (though it's only SD) or you could use the DLNA support to stream videos and photos to your DLNA-enabled TV or media player (any PC with Wi-Fi and DLNA-capable software would do too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Outdoor visibility setting is also present. It boosts the brightness and contrast of your Super AMOLED screen to give you better viewing quality outside. The video recorder also sports this option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S GA makes use of the TouchWiz music player. The interface consists of several tabs for the sorting options: current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove those you don?t need to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Samsung has enabled equalizer presets on the Galaxy S GA along with Samsung?s DNSe technology. You can use the Album art for the song (if present) or you can switch on the visualizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What?s even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with the added eye-candy, album view and song scrolling, things are almost as good as they can get now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no FM radio on board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>High-end audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani really excelled in our audio quality test. Not only was the handset pretty loud (more so when connected to an active external amplifier than headphones) but it impressed us with its clean output too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When an active amplifier is used the I9010 achieved downright impressive scores all over the field. The signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range are great and so are the distortion levels and stereo-crosstalk. The frequency response is simply flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you plug in a pair of headphones the I9010 Giorgio Armani loses some of its loudness, but still maintains a very good performance. As usual, there is an increase in stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion, but even those slightly worse readings are nothing to worry about. Also a small bump appears on the frequency response graph but it still remains within 1 dB of the perfect line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all the Giorgio Armani Galaxy S is a slightly more skilled musician than its already pretty good predecessor. Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S lineup is staying out of the megapixel race and the I9010 Giorgio Armani is no exception ? it packs a 5MP camera, which seems to be the norm for higher end Androids. This one?s also bare of accessories though ? no flash, not even a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is standard Samsung for the most part ? and that?s not a bad thing. It?s easily thumbable and offers readily accessible scene and shooting modes. Geotagging, face and smile detection are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S GA similar to its siblings lacks a dedicated shutter key and the virtual shutter key that?s not even half-pressable are to the detriment of the camera but once you get used to it, Samsung?s solution is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You use the touch focus feature to focus on your subject and tap the shutter key ? the camera auto-focus is among the fastest we?ve seen. This makes focusing on the subject (and possibly reframing the shot to observe the rule of thirds) by half-pressing the shutter obsolete. You frame the shot how you want it, focus on what you want and snap the photo ? it takes some getting used to, but in the end it works fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers a wide range of photography features, almost anything you can find in a cameraphone ? blink detection, image stabilization, geotagging, smile detection, face detection and auto contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S image quality is about average for the 5 megapixel league. The resolved detail is hardly impressive but colors are nicely rendered and contrast is pretty good. The metering seems a bit too enthusiastic, which works out fine in most cases but results in highlight clipping occurring slightly more often than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a few samples and judge for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording does HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani is capable of shooting 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface has the same layout as the still camera one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording is actually the better half of the I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani camera. The HD footage recorded in mp4 format comes up perfectly smooth with enough resolution and natural colors. Digital noise is also pretty well kept under control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch of extra saturation might have made the videos even punchier, but would also lead to some unpleasant side effects ? more unnatural colors and color clipping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani 720p video sample</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched sample, taken straight from the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S GA?s camcorder is one of the very few phones to feature continuous autofocus. Similar to the XPERIA X10, it may take a few seconds to refocus after you reframe, but unless it?s very rapid action you are trying to capture (and cameraphones aren?t particularly good at that anyway) this won?t bother you too much. In fact we prefer this approach instead of fast and constant re-focusing which in the end may ruin the video completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video to show you how it adjusts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The I9010 Galaxy S GA covers its connectivity bases alright ? worldwide ready quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the first Galaxy S phone ? the I9000 GA offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), the new Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo allows file transfers via Bluetooth, so there?s little else left to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides its 16GB integrated storage, the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S supports microSD cards of up to 32GB. The slot is under the battery cover. There is also 2GB of ROM, with 1.5 GB free space for app installation. As you know Android 2.2 Froyo enables installing apps on the memory card and the extra internal storage, so you shouldn?t be concerned about insufficient space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy S GA hassle-free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Flash-capable web browser is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Solid web browsing has been an inherent part of the Android deal since day one. And version 2.2 Froyo is the fastest yet ? and then there?s the Flash 10.1 capability, which really opens up the Web (which for better or for worse still relies heavily on Flash for video streaming and navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 4? screen for web browsing. The experience on the Super AMOLED featuring Galaxy S phones such as the Giorgio Armani is one of the best you can possibly get from a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S GA browser supports two zoom methods ? double tap and multitouch pinch-zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow, but it works only with double tap zooming ? a moment after adjusting the zoom level, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Froyo capabilities, the Samsung Galaxy S GA has Flash support in its web browser. YouTube videos played quite smoothly (360p-480p), so the games from the mobile section of Kongregate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a few Flash games worked very well in the browser (and are optimized for touch control). The high-quality videos on YouTube and other Flash video services had some dropped frames, but the overall Flash performance turned out even better than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly the I9010 Galaxy S GA comes with the ThinkFree Office pre-installed ? it?s both a document viewer and an editor. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the Office package is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app is descent and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also World Clock, Stopwatch, Timer and Voice recorder available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the inbuilt memory).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A few useful apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung filled the I9000 Galaxy S with tons of their home-brewed applications and we really appreciate their work. Most of them are quite useful and can be updated via Samsung Apps ? the secondary app repository on your phone. Whenever Samsung updates some of the current apps or widgets, or releases new ones, you?ll find them here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aldiko eBook is an e-reading app. It comes with three complimentary books, but they look kinda awkward. There are various font and color settings, but despite the big screen, it?s just not the best e-reading experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with only text, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing Holy Grail ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text and Go does almost the same job, but updates only your social network status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The popular Layar Reality browser is also pre-installed. It?s a search app enhanced by augmented reality. Your search results for various POIs ? gas stations, hotels, parking, restaurants, shops, etc ? are returned and displayed in an augmented reality environment using the handset?s GPS and camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS relies on Google services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S GA comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about four minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that Google Maps come preinstalled. Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation by Google Maps still has limited region availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Giorgio Armani doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market is where the fun starts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S GA is running the latest available version of Android and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market (some apps won?t run on older versions or low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We wish the Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani was carved out of a gold bar. It would?ve been so much easier. The world would?ve been a better place. But for a change, the Armani-branded Galaxy S is not a tacky, overdone and overrated piece of useless crap. It?s a phone that brings beauty and performance together to please even the most demanding user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t feel right when a fashion phone is the better smartphone. But not everything that makes sense to you makes sense to everyone else. Armani and Android ? they just don?t mix, do they? What?s the point in selling performance to customers that want bling? Does a smartphone need to be dressed up and well groomed?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But you know, these are the easy questions. And now for the tough one ? is the I9010 worth the price premium over a standard Galaxy S?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The answer is most definitely no in terms of user experience, and probably only just in terms of build quality and design. OK, some would gladly spend a little extra perhaps on superior materials and better looks, but how is that nearly 200 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, now that the Galaxy S can match the good looks of the iPhone 4 it only makes sense that it?s priced accordingly. And even the I9010 remains cheaper than the cheapest of last-gen iPhones if you discount carrier subsidies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it doesn?t even take the expensive Apple iPhone to realize that the I9010 Giorgio Armani is not doing as bad as it may look. True, it?s more expensive than the Desire HD, but the difference here isn?t that great and the Super AMOLED screen and the better build quality seem more than enough to show for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see how the Gingerbread-packing Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc will be priced, but we are guessing it won?t be notably cheaper than the I9010, not until the middle of this year at least. And until then it would be a choice between looks and functionality, which is never one-sided.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest though, there will be other phones competing against the XPERIA Arc. Destined to a niche existence, the Armani-branded Galaxy S is will struggle to reconcile its two different selves. To say that a very capable smartphone will be scraping a miserable existence as a fashion phone is not too far off perhaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani is a phone in which brilliant looks and brilliant performance are the two parts of a perfect whole. Its curse though is that very few customers will appreciate a perfect blend of fashion phone and smartphone. Fewer yet will want to buy it. Like we said, it?s not fair.</paragraph>
