			<paragraph>It is low, wide, and attracts sights from all around. It is not Ferrari, nor is it Lamborghini. I am writing about the new Samsung D800 - a luxury flat bar with sliding construction, featuring a display of exceptional quality and pretty rich software equipment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Main Disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D800 was firstly presented in November, 2005, along with other four mobiles, all of which were marked by their slimness. The mobile operator Vodafone has incorporated the D800 model as a part of its newest handset selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp; Samsung D800</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering Samsung D800 a successor of the popular Samsung D600 would be a mistake. D800's equipment is somewhat poorer. Nevertheless, the phone has a first-class construction and simple, modern design. Due to these features and to its interesting software options Samsung D800 is able to fulfill the requirements of even the most demanding customers on the current market. I am sure any decision to buy this mobile phone will be driven rather by emotions than by sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung D600</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Black magic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let me first make straight what I meant by placing exactly this heading at the beginning of this review. The D800 model is not up to getting into the "high society" of gorgeously equipped phones in the literal meaning of this word. Yet, this phone is impressive enough to present its owner at any chic party or meeting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first impressions Samsung D800 left in me have not disappeared yet from my memories. This slim slider with chromium-plated edges and glossy black cover does look very luxurious. The overall impression is only spoilt by visible fingerprints and the simplicity of the phone's rear plastic cover, which is pretty short of ideas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  As if made to be into one's palm</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone's construction is excellent. The two parts slide smoothly. No creaks. Arrests are ensured by springs, so what you need to do is overcome the primary resistance of the phone. End stops are solid, which makes the phone give out a loud clap, provided you do not stop its move prior to the final arrestment. The easiest way to open the device is to lay your thumb against the bottom edge of its top part. To close the device simply lean you thumb against the lug beneath the display. The keypad gets automatically locked a few seconds after the phone has been closed (unlocking it with closed phone is possible too). It gets automatically activated when the display part slides out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Side parts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone's dimensions are 97 x 52 x 14.9 mm. It weighs 98 g. Considering the fact that Samsung D800 is a sliding phone, its thickness of 14.9 mm is remarkable. The front cover is completely flat, except for the slightly elevated area beneath the display. The functional part of the keypad is even and flat. No uplifts. The numeric keypad revealed by the sliding part of the phone is level, as well. Fortunately, horizontal chromium streaks dividing the keypad lines are easy to recognize by touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> 14.9 mm</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone's system connector is protected by a cap and is located on the left side of the device Here you will also find a pair of buttons for the earphones volume control. On the right side there is a lonesome button, which activates the camera application. The back is boring. Made of matt black plastic, its only decoration is the manufacturer's logo, quite indistinctive, btw. Samsung D800's Li-Ion battery lies under the phone's removable rear cover. It is said to be able to supply the phone with enough energy for up to 210 minutes of phone calls and 220 hours in stand-by mode. According to my short experience however, Samsung D800 needs to be charged at least once in three days.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ice rink for your thumbs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The functional part of the keypad consists of a four-way navigation key with a confirming central area and 5 other functional buttons. The navigation key is a little bit unhandy and one can make mistakes. This inconvenience is caused most of all by the lack of touch distinction and by the surface evenness of the functional keys. As we can see, beauty always costs something, in the case of Samsung D800 - a certain degree of practical inconvenience. For example, a press on the central area of the navigation assembly connects you directly to WAP as the confirming option of this button is only available from the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Flat, beautiful, but somewhat clumsy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys surrounding the navigation button are much easier to control, mainly due to its bigger size. Press is low, confirmation comes as a silent, but clear click. The numeric keys operate seamlessly too. Getting used to their slippery surface and to the lack of vertical grooves requires a few minutes of training, though</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Chromium-covered bands not only look nice, but also help master touch orientation</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A Spectacle for the Eyes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>240 x 320 pixels of display resolution is a true spectacle for the eyes. Each pixel flares in 262K colors. Brightness is regulated in 5 steps. The pity however is that the display goes away completely after a mere pair of seconds, after which information about missed calls or messages remains invisible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you will see, Samsung has made use of every quality of this display. Phone's main menu is composed of 9 nobly colored icons with fine details. To enjoy menu's graphic to the limit, activate the menu style called "Flash animation", where selected icon gets bigger at the expense of the rest of the icons, making this way the original grid to bulge and provide more space for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Stand-by display ? common main menu ? main menu in flash style</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sub-menus menus consist of text only. Each one of them can be assigned a shortcut key. Feel free to allocate four of your favorite functions on the four ways of the navigation button. Keep in mind, however, that in stand-by mode the functions of the context keys are fixed - the left one opens the main menu, while the right one takes you to into the phonebook. Samsung D800 reacts lightning fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A stylish phone like Samsung D800 would have deserved more options of graphic modification. Unfortunately however, it features two graphic interfaces only - a blue and a red one. Number style is possible to setup too. Nearly everything - from font color, through rainbow-like image up to number notes stabbed on a cork notice board can be additionally modified or set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  If you do not like blue, go for the red one as it is the only one available ? unusual number options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung D800 main menu is organized on more or less the same principle as the menu of Samsung D600E. Its icons have been modified, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hello hello, is this the phone operator<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Calls are possible to accept or terminate by a single move of the sliding part of the phone. Incoming calls are announced by a 64-voice melody, a MP3 file or vibrations. However, vibrations and ringing are not compatible. Sound is played a moment after vibration intro has finished, but never simultaneously. Samsung D800 has no ringing profiles. It only offers a choice between loud and quite modes, executed by a press-hold on the "# "key. Sound is good and loud enough, with the missing bass elements being the only audio drawback. The same evaluation applies to the qualities of the receiver during phone calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Call lists</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone book is accessed by a press on the right context key. Do not try to assign the phonebook application to the down-way key of the navigation button, as it is no good. Quite surprising, but true.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only three contacts from the phonebook fit into the display en bloc. At the same time, each of them comes with a default phone number. The up and down-ways of the navigation button cannot be used for switching from one phone number to another inside one and the same contact entry. To see more contact details, press the central navigation area. The phonebook can store up to a 1000 contact entries, which are searched by gradual writing of their initials. Each contact can be assigned 5 phone numbers, an email address, a short text note, a picture and a specific ringing melody. Caller or recipient's image appears across the entire display. If the image is smaller, on the display you will also see caller's name or phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phonebook menu ? searching the phonebook ? adding a new contact ? setting up a group</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can serve for better organization of the phonebook, including assignment of a special picture or ringing melody to more than one contact at a time. Unfortunately, groups cannot be used as filters for incoming calls. The phonebook can be quickly filled with contacts via synchronization with PC.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>When you'd rather remain quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SMS, EMS, MMS, emails are all available. The phone is equipped with a T9 dictionary for easier writing, which does not use diacritics and thus does not shorten text messages. This is not true for MMS and email, though. If you prefer not to use T9 dictionary, simply deactivate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messages menu ? writing a text message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text messages are written in a block of 8 lines. The message editor advises of the amount of available characters, counting down from 1836. Information on the number of written fractional messages is provided too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D800 features a handy intuitive MMS editor, with which even a complete beginner will feel more than comfortable. The editor allows you to gradually fill in all 4 items on the page (object, picture or video, sound, text), which are displayed as icons with legends. If an item has already been setup, the black &amp; white icon gets colored. Each MMS can be previewed before it is eventually sent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Creating a MMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client manages up to 5 accounts through the use of the POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP protocols. The accounts cannot be opened simultaneously though. Only one of them can be active at a time. Settings are quite detailed. They offer a simple spam filter, which blocks selected addresses or emails featuring "forbidden" words in the subject. Further on it offers automatic download settings, size limit settings or email headings only. Attached files can be both sent and received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a new email</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Be creative<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Camera is located on the rear side of the top sliding part. When the phone is closed, camera lens remains hidden and thus protected from scratching or dirt. Next to it there is a tiny mirror for self-portraits. Flash diode is missing. The camera works with 1.3 megapixel, that is, it takes photos in resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Camera is hidden and protected</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera applications is started either by a short press-hold on the special side button, or from the main menu. Pictures are taken in vertical mode, no matter the fact that the camera release button is situated on phone's side. The entire display can function as a view finder, but bear in mind, that not all you can see on it appear on the final picture. That is why I recommend you to set borders to the viewfinder. The release button reacts with a slight delay. Do not forget it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Camera view finder ? functions and settings menu ? help</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white balance is controlled by the horizontal ways of the navigation key, while the vertical ways are used for zoom-in of the captured scene. Zoomed-in pictures are displayed in full resolution. The left context key offers access to the setup menu. Here you can select resolution, set up the quality degree of JPEG compression, use artistic effects. There is also a self-release function, decorative frames or release sound, zoom and exposure compensation. Fortunately, all sounds can be deactivated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be flipped vertically or horizontally by the help of a pair of buttons located on one of the phone's sides, but I don't know what this function is good for. Also available is "mosaic selection" of the captured scene, that is, you can take several pictures in accordance with schemes pre-installed in the phone, and then unite those pictures into one image. The basic mosaic scheme consists of 4 parts, but it is also possible to create a combination of three images or catch a portrait of a colleague of yours and then place a text bubble next to its face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Zoom work samples; delayed reaction of the release button (a move of the camera has deformed the end image)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All main functions of the device can be fast controlled by numeric keys. Samsung D800 creates pictures of rather average quality. Their edges are slightly out of focus, while capturing closely situated objects is nearly impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D800 shoots videos of pretty high-quality, in a resolution of 352 x 288 pixels. Such videos can even be watched on a PC. Samsung E720 was the first model, where videos of such high quality appeared for the first time on the mobile market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample video: busy street (3.3 MB, MP4 in ZIP archive)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pocket music and video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The extra functions offer is pretty extensive with the MP3 player being probably the most interesting one. It features visual effects, but suffers lack of certain qualities as to the functions implemented in it. Files saved in the phone can be organized in playlists, but sorting by artist or file name is simply impossible. The player switches from one file to another, but does not forward within one and the same file. The menu offers the following options: visualization setup, file repeat, tuning with equalizer of 4 preset modes, and 3D effect. The MP3 player is not possible to minimize. In other words, to execute a phone call you will have to switch off the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Various design modes of the MP3 player ? files list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we were not provided with earphones, so I am not able to evaluate the sound of the earphones enclosed in Samsung D800's original package. As for the loud speaker, it lacks bass elements and vibrates at maximum volume levels. Nothing special, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D800 plays videos of rather good quality, that is, in resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. The fact that videos can be watched across the entire screen, while the handset is held in a landscape mode, pleases a lot (do not look for this option in the menu, but simply press key number 1). However, the phone does not feature a forward option. In the case of music files, this drawback is not a big deal, indeed, but if somebody calls you five minutes before the end of the movie you are watching, you have no other option but see the entire video all over again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Playing movie in Samsung D800</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most serious and pretty limiting disadvantage of Samsung D800 is the absence of memory card slot. Even though the phone disposes of pretty much internal memory (80 MB), this hardly carries a single music album. Files stored in the memory are accessed through a well organized file manager, which consists of various folders: pictures, videos, music, sounds etc. Creation of new, additional folders is not permitted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;File browser ? browsing pictures ? memory state</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Data with EDGE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Time is organized by the calendar. As usual, you can choose from month, week, and days views. Besides, the calendar stores reminders, simple, non-alarm notes and tasks. All this information is distributed somewhat chaotically and could be rather confusing (especially after synchronization with PC).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; Calendar with reminders ? alarm clock setup ? calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D800 has three alarm clocks, which get activated even if the phone is switched off. They can be repeated, with each of them using a different waking melody. Among other extras there is also a voice recorder, which makes 60-minute records, a calculator, a world time measuring application, a measure and rate converter, a stopwatch with four meantimes, a countdown option and a smart picture editor. The picture editor modifies ready pictures, that is, it rotates and trips them, it crops them and filters them by colors, it inserts texts or frames and is even able to unite two images by overlapping them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;Measure converter ? stopwatch ? picture editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two java games preinstalled in the phone. The first one is a non-sophisticated logic game featuring a rabbit, which gathers carrots, while the other one is a classical cosmic air-fighter war game. Additional games or java programs can only be downloaded from WAP. Downloads of java applications through Bluetooth are also available, but once they are in, they would simply not get running. Games cannot be installed from PC's service applications, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Rabbit and rocket - pre-installed games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internet browser makes a full use of the qualities and the size of the display. The display views both WAP and simple web pages. Smallest font size allows for displaying 22 lines en bloc. Users with weaker eyes can pick up a bigger font that would suit their needs best. Data are transferred through GPRS or EDGE, both of which are Class 10. EDGE availability is indicated by a tiny icon. Samsung D800 can also be used as a modem for PC. Connection between phone and PC is established through Bluetooth or through a data cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phone is not everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since we did not get the phone in its original box, I cannot say, whether it comes with an enclosed CD with service software or not. If it does not, you can download the Samsung PC Studio 3 program for free on the manufacturer's website. The same application was used in the D600E model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung PC Studio 3 found the phone connected through Bluetooth pretty fast. If you minimize the program to System Tray, a single step towards the PC will be enough to renew the internet connection. Just make sure to confirm connection with a press on the left context key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This application consists of 10 sub-applications displayed in the form of icons. Here you will also find a simple guide on internet connection, as well as a file manager, which permits data exchanges between phone and computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main application window - select</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact information, details in the organizer (reminders, notes, tasks) and even data profiles can all be comfortably modified by using a computer keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;Downloading data from the phone ? Phonebook management ? organizer ? a list of data profiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the phonebook and the calendar applications, there is no doubt that these are much more comfortable to synchronize with Outlook. The backup program permits you to select not only the object, but also the direction and the mode of synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Synchronization and setup options (the program did not manage the bigger font size setup in Windows really well)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D800 offers the great option of sending SMS and MMS straight from PC, which saves the user plenty of time. What's more, the MMS editor is detailed and very well elaborated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  MMS editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This program downloads messages from the phone and downloads them subsequently. This means you can easily read and delete older messages from PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Opening SMS ? writing SMS from PC</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multimedia applications are a totally independent segment of Samsung D800's software. Pictures stored in the phone can be grouped into albums and further modified. Along with the picture editor, a surprisingly sophisticated video editor is also available, which comes in handy most of all when you need to modify a video record in order to save it into the phone. The editor makes cuts, modifies sound steps, and transforms files into the phone format. Sounds can be modified as well. In Samsung D800's original package you will also find a basic multimedia player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Files browser ? pictures editor ? detailed video editor ? sound modifications</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Black dandy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D800 is being sold for approximately 310 euros. I myself consider the price quite elevated in respect to the phone's equipment. What you pay for in the case of Samsung D800 is not equipment, but its brilliant construction and top-class design. The overall positive impression I got from this phone is additionally improved by its high-quality service software. On the other hand, we should not overlook some significant drawbacks, like the lack of ringing profiles, the limited MP3 player, and in particular, the somewhat unhandy navigation key. A phonebook with more fields assigned to each contact would have not been a bad decision considering Samsung D800's brilliant synchronization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are looking for a substitute of Samsung D600, you may want to take a closer look at Samsung D820, which features design similar to the one of Samsung D800. However, unlike the D800 model it is equipped with a memory card slot and a 2 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
