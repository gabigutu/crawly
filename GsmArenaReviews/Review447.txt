			<paragraph>We have tested the Sony Ericsson K600 with 3G support. It's similar to the excellent K750 in many things. The camera is worse, but it has two instead. Want to step into 3G? We have a proposition for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Key features<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a group of people, who will want to be prepared for the 3rd generation network upon any terms. Nowadays, there are few phones for these people, which get along with 3G. Another good offer is the new Sony Ericsson, called K600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The official pictures of Sony Ericsson K600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It stands next to the K750/W800 models in the company profile and has in fact very similar feature set. The K600 only has a poorer camera. It is almost a megapixel less; the second video call camera, mounted on the front side, partially compensates for the lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Look at every side of the phone (AVI, DivX 5.2, 2,5 MB)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Indistinguishable from metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The classic body construction has proportions of 104 × 45 × 19 millimeters. A little bit less fatness would suit better to such a small phone. The weight of 105 grams puts it amongst the phones with medium size. This is exactly the right choice for those who need to know that they have something in their hands, but at the same time don't want their shirt pockets deformed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson K600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colorful design is silver with black elements and lines on the sides. They optically lighten the phone fatness. From the reaction of those, who have seen the K600 live till now, we can judge, that the design of the newie is successful. It is an interesting combination of the retro style of the hi-fi devices from the 90's and supertemporal urban interpretation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The phone in hands ? its size, compared to a credit card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those, who will only look at Sony Ericsson K600 and don't take it in hands, can only guess that the silver chassis is apparently plastic. The illusion of metal is perfect at first sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson K600 from all sides </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>From all sides<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two buttons on the right side. Dependent on the menu, they function as a volume controller, camera zoom, and display illumination in inactive mode; also show phone information when in active mode. Below is the camera shutter release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Two operating buttons on the right side ? shutter release button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath are the charger and handsfree connectors. Why did Sony Ericsson come back to the authentic connector type, when the newie is equipped with the new Fast-Port connector? The microphone is mounted above the slots; the eyelet for a strip - in the center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Space for connector, microphone and eyelet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above is the main switch button - a classic feature of Sony Ericsson and Nokia. Next to it, under the cover is the infrared port, along is the status LED. After a long time, from the time of the old fellow T68i, LED is back again, informing, for example about the new messages. However, it's not really good. It is weak and - try to look around you - who of your friends places its phone with the upper side facing him?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The main switch button, infrared port and status diode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a rubber cover on the left side; below is a place for connector, equipped with USB cable. Here are also two locks, which hold the back cover in its place. The opening mechanism is solved in a clever way and contributes to the excellent solidity of the phone. You will get to know the whole system from the pictures. You'll find a 900 mAh battery under the cover. The indicated battery life reaches 370 hours stand-by and 500 minutes talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The sophisticated mechanism, assured by the back cover ? the battery</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pity that they aren't upwards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I mean the buttons. The construction side of the keypad is high quality, the ergonomics, however, doesn't impress much. I am not talking about the keypad layout, we have used to the location of the buttons from this brand - they are well placed. Only the buttons are sunk in such a way, so if you go over it with paper edge it won't hitch. That's why it's no easy and comfortable to push them and customers with fat fingers will have problems while writing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The keyboard buttons are too much sunk</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main operating button is a five way joystick, which has exactly the advantage, which the buttons lack. Its upper edge is high enough and is not shaky. It is very precise and for the whole time when using K600 I have "misfired" only few times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The joystick is excellent </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad illumination is rich blue. It doesn't single out the button forms, but directly the characters and numbers. The light however is not strong enough, so in the darkness it is not easy to see the keys' location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keyboard illumination</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It's all relative<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display is the same like the one of Sony Ericsson K750/W800. It's just a millimeter smaller (height and weight), the resolution is the same - 176 × 220 pixels at 262K colors. It has an excellent illuminating power and good contrast. Doesn't impress much however, compared to the K750. The body of K600 is slightly bigger than the one of K750 and there is no such big black area around the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson K600 display ? in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu doesn't surprise with anything special. This is a typical recent Sony Ericsson. The icons are very delicate and fine painted; there is some kind of animation almost everywhere in the menu. The phone is not slow, rather on the contrary. But the menu might freeze for a second while showing the impressive animations. The novelty in the main menu is the video calls icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Example of the possible views of the main screen and the menu  Another colorful theme ? the new video calls icon</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From stand-by mode the left context key shows the call list; with the right one you enter the menu. Beneath them are located the classic back button and the correction "C" button. Long ago Sony Ericsson threw aside the red and green receiver buttons, the calls are controlled by the context keys under the display only.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>See you, see me<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The button with the weird icon (you can hardly guess, what is it intended for), which was located above the joystick in K750, now has been moved to the right side of the phone. If you press it you see the activity menu with three tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortcut button for entering the activity menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the "my shortcuts" tab you can add all significant items from the menu, to which you want to have quick access. The "new events" tab collects the received unread messages, missed calls and alerts about the events in the organizer. The last tab is for bookmarks of your favorite web addresses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Personal menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A button with the same size is located on the left side of the display; it opens a separate window for video calls in 3G network. We'll have the chance to check out this function not until Christmas, when UMTS will be launched. By this time we can see how the display looks at video call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video call button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a place for picture from the front camera (CIF resolution - 352 × 288 pixels) in the left bottom edge. You can see yourself in it. The rest of the area is for the picture of the calling party. A narcisist would exchange the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Display at video call ? with exchanged images </paragraph>
			<paragraph>During the call you may zoom in the image x2 and adjust the exposure. It is possible to turn off the front camera entirely. You will be shown even in the darkness - the night mode will help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to show something of the surroundings to a friend on the other end of the line you have the possibility to switch to the main camera. The video call is activated very easily; choose or write number and after pushing "Call", press immediately the left video button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Open, Sesame!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have examined how the second camera works; let's describe now the main one. The built-in camera is protected by a rotating cover. The detents are in its corners. A mirror for self portraits would suit well, having in mind that the second camera can't take pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The lens cover is very simple </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an illuminating LED above the lens, which is not as good as the light in Sony Ericsson K750. It is single (K750 has two LEDs) and its illuminating power is warmer, not such sharply blue-white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The illuminating LED is above the lens </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is 1.3 MP, with 1280 × 1024 pixels resolution. It offers a 4x, smooth digital zoom, which works using crops. So, there is no possibility to use it at full picture size. The phone behaves like a digital camera while photographing but the auto focus is missing this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While photographing you may see in the left lower corner the selected resolution and how much pictures of that quality can be stored in the built-in memory of 33 MB. Four photo modes are available in the settings - normal, panorama, frames and burst. There are three picture sizes, night mode, light activation, self-timer delay, visual effects, and white balance setting; there is an option of recording time and date directly on the picture. The camera stores the capture data in the EXIF header of the stored JPG file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Viewing pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors came right. They are quite authentic; the exigent red and blue colors are the same as in reality. The whole area of the photos is sharp. There were some problems with the auto exposure - on the picture with the tree the sky is apparently overexposed. The text test is not good - it is not focused, taken from the classic distance of 30 cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        The sample pictures open in full resolution </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K600 records a video in 3GP format and 176 × 144 resolution. You can use the zoom while recording; the maximum length of the video is limited only by the free memory.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>500 contacts in the phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Phonebook is the same as we know it from previous Sony Ericsson models. It holds up to 500 contacts, it is possible to assign up to 20 items to each contact. To list a few: three email addresses, image, ringtone, company name, full address and birthday. While setting the birthday, you will be asked whether you wish to be registered it in the calendar too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Five tabs of contact info</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may choose whether you want to search the phonebook in the SIM card or the one in the phone. Not together. The search is based on the principle of step-by step character input. To one name you may assign an image and a personal ringtone, groups don't offer any of these. With the help of the groups you may filter calls or send mass SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the phonebook it is possible directly to see the default number without opening the contact </paragraph>
			<paragraph>72-voices polyphonic melody sounds when somebody is ringing. I must add that the sound quality is very good. MP3 and AAC formats are supported too. If all this stuff is not enough, a composer is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call service is practically perfect: silent ringing without refusal, microphone switch off, conference calls, built-in handsfree - K600 has it all. You may rely on the whole available memory when need to record a call.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Message editor works with text messages, EMS, instant messages and MMS, email also. The display takes in a maximum of four lines. Characters are bold, well visible even for customers with poorer eyesight. The black color for the text is really black, at W800 it was rather grey. T9 dictionary works reliably; it can be fully switched off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Message editor ? test message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text editor counts down the messages when the final characters are written. At every jump into another message a short alert appears on the display. You can assign text, picture, sound and a recorded video to the MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer functions are 100% the same as in Sony Ericsson K750/W800. The biggest defect on this beauty is the traditional lack of predefined notes. The organizer has monthly, weekly and daily view and only one type of event for everything. You may choose what day the week to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The organizer functions are identical to K750</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a to-do list with check off option for the tasks done; stopwatch. There is no currency converter. At synchronization K600 has the same problems as its forerunner.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Network and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connection to internet is easy. The phone supports UMTS and GPRS Class 10 data transfer; still no EDGE in this Sony Ericsson. The WAP browser is comfortable and can also display simple web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Addresses setting ? Mobilmania text version</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a stereo FM radio in the phone menu. It searches for stations with strong signal in a flash. Just press "Search" button and in a while you will hear a clear, noiseless sound. The wire of the earphones serves like an antenna. You may put the broadcast trough a loud speaker on the back side of the phone, but the sound is too gruff. "A little transistor radio" is the best description for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Radio supports RDS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main additional component in Sony Ericsson K600 is the music player. It can play all tracks in the phone memory; another possibility is the creation of your own simple playlists. It reads ID3 tags, but pity that when the player is in background and starts to play another track, there is no information about it; it can be placed on the upper part of the display, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Track selection ? rewind</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Repeating and random choice are available, setting of the equalizer too. Pity, that there is no possibility for further MegaBass adjusting. The basses are wonderful, the high and middle tones however are not that good again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Equalizer options ? MegaBass setting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, it isn't the walkman of W800. Moreover - we don't expect the K600 to be a full-featured MP3 player, because the 33 MB internal memory is quite insufficient. There is no memory card slot. To be fair, must add that the amplifier sound quality itself is high-grade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll find HPM-20 earphones in the package. They aren't fabulous though and can't compare with the quality of HPM-70 ea?phones (read Sony Ericsson W800 Review, where you can find detailed information). You can't, however throw away the delivered earphones just like that. They luxuriate most in middle tones, so an incisive English guitar will sound like a sawmill. The well-balanced sound and its clearness is another plus. Basses are decent; but the drums won't scare you. The range is not so open like in brand open earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Added HPM-20 earphones</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Communication with PC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may communicate with the neighborhood through Bluetooth, infrared port or with the help of the added USB data cable. An installation CD with the necessary programs is also delivered with the phone. To be comprehensive, I will introduce a brief characteristic of the software content package Sony Ericsson Suite:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File Manager: a way to access the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image Editor: works with images application - for wallpaper creation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS Home Studio: the program is for MMS template creation; they save to the phone and you may send them later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sync Station: program for data synchronization with the computer - with Microsoft Outlook and with the address book in Windows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile Networking Wizard: serves for automatic data connection settings. Even it seemed that it didn't detect the right network used, in the end everything was all right. Accepting the option proposed without any intervention was enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>When you are in love with 3G, don't think<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I am making purposely a comparison with K750 in the article. The two phones are similar to one another in settings and software. That's why the review is shorter; you'll find another operating and functional details right in the Sony Ericsson K750 Review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tested Sony Ericsson K600 looses only because of its poorer camera and the lack of memory card slot. It wins with the second camera and due to the video call option. Sony Ericsson K600 will be attractive to many customers, because it is one of the smallest 3G phones currently available. Another choice for them will be the Sony Ericsson K608, which differs from K600 only in the appearance.</paragraph>
