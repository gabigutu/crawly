			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No QWERTY keyboard, no SurePress clickable screen gimmickry, the BlackBerry Torch 9860 is taking the plunge. Not the first time that RIM are venturing into touchscreen but they're past the point of no return with this one. The BlackBerry Torch 9860 will walk among deadly droids and iPhones - probably the most hostile of environments in smartphone land.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No wonder RIM are extra cautious. They had a couple of scouts in touchscreen territory that didn't return. The Storm phones were exposed despite their SurePress disguise. Now, this time RIM are not beating the drum. Their first real touch-only phone doesn't seem to warrant its own name. It's simply a regular team member. A keyboardless model in the Torch lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We bet any of the Storms would kill to be in its place rather than a footnote in BlackBerry history. A history heading towards tablets, history in which the likes of the Torch 9860 will be playing an increasingly greater role.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry's latest OS 7 and the real-deal touchscreen experience will help the Torch 9860 find a niche of its own. Not that BlackBerry purists will ever get over the lack of a physical keyboard, but the Torch 9860 is not looking at them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, it has plenty to offer to long-term BlackBerry users with a taste for experiment. The Torch 9860 is part of a new generation of 1.2GHz-powered phones running the latest OS 7. It promises a new touchscreen experience and better specs across the board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you wonder though about QWERTY in the list of cons - it felt right to sound a warning to traditional BlackBerry users. It's too radical a change. So, the Torch 9860 will have a massive point to prove. You can take the QWERTY out of a messenger but never the messenger out of a BlackBerry. Coming up next is our pros and cons list, so let's get down to business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9860 has all the makings of a fine smartphone, down to the very price tag. That last one is no joke. RIM have always charged a premium on their phones. Nowhere to run if you need their service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the latest generation however that's finally becoming relevant in the outside world. More and better features, and refined user experience, RIM are keen to catch up with the standard-setters. It won't happen overnight and the Torch 9860 probably won't live to see it. But it won't be sorry for not trying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 needs not be ashamed of not running Android or any other best-selling OS. It's part of a new wave of RIM hopefuls that demonstrate the company's confidence to take a new direction. Success is built on trust, and RIM of all companies should know that. They are trying to appear credible to a whole new set of users. If nothing else, interesting times ahead for the BlackBerry Torch 9860. Let's hope it's not a curse.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9860 comes with a standard set of accessories. It doesn't get a leather carrying case like the Bold Touch 9900. A USB cable, a charger head and a set of headphones are provided. You get a complimentary 4GB MicroSD card too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Torch 9860 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 looks bigger than most of its 3.7" competitors. Extra space below the screen was needed to accommodate the standard set of physical buttons, all five of them. At 120 x 62 x 11.5 mm it isn't the most compact smartphone and has respectable heft. Tipping the scales at 135 g, it has every bit of BlackBerry solidity that users feel they're entitled to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is still quite comfortable to handle and operate. Everything is quite thumbable on the reasonably big touchscreen but the menu key is still essential to the navigation. Some of the options are deep in the system menus, only accessible via the menu key. The call buttons are welcome and the trackpad comes in handy where extra precision is needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9860 is less imposing than its touchscreen siblings, the two Storms. It feels almost ordinary, with a dash of cheap. There you go, we never thought we can say that about a BlackBerry. We guess most of it goes down to the glossy black bezel up front. Around back, things are looking better. The battery cover is made of metal but with soft, grip-enhancing rubbery finish. We liked the slanting top and bottom chrome colored edges too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an unusual combination of premium-looking rear and plain plastic front. Maybe RIM wanted to set the phone apart, seeking to avoid high-end connotations. A strict business look was not on the agenda either. The audience of the Torch 9860 will perhaps be younger than average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's let the phone do the talking though. The 3.7" WVGA capacitive touchscreen is quite inviting with a pixel density of around 252 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has very good brightness and sunlight legibility won't be a problem. It's a pleasingly crisp display with excellent contrast and vibrant colors. The touch response is great but there's no haptic feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We particularly missed that in the keyboard. By the way, the virtual QWERTY is quite uncomfortable to use in portrait. Flip to landscape and things get better. How much better though will be ultimately up to Blackberry users coming from a physical keyboard to decide. Another thing to note, the auto-rotation has a notable lag. We hope this is a unit-specific issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, is the typical BlackBerry navigation combo of Call keys, Menu and Back buttons. They're all big enough for comfortable use, slightly raised and solid to press. Placed in the middle is the trackpad, which will get its share of use, especially in the system menus that aren't all that touch friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece and status LED are the things to note above the display, where the BlackBerry logo takes a prominent spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Torch 9860 there's only a MicroUSB port used for charging and file transfers. Its central position is not the most comfortable. A plugged cable will get in the way if you need to use the phone while charging. On the other hand, it favors landscape use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on the right side. Below it you have volume keys, with a very subtle mute button in between. It doubles as play/pause button in the music player. The convenience key near the bottom is set by default to serve the camera and this time it makes sense. The button is tiny but very tactile and has distinct half press for locking focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock button is placed at the top of the BlackBerry Torch 9860, a return of the invisible keys from the previous generation of BlackBerries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone has the same glossy plastic finish as the top and only features the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, the 5MP camera lens comes with a LED flash. A thin slit just above them marks the loudspeaker. The metal battery cover has rubbery finish, which feels nice to touch. A chrome frame runs around the back, with the top and bottom portions slightly raised to give the device a subtle inward curve. If you rest the phone on a flat surface the back panel won't get scratched or the loudspeaker muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover pops up as you push a tiny latch at the bottom. Underneath you'll see the 1230 mAh Li-Ion battery and the hot-swappable MicroSD card slot. The SIM compartment is under the battery, a tiny yellow handle helps eject the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry claim 330h/320h of stand-by (in 2G and 3G, respectively) and 4:40/6:50 hours of talk time. Music playback should be around 44h. In real life our unit went through a day of intensive usage (web browsing over Wi-Fi, music playback, the usual imaging test, etc.). That's basically what you should expect of the Torch 9860 if you don't give your smartphone much rest. If used sparingly, the Torch 9860 will probably give you two days at most on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't have doubts about the build of the BlackBerry Torch 9860. We're not as impressed as usual with the design, although it has some of the typical BlackBerry touches. The phone feels solid, but not in the usual impressive and elaborate way. We think that's on purpose though - they didn't want the Torch 9860 too sophisticated or too masculine. The phone handles nicely. The fingerprint-prone front and the audio jack placed on the side are some minor niggles.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 7: now with more horsepower<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new OS 7 had a chance to demonstrate its newly found color, speed and agility in our BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 review. The BlackBerry Torch 9860 is pretty much the same package in terms of software and features. The bigger screen is the difference - that and the physical keyboard, which is missing in the Torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are going to look at the OS 7 in detail again, for a complete and comprehensive coverage of the phone and its features. There are parts of reused text but that's inevitable given most of the interface is the same, only on a different scale. And you can rest assured that all the BlackBerry Torch 9860 specifics are duly reflected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Number 7 is the last upgrade of the OS before the switch to QNX. The OS 7 brings very few new features (NFC and HD video are well worth a mention though) and focus should be on the user experience instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new platform is based on a 1.2 GHz processor and more potent graphics hardware, and it?s exactly the higher system requirements that won?t allow older BlackBerry phones to run the new OS 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our traditional video demo to warm you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 7 is trying to look like the QNX-based Tablet OS. The UI icons have been updated to mimic the PlayBook, but the rest is pretty much the same - functionality changes are kept to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen has virtual buttons in a row, allowing you to quickly toggle the cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth radios. It gives you quick access too to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking on the loudspeaker icon underneath lets you change the currently active profile, while the magnifying glass on the other side of the homescreen lets you start a search. BlackBerry OS 7 is voice search enabled, too. Tapping on a small mic icon next to the Search bar will activate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events - SMS, email or missed calls - can be quickly accessed by pressing the bar between the search and profile icons on the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that is the app tray, which consists of several tabs. You can easily swipe it out of sight or pull it up to show one to five rows of icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sideways swipes reveal the different panes that sort the main menu into All, Favorites, Media, Downloads and Frequent. The frequently used apps list are auto populated by the system. You can define which of the main menu panes should be shown. Folders can be added to the main menu and items can be moved into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either use the menu key or tap and hold on an icon to reveal options such as Move, Mark as Favorite, Move to folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there is a trackpad and there is a touchscreen. The trackpad is the usual sharp and precise control. One place where it makes a lot of sense is in listed submenus that pop up as you press the Menu key. Not that they are not thumbable - it's just that wrong presses are completely ruled out with the trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much everything you see is clickable in BlackBerry OS 7 and works the way it's supposed to. There are still small elements such as the homescreen Search and Profiles icons, which are easier to access via the trackpad rather than the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The important thing to note is that, unlike the flat iOS layout, the Torch 9860 has a menu button to access options that are not visible on the screen. You get used to that pretty quickly though so in the end, the Torch 9860 manages to keep both new and returning users happy. Trackpad and touchscreen complete each other in a natural way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A familiar phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 may run a new edition of the OS, but its phonebook is the same as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities get displayed. Smart search lets you find a specific contact by typing a part of the name, so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Torch 9860 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In edit mode, the available contact details are neatly organized. You can replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In calls, the BlackBerry Torch 9860 is the usual solid performer. No voice quality or reception issues. Smart dial is of course enabled - you only need an extra tap on the Search button to bring up the virtual QWERTY keyboard. It's still a quick way of locating contacts on the handset. You just punch a few keys straight on the homescreen and a list of suggestions is promptly returned. You can then select the contact you need with the trackpad or tap directly on its icon to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Dial is also available via the Universal Voice Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 scored a Very Good mark in our traditional loudspeaker test, so you should have no concerns about missed calls and messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging - BlackBerry style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 handles has all kinds of messages. You get SMS, MMS and email support out of the box and there are also a few IM apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, a BIS account is a must if you are to use email on the Torch 9860. And while we understand the advantages of the BlackBerry internet service, it would have been nice to give users some kind of choice. You know ? you can go for the security we offer or you can use whatever internet plan you have and live without it. Without an enterprise account, your only option is web-based email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn?t forget that not all carriers are offering BIS. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned its name over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editors, which look identical for all types of messages, are pretty simple to use and with a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. That one turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and smart-dial kicks in, giving you a list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 has no hardware keyboard. The virtual QWERTY does a good job in landscape mode but in portrait the limited space is a problem. Extra care was needed to avoid wrong hits.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music Player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surely RIM have refreshed the Music Player icons, but that?s basically all they did. It?s still pretty conservatively styled, but most of the functionality has been there since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s quick searching of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Creating custom playlists is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, but unfortunately, there's no indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great video codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We liked the Bold Touch 9900 for its video-playing capabilities and the Torch 9860 should be even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger screen is an obvious advantage. The video player's interface might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are the usual playback controls when you hit a key or tap on the screen plus a dedicated fit/zoom to screen one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9860 video player promises to support DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 and WMV videos up to 720p resolution. It did manage to play all of the DivX files we threw at it, WMV, MOV and MP4 files up to 720p were no problem either, but the XviD ones didn?t go that easy. Some of the files were OK, while others where just incompatible. It seems it's a bit rate or audio thing, but we won't count on that XviD support much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, which is probably more than most BlackBerry users will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simplistic gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery hasn't changed since the OS 6, so it should be familiar to all the BlackBerry users already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid or viewed as a standard list. There?s searching by name here too, but we?re not the type that remembers the names of our image files, so we won?t count that one in favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Bold Touch 9900, the Torch 9860 has a built-in accelerometer to automatically toggle portrait and landscape mode as you browse your picture collection. There's a noticeable lag in the auto-rotation though, which tends to get pretty annoying. And it doesn't just affect the image gallery. This may be a minor glitch of our test unit but the accelerometer does seem to act up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are panning and zooming, including the pinch zoom. A tap and hold on a picture provides shortcuts for sending, copying and renaming. You can set it as wallpaper as well or use as a contact photo. Further options such as image properties, rotate or slide show are available in a popup menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 audio quality is hardly the best on the market, but it's still among the most gifted musicians in the RIM family and that's probably going to suffice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to the line-out (i.e. the active external amplifier) the Torch 9860 does really well. It has decent signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk. The volume levels are high and there's next to no harmonic distortions. Intermodulation distortion and frequency response are a bit worse than average, but it's nothing that's easy to detect with a naked ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some issues arise when you plug in a pair of headphones, though. The volume levels do drop a bit, but the main problem is the rapid rise in stereo crosstalk - it really goes through the roof with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 5 megapixel auto-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 comes with a 5 megapixel auto-focus camera which is still the highest resolution you can get in a RIM smartphone. Auto-focus prompted a sigh of relief after the experience we had with the Bold Touch 9900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comes with the same unattractive interface and relatively low number of customizable settings. A shortcut bar at the bottom of the viewfinder is standing in the way of proper framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is unusually shaped but actually quite comfortable with distinct half-press for auto-focusing. By the way, you can set auto-focus mode to continuous. If nothing else, it's the quicker and easier way, and you can shoot with a single press of the trackpad, shutter key or the virtual shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight in the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Torch 9860. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Torch 9860 is on par with the Bold 9900 except for the macro shots thanks to the auto focus. So the photos are sighlty about average (still an achievement, given the RIM history) - there is a good amount of resolved detail and colors are pleasing. Contrast is fine, too, but the noise levels are way above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the BlackBerry Torch 9860 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. Here you can see the Torch 9860 is a decent performer and is on par with its Bold 9900 sibling. Compared to some of the most popular 5 megapixel droids such as HTC EVO 3D and Desire S, Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY, LG Optimus 3D and Black, and Samsung Galaxy S you can clearly see the Torch 9860 is on par or even better when it comes to resolved detail and accurate colors. The lighter noise reduction plays a part in that too, it's a technique we've already met in the iPhone 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressive HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 is part of the new generation of HD video-enabled phones by RIM - along with the Bold 9900 and Torch 9810. It is capable of shooting 1280x720px videos at 30 fps and can use the LED as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is up to scratch ? the frame rate is good, the resolved detail is adequate, the noise levels tolerable, the colors accurate and the contrast is fine too. Our main concern is the higher compression levels applied in the processing, but that's to be expected in 3GP videos. Overall, it's thumb's up for the BlackBerry Torch 9860 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a 720p video sample from the Torch 9860 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is another we've uploaded to YouTube for your convenience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity lacks NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 is giving you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect from a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the quad-band 3G with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA gives you the extra speed. The dual-band Wi-Fi is also a nice addition with an easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Wi-Fi hotspot is also supported. Stereo Bluetooth rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 has a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the BlackBerry Desktop Software. It allows you to sync your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9860 is not NFC-capable - only the flagship Bold Touch 9900 gets that treatment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No Flash for the web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Torch 9860 is a nice improvement for the BB platform. It is comparably fast and responsive, it supports multi-touch zooming, text selection, text reflow, mouse cursor, etc. The only thing missing is Flash support really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it does have its woes, we?ll give it that. Based on the Apple?s WebKit engine and using a similar caching system as the iPhone, the new BB browser reacts surprisingly like the one on the iPhone 4. Unfortunately, its performance is not the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, both browsers use what is known as a backing store to cache the already rendered page thus they show showing users a texture, rather than a real page. This way you always get a great performance while panning or interacting with the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you zoom in, the browser is not ready with the new texture, so it simply zooms in the already rendered one, effectively upsizing it, which makes both the text and images look blurry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here?s where the difference in the performance of the iPhone 4 and the BlackBerry Torch 9860 shows up. When you zoom in on a portion of the text, on the BlackBerry it does take a second or two to clear up the hazy cached image of the text, while on the iPhone 4 that?s an instantaneous action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you got speed in panning and scrolling, even in zooming because the texture is quick to refresh rather than to zoom on a heavy page, but you get a little annoying refresh moments on zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that's something you won't see on a stock Android browser because the fonts there are rendered in real time. But the heavier the page is on Android, the longer the refresh time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, again unlike the stock Android browser, the text reflow works only once - when the text is out-zoomed and you double tap on it. The text reflow stops working when you zoom in even more or turn the phone in landscape mode. The iPhone 4 web browser works the same way however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we won?t bore you to death with these little nitpickings. The BlackBerry Torch 9860 web browser is a fast and modern piece of software, it renders pages nicely almost like a desktop browser and it will always get the job done unless you?re reaching for some Flash content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting that if you decide to use the trackpad for navigation instead of the touchscreen, you'll get a virtual mouse cursor and automatic panning and scrolling when you reach the end of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except for the missing Flash support, the handset provides a solid browsing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business objectives, the Torch 9860 has a solid set of organizer tools. Although the interface is not preoccupied with looks, the usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customized events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with the full version of Quick Office pre-installed allowing it to view all kind of documents (incl. PDF) and edit Word, Excel or Power Point files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be accessed via the menu and trackpad. You can set the tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity. Given the single slot limitation though, getting an alternative alarm clock app from the BlackBerry App World seems like the right thing to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another way to get more alarms though. You can go the the Calendar app and choose to add a new alarm from the menu. It allows you to put subject and recurrence too and works just like the alarm in the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the usual functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock comes on screen any time the phone is being charged and also offers a bedside mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a Password Keeper app, Voice Recorder, Memos and Tasks app to store your passwords, voice memos, text memos and tasks. There is a digital compass too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Protect is onboard. It can locate and remotely lock/wipe your lost or stolen device. It also syncs your data and can easy transfer everything to a new BlackBerry device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Torch 9860 comes with Facebook and Twitter applications. You also get the native Social Feeds app that gathers all of your Facebook and Twitter updates in one place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is the RIM application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or Paypal. Some apps you can get for free of course. Apps can be managed on a computer. There are enough categories and a search box to make searching easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest titles. In general there's hardly much to complain about the BlackBerry App world interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of applications isn?t as impressive as in the App Store or the Android Market at just over 14500 apps, 3500 games and 12000 themes, and to make it worse only a small fraction of the titles are actually free (though some of the paid apps offer free trials).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Maps needs a BIS plan<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Torch 9860 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. And the only navigation option you get is directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get directions you can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map at the expense of a few clicks. The map data has also been updated, including more cities than ever. We can still think of at least several apps with more detailed maps, but let's not get too picky here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no point telling RIM to mind their own business. That's what they've been doing all along. It's what made them the brand of choice for corporate customers. Some may argue that corporate users don't quite get to choose - and we can see a point there. But choice is something RIM are not afraid to make.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new BlackBerry generation offers better specs and improved user experience. They are closing the gap, although still catching up with last year's top performers. We guess it's a comfortable position for RIM, behind but not losing sight of the leaders. Safe in the knowledge that they have something unique to offer, but not too complacent to learn and do better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, they had something to unlearn too. Sometimes, short-term memory loss can be a good thing. RIM had to forget about the Storm if they wanted to make a difference. They can take something from the experience but the Storm belongs in the closet with the other skeletons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9860 is a new way RIM go about this whole touch affair. Not that the OS 7 is radically different in its approach. It's the fact that for the first time they're going for a traditional touchscreen. In a way, they're going against their own nature with a keyboardless messenger. No excuse this time, no hiding behind SurePress, they're going head-on against all kinds of fearsome competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the traditionally high asking price is doing the Torch 9860 no favor. You can get pretty much every top smartphone for the money they're charging. And we're talking super phones like the Samsung Galaxy S II and the HTC Sensation, or the 3D-enabled LG Optimus 3D P920. These are high end droids with raw power to spare and refined touchscreen experience. We can throw in some Symbian and Windows Phone 7 flagships too but we guess we made our point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S II ? HTC Sensation ? LG Optimus 3D</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems there's an important difference between the Bold Touch 9900 and the Torch 9860. The Bold Touch has a single major rival, whereas the Torch 9860 has the misfortune to compete with all kinds of premium gadgets. You figure which has better chances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfair? Well, maybe it is. But that's how things are. That's how you tell the flagship from the wannabe. In the world of BlackBerry, the flagship is the one with the keyboard. We're all used to it being the other way around. But Berries play by their own rules.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes confidence to break the rules and RIM have been building it. Yesterday they were running late to an appointment with touchscreen, today they're in tablets. The Torch 9860 is a small but important step. It won't make a big splash as a phone but there will be ripples across the BlackBerry pond and hopefully, we?re about to find out how big they can get.</paragraph>
