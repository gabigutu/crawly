			<paragraph>Motorola have continued their tradition of the RAZR-like designed phones and the L-series has a new member, the SLVR L9. This phone is a direct successor of the L7 model and they do have a lot in common. In fact, they have almost no difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This handset is mainly targeted at the mid-range personal use. It doesn?t have some business enhancements or any media gadgets to offer, so its main purpose is to serve telephony to the users. With a new keypad, added EDGE supportand FM radio and a more powerful camera, L9 is headed to replace the older SLVR model and probably make some new friends on the way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we first saw the L9 we thought ?it?s just like L7!? and we were eager to find out what were the differences between them. After short time we discovered that there are only few changes. Our opinion is that the final impression can be largely linked to the price tag that goes with the phone, as if it turns out to be much more expensive than its predecessor, it won?t pack a good deal. But if they are in close price range, buying the L9 would make sense. Now, let?s get into more detail about that new L9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that the test unit we got is a pre-release one and some bugs are really acceptable at this product development stage. Some options and applications may vary in the final retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usually, Motorola kept the familiar SLVR design and continued the successful line of L7 and L6. The new thing here is the glossy front panel of our test device. The silver framing of the keypad and display is so shiny it can be even used as a mirror. The back of the phone is made of some rubber material and feels firmly in one?s hand. We didn?t hear a single creek sound from the phone?s body and it proved physically perfect during our tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the same size as the L7 model, 113 x 49 x 11.5 mm and the same weight of 96 grams, the phone feels great when held in hand - just as heavy to allow you to use it easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola L9 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the silver glossy frame, the front of SLVR L9 also consists of a small Motorola logo on the very top, between the grills of the main speaker, and the sign ?MOTOROLA? beneath it. Just below, is situated the display, but we?ll say more about it later. A contour line divides the space between the display and the keypad. From this line down comes the controversial keypad of Motorola SLVR L9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola SLVR L9?s front side ? The main speaker ? the keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the phone we found only the 2 megapixel camera lens, a small USB sign, indicating where the USB port is, the Motorola logo once again and two signs telling us that the phone has memory card support and records video. That?s all on the battery cover. On the very bottom of the back side is the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phone?s back ? the camera lens ? the loudspeaker grill</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you take the battery cover off, you can see the Motorola BK 60 880 mAh Li-Ion battery. The manufacturer promises that this battery will provide about 350 hours of stand-by time and up to 4 hours of talk time. Whether this is true or not, we could not find out in our tests as we did not use the phone in ordinary daily fashion. Underneath the battery is the SIM card bed. The card is easily inserted and taken out, so there are no problems here. A good thing about Motorola L9 is that it supports the new MegaSIM technology which means that it allows for special SIM cards having up to 1GB of memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Back cover off ? BK 60 battery ? the phone?s back without the battery ? the SIM card bed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the phone has a button, which releases the back cover, and an eyelet for a neck or hand strip. The bottom is bare. The left side is home to the two volume keys and the voice command/record key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The top and bottom of Motorola L9 ? the left side and the volume and voice buttons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side shelters the miniUSB port, the camera release button and the microSD card slot. Because of the standard USB port, Motorola L9 can be connected to a PC using a cable, most of you probably already have. The manufacturer puts such ports in most of their phones and that is something to be appreciated. Recently Nokia has started to do so, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The plate is plastic, not metal this time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of L9 is on a plastic plate, not a metal one like in the previous L7 model. The other main difference is in the way the keys are divided, meaning they have small bulging lines between them and two bigger vertical ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is, as usual, made of two parts ? functional and numerical. The functional part includes two soft keys on top, the 4-way circular D-pad with confirming center, which has become a proprietary Motorola solution, a FM radio key and the green ?receiver? button on the left and a correction C/Back button and the red ?receiver? button on the right side of the circle. Bellow those are the numerical keys. The keypad is easy to use and spacey enough to push the desired button and not make a mistake. Backlighting is perfect. It gets the keypad evenly illuminated in blue and makes it perfectly visible in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The keypad ? the metal D-Pad ? L9 keypad in the dark</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The display is sufficient<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola SLVR L9 is equipped with a 2 inch TFT display, capable of displaying 256K colors and a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels. The exact same display was used in the Motorola L7 too. Well, as the saying goes: ?if it ain?t broken, don?t fix it?. This holds true here. The display is good enough, the colors are vivid, the picture is clear and it gives enough space to visualize everything that needs to be shown. Of course, we could?ve asked for more, considering that most of the recent phones have finer displays, but we think this is enough as we are talking about a budget mobile after all. The backlighting of the display is good, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The display in bright light conditions and in dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main purpose of mobile phones is to make calls and L9 does that just fine. The sound during calls is good, signal strength is ok and the phone alerts of incoming calls loudly enough and with well-noticeable vibration if needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Making a call</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Yet another Motorola interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standby display of the phone offers a signal strength bar, ringing profile icon, battery strength bar, the operator name and a digital clock in the bottom. If you like, you can put in the middle a cross with the four ways of the metal D-pad with applications assigned to every way. The labels of the two functions assigned to the two soft keys are shown in the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new thing in the L9 is the Juix interface which is used in the phone and is the new solution from Motorola. It is somewhat different from the previous user interface implemented in older models like L7. Opinions regarding this interface are controversial as some people consider it better and easy to navigate but others think it?s not that much of an improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The stand-by display with and without the 4-way cross</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is made of 3 x 3 matrix grid of animated icons. Motorola users will have no problems orientating in the phone as the manufacturer uses the same interface with slight changes in many models. Some of the sub-menus are made like tabs with 3 icons in line while others are just text lists. The one thing that leaves a big impression, though, is that the test phone has a pretty slow interface. Since we haven?t seen such a slow user interface in other recent Motorola mobiles, our best guess is that this dysfunction is restricted to our test unit only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The main menu ? Some of the available color skins</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When inactive, the phone can start an animated screensaver but of course, this takes its toll on the battery so you will be better off with switching the screensaver option off. The phone also offers an Airplane mode which turns off all network services. You can set the phone to ask you every time you switch it on whether to start in airplane mode or not. A nice option is that you can switch to Airplane mode without restarting the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Startup question</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: nothing new here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in Motorola SLVR L9 has no novelties at all. It is the same as in previous Motorola models, meaning that it can show phone and SIM contacts simultaneously, only phone contacts or only SIM ones. Searching is done by gradually typing the first letters of the desired contact?s name. Browsing through the phonebook is one nice thing here: using the ??? and ?#? keys you switch between standard phonebook, emails and categories of contacts. In the phone this options is called filtering and can be very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phonebook list with thumbnails ? choosing the contact?s source ? filtering ? phonebook list without pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you create a new contact, the phone offers you fields for First Name, Last Name, Nickname, Number, Type of number (Mobile, Home, Work, Fax, Pager, Other), Email, Type of email (Personal, Work, Other), URL, Postal address, Type of postal address (Home, Work, Other), Category (General, Business, Personal, VIPs), Ringer ID, Picture, Birthday (does not copy it into the calendar). You can assign lots of numbers to one contact, not only one per type.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Who called and when?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola SLVR L9 has a rather limited calls log but to most people it will serve their needs just fine. It records the last 10 received, dialed and missed calls - 10 per category that is. When browsing the log, you can switch between types of calls using the ??? and ?#? keys. There are four folders ? Dialed, Received, Missed and Recent calls. Data connections are recorded in the log too. You can see when you have a call or data connection (meaning GPRS or EDGE) and what did that cost you (if your operator supports that service, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Dialed Calls ? Call information</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola SLVR L9 has the typical messaging menu as in all Motorola phones lately. All messages, SMS, MMS and EMS are stored in one Message Inbox, only the emails have a separate folder, called Email Msgs. Incoming messages are displayed on 6 lines. This is rather good, almost an entire message can be read on one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Message Center ? Writing a message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editor counts the typed characters but does not alert you when you have passed the limit of 160 characters and the message will be divided in two or more messages. You realize this when you are about to send it, the phone pops up a bubble, telling you how many messages you are about to send.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email application in L9 deserves applause. It supports the most used POP3 and SMTP protocols and handles attachments seamlessly. You can even set a maximum size of the email attachment to be more than 300KB ? something that you don?t see often. Nothing but praises for the way the phone handles emails.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia: not the strongest part of the phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola have some phones with great file managers and picture gallery handling. L9 is just not one of them. Browsing through your pictures can really work on your nerves quite bad. Previewing the thumbnails takes forever to happen probably because the browser loads the whole image in smaller size. Other than that, the phone manages files quite fine, you can also switch between folders (Pictures, Sounds, Videos, Memory card) with the ??? and ?#? keys. If it wasn?t for the very slow response, L9?s file manager would have been among the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Pictures folder ? Viewing a picture in portrait and landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the audio and video player there are few words to say. When it comes to music, the music player handles it well; it can work in background mode and does not slow the phone more than it is already lagging. But if you want to watch a video, this is a completely different story. It takes a few seconds to open the file and then if you switch to fullscreen mode, even the video has some lag and really gets on your nerves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Playing a song ? listening to a song in the background ? a video in portrait ? and in fullscreen mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio of the phone is quite good in fact. Once you plug in the cable for the headphones, which serves as an antenna, you can start the application from the dedicated button on the keypad. It supports RDS and can save stations so working with it is a real pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Listening to radio ? list of preset radio stations</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera in Motorola SLVR L9 with 8x digital zoom is surprisingly weak and lacks a lot of options which are present in most nowadays camera phones. It has none of the usual night mode, panorama, frame shooting and burst shooting mode. Another strange thing is the decision to shoot still images in portrait mode but record video in landscape orientation. If the users want to shoot still images in landscape mode there is always the option to rotate the images to 90 degrees on your PC after transferring them to it. We recommend using lossless JPEG rotation as in our camera samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera viewfinder ? options ? camera setup</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the pictures is below average for a 2 megapixel camera. Not a big surprise for a budget phone. We compared the photos to Motorola RIZR Z3 and the slider won easily. Motorola L9 captures less details and besides this shooting indoors was tricky. It seems that the shutter speed was too low and about half of the photos in the mall came out blurry (we are showing only the good ones in our samples).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>          Motorola L9 sample photos straight from the camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Motorola L9 photos rotated</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice thing to see is the image editor in the phone. In order to edit the picture, though, you must resize it to 300 x 400 pixels resolution. When you have opened an image, you can adjust the brightness, contrast, blur or sharpen the image, rotate it or turn it into a mirror image. You can also put borders or apply different styles on the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Options in the image editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola L9 captures video in CIF resolution, which is not bad at all, considering there are some more expensive phones which still shoot in QCIF resolution (4 times less pixels). Other than that and the different orientation of the view-finder, everything in the application is pretty much the same.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connecting with the world is easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>First, let?s start with connecting to a computer. Since there is a miniUSB port on the handset synchronization is easier than ever. You just have to install the PC Suite which comes in the box and then everything works just fine. You can transfer you contacts, messages and calendar entries to your PC and of course you can transfer files to your phone too. There is also the Mass Storage option which enables you to transfer files like images and sounds without using the PC Suite - just connect the phone via the USB cable and it appears as a storage device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPRS and EDGE are no longer considered a luxury extra on your phone as almost every phone coming out on the market these days supports these high speed data transfer protocols. It?s uncommon though to see them both in class 10 on a budget handset. The only bad thing here is that there is no 3G support. Why have Motorola decided not to implement it, remains a mystery. The last connectivity protocol that the L9 supports is the Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP profile, meaning you can connect a wireless stereo headset. There is no Infrared port which cannot be considered a drawback as it is already a pretty old technology and is rather useless these days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time organizing is all these days<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organization tools in Motorola SLVR L9 are in the Tools folder of the main menu. This sub-menu contains the Calculator, Datebook, Alarm Clock, Dialing Services, Activation List and World Clock. The Calculator is a normal Motorola calculator and works just fine. It is not a complex one, just the basic operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Tools menu ? Calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Datebook is actually the Calendar. It can be viewed in monthly, weekly and daily view. There is also a filter to see only the Organized events, showing you the upcoming events this week, next week and the unfiled events. This is a good option and it would be nice to see it in more phones. You can create an Event and set its Subject, Location, Type (Personal, Meeting, Appointment, Birthday, Anniversary, Phone Call, Vacation, Holiday, Entertainment, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Education, Travel or Party; this may be a bit too much of categorization?), Start Time, End Time, Start Date, End Date, Reminder and Notes. You can also set whether the event will go on during the whole day or not. There are repeat options to set when you want the same event to occur again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Datebook views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock application is working alright but there is one big fault here. There are no repetition options. You can set many alarms with different times and type of alerting but you cannot set a repeating alarm. A good thing is that you can put a name on the alarm so you could easily orientate what the phone is alerting you of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Alarm details and list of alarms</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock application shows you the exact time in different time zones of the world. Voice recording application can also fit in the category of organization tools. It works pretty well and the only limit of recording is the free memory. It can be accessed by a long press on the key on the left side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    World Clock with digital and analog clocks ? displaying a graph of the current time zone selected ? recording sound</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One very disturbing issue is the lack of Notes application. There is no way you can write notes to yourself or save some important information without having to write a message and store it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet is crucial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated web browser in the phone works ok but only if you browse WAP pages. As we found opening complex HTML pages such as GSMArena.com is not among its strongest sides. You might want to install an additional browser as the phone supports Java applications. Opera Mini is a good choice and you will find no difficulties with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Googling with L9 ? the browser fails to open GSMArena.com</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Additional applications and games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s first start with the Digital Audio Player which can be found in the Games &amp; Apps sub-menu. It is a Java application and by our opinion does nothing more than the default player. The only difference is that you can filter tracks in a number of ways ? by track names, album, artist or genre. There are also Shuffle and Repeat options, but regrettably the player cannot work in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Digital Audio Player by Motorola ? the main menu of the player ? Now Playing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a lot of games preinstalled on the phone but we doubt that all of them are going to be in the market version of the device. Lumines, Midnight Pool, Mystery Mansion, Platinum Sudoku and Splinter Cell were preinstalled on the phone. The first is some tetris-like game. The Midnight Pool is a pretty basic billiards game. The Mystery Mansion is a flipper game. You all know what the Sudoku puzzles are and the Splinter Cell is a popular hit-and-run type of game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Asphalt Urban GT ? Lumines ? Midnight Pool ? Mystery Mansion ? Sudoku ? Splinter Cell</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Depends on the price<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone surely impressed our team in a number of ways - regrettably most of which negative. The slow menu speed, the lack of 3G, Notes application and any significant improvements over L7 and L7e made us very skeptical on its market success. There were also good aspects like the great construction and attractive design, but there are not much differences compared to the L7 and L7e model and thus this handset must have a low starting price in order to attract new fans.</paragraph>
