		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LTE-packing Motorola Atrix HD for AT&amp;T faces a couple of hard challenges. First and foremost, it has to build on the user experience of original Atrix 4G, giving its owners who are up for an upgrade these days, a reason to stick with the brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not going to be easy, considering the iconic status that the Atrix 4G had for Motorola. Announced as one of the brightest stars of CES 2011, the Atrix 4G developed a solid following and for a good reason - it was one of the very first proper dual-core Android powerhouses, whose finger scanner added an extra dash of massive geeky coolness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the Atrix HD will try to appeal to all Motorola fans in the United States who were not given the chance to own a GSM flavored, subsidized Motorola RAZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now that we have the smartphone's family history out of the way, let's take a closer look at its specifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite frankly, we were caught by surprise when AT&amp;T and Motorola announced the Atrix HD. For a smartphone whose specs are so impressive, the arrival of the latest member of the Atrix family as well as Motorola's most powerful handset on the US market, was a seriously low key affair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the lists above, the Motorola Atrix HD is one the best equipped smartphones currently on the market. You will be hard pressed to find much to frown about in its specs sheet - it screams flagship from beginning to end. And then there's the fact that the smartphone is priced lower than its direct rivals to sweeten up the deal even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Atrix HD is not without its faults, though. We can't help but be skeptical about the size of the handset's battery. Its 1780mAh capacity is nothing to write home about, especially when put in a device manufactured by the company which gave the world the RAZR MAXX. The design could have also been a bit more inspiring, but that might be just us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Motorola Atrix HD is one of the most interesting smartphones we've welcomed in our office recently. We are hoping that its real-life performance can maintain the good impressions that its specs sheet creates. As always, we'll kick its review off with an unboxing of the handset, followed by a look at its design and build quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Motorola Atrix HD for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most smartphones offered by AT&amp;T, the Motorola Atrix HD offers a rather modest retail package. In the carrier branded box, you will find a charger and a microUSB cable to go with the usual set of booklets. The headset prayers were once again left unanswered and there's no microSD card to be found, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time however the retail box and its contents are at least reflected in the device's price tag, so we won't be deducing as many points as usual.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD looks much like a Motorola RAZR that has its buttons below replaced with virtual ones. In fact, if it wasn't for the slightly rounder edges, the AT&amp;T smartphone would easily be mistaken for a member of the RAZR family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our main grudge here is with the placement of the AT&amp;T logo. It looks out of place below the screen and can be mistaken for a capacitive button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the smartphone is phenomenal. The Motorola Atrix HD is a blend of Kevlar and Corning Gorilla Glass. The amount of plastic used in the construction is small and even that seems to be of really high quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dimensions of the smartphone are 133.5 x 69.9 x 8.4 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 140 grams. The Motorola Atrix HD is hardly one of the lightest devices you will encounter, but you couldn't realistically expect a with a 4.55" screen to be much more compact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the smartphone is one of its strongest features. The 4.55" LCD unit of 720p resolution uses an RGB matrix and Motorola's ColorBoost technology. These numbers add up to a pixel density of 326 ppi, which as good as it gets really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is also seriously bright and offers good sunlight legibility. The RAZR family and its PenTile AMOLEDs were certainly good, but we certainly prefer the screen Motorola went with this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will find the earpiece, the usual set of sensors, as well as the 1.3MP front-facing camera. Below the screen is where the mouthpiece and AT&amp;T logo reside. We already told you how we feel about the latter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD and microSIM card slots are hidden under a cover on the left side of the device. On the right, you have the power/lock key and the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Atrix HD is home of the microUSB and microHDMI slots, as well as the 3.5mm audio jack. There is absolutely nothing on the bottom of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kevlar covered back of the device is where the 8MP main camera and its LED flash can be found. They are located on the very RAZR-like chin on the top of the Atrix HD's back. The loudspeaker grille is located right next to them. There is a secondary mic on the bottom part of the handset's back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1780mAh battery is non-removable. It powered the Motorola Atrix HD to the uninspiring endurance rating of 36 hours in our traditional battery test. This means that you will need to charge your device every 36 if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web-browsing and video playback every day. Find more on our testing procedures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Atrix HD battery test scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD handles easily for its size. The Kevlar coated back of the device has a soft-touch feeling to it. It is also quite grippy, so unwanted accidents are not likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD deserves high marks for its craftsmanship. It feels a lot more upmarket than its price tag suggests. Design could have been more inspiring, but it is a matter of personal preference. Besides, that gorgeous screen is surely going to keep your attention from the looks of the phone. As for the retail package of the handset - it is hardly a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the software of the Motorola Atrix HD, as well as its performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with a dash of Motorola<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, which has been lightly customized by Motorola. The overall Android experience feels like one with a stock UI in more than one occasion - starting from the on-screen Android buttons, all the way to the app drawer and its transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the handset in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first part the interface which has been customized by Motorola is the lock screen. Pressing the unlock button gives you four shortcus - you can simply unlock the smartphone, or go straight to telephony, text messaging or the camera apps. You can also turn the device's sound on and off from the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of side-scrollable panes. There's a small indicator above the docked icons, which disappears when not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding or removing a homescreen pane, you have two options - start with a blank or use a preset one. The preset ones are geared towards specific activities such as social networking, entertainment, or managing your AT&amp;T services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing homescreen panes is as easy as swiping them upwards. No surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a true Ice Cream Sandwich fashion, long pressing the homescreen gives you the option to change the handset's wallpapers. You can do so for both the lock and the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has been taken straight from the stock version of Android ICS. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets, each of which consists of several side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you move into the Widgets tab. There's also a Google Play store shortcut next to the tabs, for quicker access to Android's official app repository.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create folders in the familiar ICS way. All you have to do is swipe the icon over the one you want to pair it with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren't too many preloaded widgets. However, Motorola's own Circles widget is one of the most comfortable ones we've encountered. It offers you access to the clock, weather in different cities, as well as a battery indicator in a customizable shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of its homescreen customizations, the Motorola Atrix HD allows you to access the logs of some of the most commonly used applications. They include the web browser, the messaging app, the Motorola email app, the telephony, as well as the phone book. We found this feature to be particularly handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is taken straight from the stock ICS UI. It shows you icons next to the notification, such as the picture of the person who called or messaged you. There's a Settings shortcut to make up for the fact that you can't go Menu &gt; Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall user interface experience with the Motorola Atrix HD is quite pleasant. The UI has been customized lightly, but cleverly. This helps it retain a lot of pure Googleness to it - not a bad thing in our opinion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset of the Motorola Atrix HD is the same as the one found in any top shelf device currently on the US market, including the Galaxy S III and the HTC One X. Having the same silicon as its competition shows in the benchmark scores as well, as the Atrix HD offers performance on par with the competition.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock phonebook with Yellow Pages functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Motorola Atrix HD is mostly a standard Android ICS affair. The only addition to it is the Yellow Pages integration, which allows you to search businesses and people in the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The middle tab is the default one and it's where your contacts are listed. Contacts get displayed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with the first or last name first. The other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbs friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and drag to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's a regular search field, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any issues with the signal and call quality of the Motorola Atrix HD. As expected, the phone did a commendable job on this instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is enabled on the handset, which is great as it saves you the effort of going into your phonebook to find a contact. It shows only one matching contact at a time - you can use the down arrow to reveal the other suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recent calls tab is straightforward in terms of functionality. The favorites tab is neat, as it allows you to dial the contacts with a single tap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is brimming with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messaging is a pretty standard ICS affair. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. You can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, with the latest messages at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are presented with two text input options out of the box. The first one is the standard Android ICS keyboard which is really good. The popular Swype keyboard is also preinstalled. In case these two don't cut it for you, the Google Play store is full of options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD is equipped with a stock Android ICS gallery. The Default view of the gallery is Albums - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, which are two per line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above each photo you have several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more option. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock video player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of the Atrix HD is the stock Android one. It supports most popular video formats such as XviD and MKV. You can access the videos straight from the gallery app - there's no dedicated video player button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the Motorola Atrix HD (as the name suggests) is perfect for consumption of video content. Large files are also handled easily by the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD comes with the latest Music app by Google. It has the same side-scrollable tabs like much of the other stuff in Ice Cream Sandwich. Naturally, it offers a link to the Google Play music store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are used to organize your music library - there's Recent, Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features the track's album art with the track info and playback controls below it. You can tap it to reveal more options - like/unlike the song, a bar to scrub through the song and shuffle and repeat toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD fared pretty well in our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone offers pretty good frequency response as well as excellent signal-to-noise and dynamic range scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk is quite good as well, while the distortion levels are kept well under control. Add the excellent volume levels and you get a really solid overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD is equipped with an 8MP camera which takes photos with a maximum resolution of 3264x2448 pixels. It's accompanied by a single-LED flash to help out in low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is simple. On the right side of the viewfinder there's the virtual shutter key flanked by the front/back and photo/video toggles. On the left, there's the gallery shortcut that displays the thumbnail of the last photo taken (with a counter of remaining photos next to it) and the digital zoom slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a retractable row of shortcuts at the bottom - those include effects, scenes, shooting mode, exposure adjustment and flash control (on, off, auto).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From Modes, you can choose single shot, multi-shot (4MP photos), panorama or self-timer. Scenes offer things like Sport, Macro or an Auto mode that decides what's best without your explicit input. There's an option to geotag photos - that info can be stripped automatically when sharing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a widescreen option that produces 16:9 photos. With it, both the viewfinder and the gallery images fit the screen aspect perfectly in full screen mode. However, the 16:9 aspect ratio means the photos turn out at roughly three quarters of the original resolution at about 6MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures which the Atrix HD captures offer a good amount of detail. Colors look slightly off, but generally pleasing. The dynamic range is rather limited and we also noticed higher than average noise in areas with shadows. Check out the samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD shoots 1080p videos at 30fps. The user interface looks identical to that of the still camera although some options have been changed. The Scenes option from the still camera has been replaced by Audio Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Stereo, Wind Reduction, Concert, Balanced and Front Facing audio scenes, which use the two microphones to adapt the audio to the specific situation. You still have the effects and exposure options and you can enable video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in .MP4 files with bitrate hovering at 15Mbps. The sound that goes along with the video is stereo (128Kbps bitrate, 44.1kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured by the Atrix HD came out with decent amount of detail and nice colors, though we've seen better. Much like with the still camera, the videos suffered from limited dynamic range. There was also visible fringing on some occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of samples captured with the Atrix HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched 1080p video clip.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has you covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like a proper top shelf Android smartphone, the Motorola Atrix HD checks just about every box on the connectivity list. It offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band HSDPA potentially reaching speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA, and 5.76 HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, AT&amp;T's superb LTE network connectivity is also on board. Where available, it is a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity features include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (with DLNA support) and Bluetooth 4.0 with LE. The mobile hotspot functionality is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for wired connectivity, there's a microUSB port and a microHDMI port. Using an appropriate HDMI cable (not included in the retail box), you can hook up the Atrix HD to an HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD comes with a MOTOPRINT app that makes it easy to connect to a printer on the local Wi-Fi network and print all sorts of Office docs, PDFs, emails, calendar entries and contact info. All you have to do is find the printer (there is an automatic search, manual search, search in the homegroup and other options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curiously, the smartphone does not support NFC or connectivity to Motorola's lapdocks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In case you don't want to take the leap to Google's own Chrome browser for Android, the Motorola Atrix HD comes with a stock ICS browser on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser UI is quite minimalistic - you get the URL bar with a tabs shortcut and the "more" button which brings up several more options. They include Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search provider to be Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Inverted screen rendering option, which turns the web page black and white (with white backgrounds becoming black). You can tweak this effect using the Contrast slider. This option is under the Accessibility menu and makes pages easier to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result (and with Google's algorithms there's a good chance you will), it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Incognito mode is on board too - it's not a global setting, but lets you open individual Incognito tabs, which we find to be the more convenient solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser (still) supports Flash and, thanks to all that computing power inside, you can even watch embedded 1080p videos straight within the web browser. Paying Flash games is great too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top notch organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is an excellent app that has support for viewing several file types - Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF. It can also edit and create new .DOC, .XLS and .PPT files (both 2003 and 2007 versions are supported). You have plenty of formatting options, inserting images, Excel formulas and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app defaults to a desk clock mode that looks a lot like the lockscreen. The best part here is that you can tap to turn the light almost all the way down - with only the time staying on the display just bright enough to see it (it's much easier to see in the dark). This is a very power-efficient mode and you can actually use the phone as a desk clock without worrying about killing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present - you can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat pattern, ringtone and label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a file manager on board as well - it can browse both the internal 16GB memory and the microSD card. Also, there's support for browsing shared folders on the Wi-Fi network you're connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a really clever app called Smart Actions - it allows you to create automatic actions triggered by different conditions you set. You can have the phone do various things (e.g. disable background sync, change screen brightness, display a notification to remind you of something, etc.). There are several sample actions that are useful in various situations but you can create your own from scratch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and some surrounding area before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with applications and video games, you can also access and purchase movies, music, books and magazines (where available).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vehicle mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD offers vehicle mode as well. Used when attaching the phone to a car dock, it changes the screen's layout to landscape and offers large and easy to access buttons for the most commonly used features such as telephony, maps, music, etc. You can customize several shortcuts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Powerful internals, gorgeous screen, solidly built body, and a stock Android experience with just the right amount of modification -that's the Motorola Atrix HD in a nutshell. Motorola has addressed the issues of the smartphone's predecessors, thus creating one of the most complete Android packages currently on the US market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's really quite a lot to love about the Motorola Atrix HD and very few things to frown at. Naturally, we really wish the handset offered a larger battery - its 1780mAh unit is unable to match the endurance of the other high-end offerings out there. The fact that it's not user replaceable makes matters worse as you can't carry a spare one when needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is also a bit smaller than those of some of its rivals and the difference grows even more when you consider that a part of it is reserved for the virtual buttons. Finally, both of Motorola's direct rivals - HTC and Samsung have better records when it comes to updating their smartphones. The Atrix HD can match them now when the game is ICS, but it's unclear if it will join them in the JB camp quickly enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But those are all minor things that most of you can probably live with. Even more so when you learn that Motorola and AT&amp;T have priced the Atrix HD at the sweet $99.99 with a two-year contract. As we see it this gives you a great chance of snatching a top shelf smartphone for mid-ranger money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you are willing to shop around, here are some other options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T is currently priced like the Atrix HD at $99.99. It will give you a larger HD screen and a bigger battery to take care of it, but lacks expandable memory. If that's not an issue to you, the flagship of the Taiwanese company and its sweet polycarbonate body is definitely worth a look.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You might also want to take a look at the HTC One S for T-Mobile and the HTC DROID Incredible 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless. Both devices are equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 silicon and offer 4.3" AMOLED displays (but also dedicated buttons so no need for virtual buttons to eat into it). Their screen resolution however is lower and they are priced higher than the Motorola Atrix HD at $149.99.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you are willing to splash some more cash upfront, you are entering the realm of the Samsung Galaxy S III and the HTC Evo 4G LTE. Both devices are proper Android heavyweights, leaving no box unchecked on their spec sheets. They bring larger screens and bigger batteries than the Atrix HD. In the case of the Galaxy S III, the battery is also user-replaceable, which gives you even more flexibility. If money is no issue, check these two out.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Atrix HD is a really solid effort by Motorola and we doubt anyone will end up regretting the purchase of this smartphone. It offers you flagship user experience and an answer to the fierce competition in its lower price tag. This is one of the easiest smartphones to recommend and we really hope Moto takes good care of it, by supplying it its due Jelly Bean serving in a timely manner.</paragraph>
