			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G is aimed primarily at commitment-challenged consumers. Being one of the quickest product sequels we?ve seen in a while, the device is marketed mostly as a Pay as you go phone, which offers you the full Android functionality at the affordable price of $200 with no contract required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being only the fourth largest wireless provider in the United States, T-Mobile has always positioned itself as the budget alternative to its significantly larger competitors. This year, the magenta colored provider has become even more aggressive in its pricing by offering all-you-can-eat monthly plans, which require no contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the device looks somewhat familiar to you, you?ve probably guessed it right. The Exhibit II 4G is essentially the U.S. version of the Samsung Galaxy W. In order to fit its attractive price tag however, some of its hardware has been replaced with less capable options. The CPU of the Exhibit II is a 1GHz Snapdragon, compared to the 1.4 GHz Scorpion core of the Galaxy W. Its camera unit on the other hand, comes straight from 2008 with its 3.2MP resolution and VGA video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we will follow with the full breakdown of the Samsung Exhibit II 4G by going over its key features and main disadvantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can notice above, the Samsung Exhibit II 4G will certainly not end up on your list of dream phones. It is not aiming for it though. With a decent spec sheet and software which comes straight from the top of the Samsung Android ranks, paired with a low price tag with non contract, the smartphone makes quite a lot of sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will kick things off with unboxing of the Exhibit II 4G, followed by a hardware inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Exhibit II 4G for T-Mobile is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare bones retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Samsung Exhibit II 4G is as budget oriented as the phone itself. Despite the large size of the box, all you are going to find inside is a charger and a USB cable to go with the phone. Yup, no headphones here, not even a microSD card. And yes, the phone is that cheap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G is certainly not a celebration of industrial design. With its dark color scheme, the device looks downright dull. The lack of any signs or logos at its front gives the impression that you are looking at a cheap Chinese knockoff. It is regrettable that the pleasant design of the Galaxy W was not implemented here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is actually much better looking than its front. The dark blue battery cover has a nice looking texture to it and the tiny metal bezel around the camera unit gives you some sort of upmarket feel if you look at it for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With measures of 115 x 60 x 11mm and 116 grams of weight the Samsung Exhibit II 4G is an extremely pocket friendly device. Despite its all plastic construction, it is well put together ? it looks like it can take quite a lot of use and abuse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.7? LCD screen does an adequate job. Sure, it isn?t a Super AMOLED but, at this price range, it will be difficult to find one anyway. We found the screen to have good viewing angles and better sunlight legibility than some a lot more upscale competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen of the device you will find the typical for all Samsung Android smartphones in the U.S., four touch sensitive buttons. Above the screen is the earpiece, the front-facing camera unit, ambient light and proximity sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the device, you will find the lonely volume rocker. The power/lock key is on the right. Again, there is no dedicated camera button present but, since we?re talking 3.2MP unit, the lack is much easier to get over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unprotected 3.5 mm audio jack is on top of the Exhibit II 4G. Right next to it is the microUSB port, which is used for charging as well. This one has a neat sliding cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the device, you will find the mouthpiece and the tiny latch to open the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the rest of the phone, its back looks busy. There, you will find the 3.2MP snapper with its LED flash and the loudspeaker grille. A duo of Samsung and T-Mobile logos complete the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the battery cover is a typical sight. There is a SIM card slot, and a hot-swappable microSD slot at the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1500 mAh battery of the Exhibit II 4G made it easily through a full day of use and abuse. The latter included about an hour of phone calls, music play, video game play, email and web browsing. We found nothing to complain here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Exhibit II 4G handles very nicely. The textured plastic on the back prevents accidental drops and feels sturdy ? unlike the one used on its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We only wished that the phone was more pleasant to look at. Even for a low cost device, the Exhibit II is way too far from being good looking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface: Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread and TouchWiz 4.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G makes up for its lack of looks in its software department. With the latest Gingerbread version and the most recent TouchWiz launcher on board, you will be looking at a Galaxy S II experience for about a third of the budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the device in action. Check it out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes in TouchWiz 4.0, compared to its previous versions, begin at the very lock screen, which you can now remove by swiping in any direction, rather than just sideways. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is still here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen got plenty of tweaks too. You get rectangular design for the widgets and a lot of functionality. The process of adding widgets is visually enhanced too with attractive transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual ? you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregate view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is improved as well. You can now create folders inside it (though given that folders are enabled on the homescreen we don?t see much use for that here). Different view types are available for you to choose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange the app panels within the launcher in a similar fashion as the homescreen ones. A pinch gesture lays them out in front you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is pretty easy stuff ? in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, but there aren?t any major changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager, which Samsung has preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. With the Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn?t hurt having it. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications straight on your homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a single core Snapdragon CPU, clocked at 1GHz, the Samsung Exhibit II 4G is certainly not a benchmark ninja. In any case, we have compiled several for you to give you an idea of its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see above, the performance of the device is in line with the similarly equipped alternatives out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our experience with the Exhibit II, we found a considerable amount of lag in its UI. Since this is our first experience of TouchWiz 4.0 on a single-core Samsung, we believe that the latest launcher offers a much better experience with an extra core at play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is great, as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you?ve created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too ? swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too. If you don?t need that, you can still opt for the phonebook to augment your existing contacts info with stuff downloaded from the social network cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard ? one displays the person?s contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff ? status updates and the contact?s online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is up to snuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II had great in-call quality - the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn?t suffer dropped calls. The superb T-Mobile coverage in New York City?s area contributed to this fact as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi calling adds an extra touch of functionality to the telephony of the Exhibit II 4G. For $10 a month, you can enjoy it with no limit. Given the unlimited talk plans which T-Mobile offers however, we don?t see its necessity unless you have reception issues in your home or office.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger ? as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. Video chat support is also on board here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as Swype. Both virtual QWERTYs have proven to be easy to use. More options can be found in the Android Market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browsers are at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two-finger tilt zoom works much like the name suggests. You touch the screen with two fingers and as soon as you start tilting it, it will zoom in or out according to the tilting motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is capable as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (adjust them back or forth a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera is nice for a snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II comes with a 3.2MP camera with an LED flash. Its interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is needless to say that 3.2MP resolution is far from impressive these days. But truth be told, we've seen 5 megapixel cameras deliver poorer results than those of the Exhibit II 4G. The images produced by the phone are actually really nice for a 3MP snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared several samples for you. See them below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording can, again, turn out a nice VGA clip<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The video camera can record video using the front facing camera too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The VGA resolution of the camera sounds inadequate for a 2011/2012 smartphone, but the Exhibit II 4G is a budget device. And the VGA videos turn out really nice contrary to what we've seen on other budget droids back in Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched VGA video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is abundant with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II for T-Mobile starts off with the basics ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G. There?s HSPA+ with 14.4 Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which T-Mobile brands as ?4G? even though it?s technically not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there?s Bluetooth 3.0 and Wi-Fi support, which includes a/b/g/n protocols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is sweet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed. Its user experience is, as always, flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum ? that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There are a couple of Samsung Hubs preinstalled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we?ve seen before ? it combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Hub lets you buy or rent movies or TV shows. Its interface is neat and intuitive, while its setup will take you no time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You are fully covered in the office department<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II for T-Mobile comes with the Polaris Office preinstalled, which seems to be getting rather popular with hardware manufacturers lately. And for good reason, we guess ? it?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer as well. The app allows you to search for your office files just like with a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer is flawless<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps is essential<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After its recent major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go not only for apps and media, but also book, movies, etc. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must note that, in the case of the Samsung Exhibit II 4G, the wireless provider has gone out of its way in putting all kinds of proprietary apps, whose usability hovers around the absolute zero. Having them on board clutters the phone?s launcher and takes away from its resources for no good reason.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kies Air turns your phone into a web server<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer?s web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone ? from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who?s connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G is one of the most unpretentious phone we?ve seen this year. Its dull looks do it no justice as software-wise, the device is identical to the current Galaxy S II lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did find the device a bit laggy at times while putting the TouchWiz launcher to its paces. It appears that the latest incarnation of it is suited much better for dual-core smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G costs the highly acceptable $199.99 without any contract commitment. T-Mobile offers a slew of pay as you go plans for it, including a $30 a month one, which is offered in partnership with Walmart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You must look really hard to find similar functionality for this kind of money. As always, we did some research and have found a couple of alternatives. Just keep in mind that this time, we are talking only contract-free prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 is the most viable alternative we could find. The Symbian device costs $229.99 online, and offers an impressive set of features for its price tag. Among them is a clear black AMOLED screen, 8MP camera and a metal clad body. If you are not stuck on Android, you will surely like this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Sony Ericsson Xperia mini can also be found in the $200-dollar price range. The smartphone packs an impressive spec sheet, and trounces the Exhibit II in terms of looks. It will not however, support T-Mobile?s speedy HSDPA network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Xperia mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Exhibit II 4G?s main goal is to bring people into the T-Mobile fold by offering them access to the Magenta?s ?4G? network and affordable plans, at an acceptable price. In this aspect, it has no alternative in terms of functionality and price. If this is what you are after, it will do the job for you. Otherwise, it is a tough sell.</paragraph>
