			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L is trying to break into an already well-populated market of affordable smartphones that give you a loud bang for your buck. It's a hotly contested game, but the neo L doesn't come unprepared. It has Sony's screen and camera know-how behind its back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L is the second revision of the neo design. The biggest change is the screen, which grew to 4 inches, and the OS - the L model launches with Android 4.0 ICS out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some other changes visible on the outside - Sony decided to drop the HDMI port, there are now four hardware buttons under the screen and the hardware shutter key is missing, but that's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the inside, things are more familiar - the Sony Xperia neo L is based on the same platform as quite a few Sony Ericsson phones - the previous two neos, the Xperia arc, mini, ray, PLAY and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Froyo times these were flagship specs and when Gingerbread came out, they were relocated to midrange territory. Today, they are even lower than that but the neo L has a couple of aces up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dual-core processor might put some people off, but it's really the HDMI port that we miss. It's a real rarity, especially since manufacturers started using MHL instead, but that requires an adapter and it's usually only the higher-end devices that get it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there have been a few omissions, but the Xperia neo L still has quality components like that Reality display and Android Ice Cream Sandwich (a lot of former high-enders and even current models are still - and might remain forever - on Gingerbread).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jump to the next page where we start to find out just how much Sony heart went into what looks like a Sony Ericsson body.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L comes in a compact box accommodating the handset itself and the usual set of accessories. Those include a USB charger, a microUSB-to-USB cable (used for both charging and data connections) and a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are a couple of user guides in the box and a 2GB microSD card already in the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia neo L 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Sony Xperia neo L has grown larger compared to the previous two neos to accommodate the bigger screen. The Xperia neo L measures 121 x 61.1 x 12.2 mm and weighs 131.5g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo L looks like the first phone Sony made after the split with Ericsson. You know, for old times' sake. And while a certain charm is hard to deny, it's pretty obvious that the good-looking phones are in the NXT line. The Sony Xperia neo L is a cure for nostalgia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the phone's front is taken by a 4" 16M-color LCD screen of FWVGA resolution (854 x 480 pixels). The neo L uses a similar spec'd display to many of its recent Xperia line siblings, but unlike them lacks the Sony Bravia Mobile Engine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED-backlit LCD has pleasing colors and contrast. The questionable feature is viewing angles: contrast quickly deteriorates and the colors get washed out when viewing the screen at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum brightness of the screen isn't very high and the sunlight legibility falls somewhat short too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary display test confirmed that the Sony Xperia neo L has good contrast, though it's not very bright. Notably, it's dimmer than the neo V screen. Black levels are great though even when you consider higher end phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the usual earpiece, proximity and ambient light sensors and the VGA front-facing camera. The front cam is a lot less prominent than on the previous Sony Ericsson neos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is an old-school set of hardware controls: Back, Home, Menu and Search buttons. The buttons are thin and small, and not all that easy to use. You'll sometimes hit the Menu key when you really wanted the Home key. We have another complaint too - the keys are quite wobbly, giving them a cheap feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left hand side of the Xperia neo L features the microUSB port, which handles charging and PC connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right are the Power/Lock key and the volume rocker, both of which are placed on the sloping side and have a shallow press, which is quite uncomfortable. The lanyard eyelet on this side too. There used to be a hardware shutter key as well, but Sony has decided to go virtual-only with the neo L.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the phone features a 3.5mm audio jack that juts out from the curved top side of the handset. A tiny notification/charger light is off to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mic pinhole is at the bottom of the phone along with a small groove you can use to lift the back cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Xperia neo L breaks from the tradition of placing the camera near the center. The 5MP shooter and its LED flash companion are positioned closer to the top, near the loudspeaker grill. The creaky back panel (especially the lower end) makes a terrible impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the glossy plastic back cover is the 1500mAh Li-Po battery. It blocks access to the SIM card and microSD slots, which are stacked one above the other. We can't help but think that rotating the microSD slot 90 degrees so that it isn't blocked by the battery would have enabled hot-swapping and couldn't have been a major redesign issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't run our usual battery test as the video codec support was poor and we couldn't use our usual test videos. We did do a talk time and browsing time tests though, the results from which you can find in telephony and web browser sections of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it isn't the most compact phone, the Sony Xperia neo L is still pocketable and the curved sides improve the feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exterior of the phone is mostly built from glossy plastic (black or white), which is an instant fingerprint magnet. The metallic silver strip that runs around the circumference of the phone does class up the place a bit and the metal mesh of the loudspeaker on the back looks kind of cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong - it's a nice piece of hardware, but the Xperia neo L feels like a lower-end device compared to the neo V.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's it for the hardware, it's time to look at the software. We had to triple check, but the Sony Xperia neo L is the first Xperia that's running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich at the time we're reviewing it (as opposed to getting the ICS treatment as an update). About time, Sony.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia gets Ice Cream Sandwich<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box but it's still covered head to toe by the custom skin that Sony usually use and the interface doesn't feel too different. If you have one of those Xperias that started life with Gingerbread but got promoted to ICS, you'll feel right at home with the neo L.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we've shot the user interface on video for your viewing pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo L has the usual five-pane homescreen configuration, but there is no option to add or remove panes. There are four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). These are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of folders, one of the differences is that they're now displayed a bit differently - they show thumbnails of the first four items in them. Not a major change, but gives you quick peek of what's inside the folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All active widgets gather there for easy viewing and selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo L has some custom-made Sony widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new addition to the lockscreen, missing from the Xperia phones of old, is the music player widget, which lets you control music playback without unlocking the phone. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for - no custom touches to them. For some reason the notification area isn't accessible from the lockscreen as it usually is on ICS (and on other ICS-running Xperia phones).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon chipset, which packs a 1GHz Scorpion core, 512MB of RAM and Adreno 205 GPU. That's no longer the pinnacle of mobile phone hardware, so we didn't expect miracles here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU performance is mostly unchanged compared to the neo V. It's better than lower-clocked Cortex-A5 designs used by some of the neo L's competition, but an Xperia U blows it out of the water.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 205 GPU is an old design and WVGA resolution pushes it to its limit. Still, with a NenaMark 2 result of about 26fps, the Xperia neo L should do okay in casual 3D games, but don't expect the new 3D shooters to work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing performance turned out pretty good and it can improve further if you use Chrome instead of the stock Android browser (which isn't an option on phones that are still running Gingerbread).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L held its own against NovaThor-powered dual-cores like the Xperia U and the Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 in terms of JavaScript performance. The Xperia U pulled ahead in overall browser performance, but the lower clock speed of the Ace 2 put it on par with the neo L.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The visually customized phonebook of the Xperia neo L is virtually the same as the Xperia sola's and can store extensive contact information. A tabbed interface allows you to access contact details, recent calls and info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (you can fine-sift specific groups from an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), there's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia neo L was trouble-free. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo L phone app features smart dialing. It searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. There's voice dialing too (the quickest way to activate it is to press and hold the hardware Search key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Xperia neo L automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list. You can hide the keypad the make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia neo L. Scoring a Good result, the Xperia neo L performed better than its newer siblings. More info on our loudspeaker test can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a 3G network, the Sony Xperia neo L has enough juice for 7 hours and 41 minutes of talk time. That's actually half an hour better than the officially advertised talk time, but an hour less than what the neo V achieved.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is business as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard threaded layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that as well. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia neo L offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently sized keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It works the same as Swype. Even if you've never used Swype input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two galleries to do one job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo L comes with the Ice Cream Sandwich gallery, but you'll also find the so-called Xperia Gallery, which brings back the good old Gingerbread app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Xperia Gallery, the different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which expand into neat grids of photos sorted by date. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Picasa albums are distinguished by the small logo of the corresponding service. Facebook pictures can be "liked" with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose the native Gallery app, you'll find a similar arrangement by default - images sorted into albums. However, you can group photos by other attributes too (location, time, people and tags are the other available options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing individual images with this gallery app, you get a filmstrip of thumbnails at the bottom of the screen, which can be used to quickly jump between images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images in both galleries can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps would normally lead to artifacts, but you'll have to look from really up close to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia neo L and the phone has limited video playback support as a whole. We only really managed to get MP4 files to play and ran into plenty of issues with large files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on which of the two players you choose to use (there are two galleries and two video players), you get access to a simple video editor that can trim the start and end points of a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download a video player off the Google Play Store with support for more video codecs but chances of getting an HD video (one not shot with the phone itself) to play are pretty slim.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player missed the update<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L uses the old music player - the one used before the NXT series. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you'll get a search shortcut, as well as send and delete options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key. The latter lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the selection of equalizer presets but there's no customizable preset. You also get Silent mode, which mutes all other sounds except for alarms - great for uninterrupted listening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the rest of the music player is the same as what we saw on the neo V, this one adds music controls to the lockscreen. They replace the clock, which might be annoying if you just want to check the time. Still, the clock slides out of view, so you have about a second to see what time it is (or just look at the small clock in the upper right corner).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L lacks FM radio support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is quiet but perfectly clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L fared did great in our audio quality test. It's volume levels were below average in both testing scenarios, but the audio output was almost perfectly clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>. When connected to an active external amplifier, the Sony Xperia neo L got excellent scores all over the field. There were no weak points to its performance so, the volume levels aside, it's as good as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when headphones come into play consists of rather small hikes in stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion. None of the readings should cause any concerns however, so it's an excellent overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see them for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera with stock Android interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo L boasts a 5 megapixel camera with a single LED flash. It's capable of producing stills of 2592 x 1944 resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pure Android Ice Cream Sandwich rather than the bespoke Xperia interface. We are not the biggest fans of it and it lacks some of the fancy functions and streamlined interface of custom camera apps, but it covers everything a casual user would need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder takes up most of the screen, with a panel to the right of it for some of the controls: the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken), the virtual shutter key and the camera mode switch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the controls are overlaid on the right side of the viewfinder. By default, you only see the front/back camera toggle and a shortcut that brings out more controls. The extra controls are semitransparent, so you can keep them on if you like, they won't block your view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Xperia neo L camera lets you customize is the LED flash mode (on, off, auto), white balance, exposure compensation, scene (auto, action, night), geotagging and focus mode. You can choose between three focus modes - auto, infinity and macro. Tap focus and face detection are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap the Gallery shortcut it opens a preview of the last photo taken with a list of all ways to share it and another shortcut to get into the regular gallery mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas are easy to shoot - you just hit the shutter key and start panning left or right, the phone will take care of the rest. The phone will warn you if you're panning too fast. When you're done, it takes several seconds to create the panorama afterwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is very good for the class and it shows an improvement over the neo V. There's less noise to deal with, so there's a good amount of fine detail in the shots though noise reduction is still visible in complex areas (e.g. foliage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color and contrast are good as is exposure, though photos look oversharpened and the stock Android camera offers no option to reduce the sharpening.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard test shots from the Xperia neo L are in our Photo Compare Tool database. The synthetic resolution chart shows average results. The oversharpening haloes are pretty easy to spot here. The noise reduction has smeared the grass and gravel in the second chart, but they are still recognizable. The third chart has accurate white balance and good colors under artificial lighting.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Okay video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L captures 720p video at 30 fps, which is all we can expect out of a single-core processor and a 5MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has the same interface as the still camera and some of the same settings. You can use the LED as a video light, adjust white balance and geotagging. You can also choose to shoot in SD resolution (480p) or do a time lapse video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo L camcorder features continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeating attempts to lock focus that may ruin a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a bitrate of 6Mbps and stereo AAC sound (130Kbps, 38kHz). The overall bitrate isn't enough for 720p though, and the amount of captured detail is sub par for HD video. On the up side, the framerate is a smooth 30fps and there are no issues with constant autofocus as we've seen on some phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched sample 720p@30fps (0:16s, 12MB), taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can have a closer look at the video quality with our Video quality compare tool. The fairly static Ferris wheel scene is rendered fairly well though you can see the effects of the low framerate. When the lights go out, the Xperia neo L has lighting fast reflexes and adjusts quickly to the dark, but a lot of noise appears. The third chard shows that videos are oversharpened too, just like the still photos.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L has quad-band 2G and dual-band 3G. Mobile data speeds are boosted by 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP on hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dedicated app, Media Remote, will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. It has a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Remote app is available for free download at the Play Store so other Android smartphones can use it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neo L also comes with Sony's LiveWare manager, which can be set to launch an app each time you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ICS browser rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the biggest advantages that the Sony Xperia neo L gets from running Android ICS out of the box is the updated web browser. This browser has a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser chrome is quite minimalistic; all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key you get more options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart. For example, when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other trick is Incognito mode - there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available from the Labs settings) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the side. Those really improve the browser experience. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes out a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important features in the web browser is the full Flash 11 support. It did not come pre-installed on our phone, but ran without any problems when we installed in from the Play Store. YouTube videos played smoothly all the way up to 720p (1080p crashed the plugin, not that you'd want to watch 1080p video on this phone). Flash games played trouble free too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L lasts a bit over 4 hours when browsing the web over Wi-Fi. That's about as much as the Xperia neo V did and a bit better than Xperia U.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo L comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). The Pro version (a $15/?13 update) can also edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable and panning is blazing fast. There's built-in file browser and cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and SugarSync).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OfficeSuite is a pretty capable file browser too, but Astro comes preinstalled and has even more functions. Its welcome screen gives you easy access to your photos, music, documents, it lets you back up apps, kill running apps and check which folders are eating up precious storage space on your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap on the Manage my files button and you get into the full-blown file browser. It can do all the basic stuff (new folder, copy, delete, etc.), plus batch operations, search for files and ZIP multiple files and folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries but you can't edit them on the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can expand advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player. There's no world clock, stopwatch or timer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Play Books came preinstalled. The eBook reading app features several preloaded books (Frankenstein, children's stories by Hans Christian Andersen and Pride and Prejudice). The app has an attractive page turn effect and, of course, lets you add new books to your collection from Google's store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also make books available offline (by default they're pulled from the web on demand), change various text display options to make reading more comfortable and enable the Read out loud option, if you feel like a bedtime story.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Offline Google Maps and Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo L comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and some surrounding area before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xperia neo L came with a Wisepilot trial with 30 days' worth of a full navigation license. The app offers info on weather, traffic, speed cameras and alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot uses online maps by default, so you'll need a data connection - but it works even in countries where Google Maps Drive doesn't. You can purchase offline maps if you like - a 2-year license for the whole of Europe is 5 Euro and North America is 5 Dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to go with the online-only version, the Abroad mode makes sense. It will reduce roaming data usage and maps are cached (so, you if you start off at home or your hotel with the phone hooked up to a Wi-Fi network, you'll save even more).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just can't promise you that your Xperia neo L will also come with the same Wisepilot license, it may be a region-specific feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store is all good, but the neo L has limited system storage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L is running ICS, so it has access to the latest apps (like Chrome), but the limited amount of app storage means you'll need to be careful with large apps (again, like Chrome) or move a lot of the apps to the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia neo L is a decent phone (though the build quality fails to impress ) that showed up late to the party. It's clearly an old design from the Sony Ericsson era - and those phones were a bit behind the times to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest weapons that the neo L has in its arsenal are its screen and OS - 4" WVGA and Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich are a pretty good combo, plus there's a decent still camera, good web browsing and expandable memory. So, it's a phone that can do a good job for many.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes plenty of friendly fire though - we only managed to find it at a price (?210) that's higher of the newer, dual-core Sony Xperia U (?205). Be warned though - the U has a smaller screen (3.5"), older OS (Gingerbread, to be updated) and limited, non-expandable storage (4GB user accessible). For a bit more cash (240 euro), you can get a dual-core Sony Xperia sola with a 3.7" screen (with floating touch technology) and a microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Xperia neo V (?190) will give you pretty much the same specs as the neo L (ICS included) with a cherry on top - a microHDMI port and a hardware camera shutter key. Its only downside is the smaller screen (3.7"), though you'll be paying less for it, so it's a reasonable tradeoff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia U ? Sony Xperia sola ? Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 - it offers a dual-core CPU (at 800MHz), a 3.8" WVGA screen and an SD card slot. Just like the Xperia U, however, it's still on Gingerbread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L7 does run ICS and has similar specs to the neo L, though it can't shoot 720p video. The older, Optimus Black can and has a bright display (700 nits), but its ICS future is uncertain. An ICS-running Optimus L5 is cheaper than both, but that HVGA resolution is stretched too thin across the 4" diagonal (we did say the high-res screen is one of the neo L's strong suits).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 I8160 ? LG Optimus L7 P700 ? LG Optimus Black P970 ? LG Optimus L5 E610</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There you have it - in this price range, compromises will have to be made and we're leaning in favor of the dual-cores . The OS can be updated, but the CPU inside the phone is there to stay. Also, there are rumors of an Xperia J, which has almost the exact same specs as the neo L and will make it obsolete when it gets official.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Sony Xperia neo L does have some advantages over the competition, it faces a tough road ahead with its current pricing. Some people will be inclined to make different compromises than us, and they will probably find value in the Neo L over the NXT line or the Xperia sola, but their number is more likely than not to dwindle over the next few months.</paragraph>
