			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 is just like the rest of the premium Lumia smartphones we've seen, but bigger and faster. The advanced imaging and the custom app selection by Nokia will make the difference against Android phablets, with the Snapdragon 800 making sure the Finn won't feel outgunned. Sounds like a promise for the best experience yet on Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few months ago Nokia was in the headlines for what seemed the wrongest of reasons to people who fondly remembered the Finns from their glory days. Voices were rising once again above the lamenting choir, about what might have been had Nokia gone with Android instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, we're well past the what-ifs and should-haves. And no, it's not because Microsoft's check has already been written. Nokia's first phabet has crossed into what was, until now, a strictly Android territory. And not just average droids either, but some of the biggest, meanest species of Android we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 didn't just tip-toe in, looking over its shoulder. Armed with a PureView camera, a 1080p display and a quad-core Snapdragon 800, the Finnish giant entered with a bang!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest GDR3 version of Windows Phone finally has support for quad-core Krait processors and Full HD displays. There's an attempt too, to make better use of the size and resolution by adding an extra column of contents across the interface. It was about time Microsoft brought the platform back in the hardware race and we are delighted to finally meet the first Windows Phone to aim for the pole position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance the Lumia 1520 looks like a magnified Lumia 1020 - it has the same design and build, only without the camera hump. The trademark unibody is the right bit more impressive at that size, while the PureView camera has lost some of its sensor area and half of its pixels, but hopefully kept the amazing image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's Lumia Black update isn't bringing as many new features as Amber, while the GDR3 version mostly makes sure the OS would happily accommodate the new chipset and screen resolution. Users will perhaps have to wait for the 8.1 update for a notification center (hopefully) and a file manager (not too likely) among other things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yup, the Lumia 1520 sounds just like what the doctor ordered for the ailing Nokia cellphone business. It makes us sad that they've decided to scrap any future effort altogether, but that doesn't mean it won't be closing the show with a bang. We may be well into their farewell season, but the finale is not close. It's too early to write Nokia off just yet - what we have ahead seems like the climax of its work. And the hardware inspection of one of their finest specimens is just a click away. So, shall we?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia Lumia 1520<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520's retail package is the standard blue box that has become a signature feature of the Lumia line. Other than that you get the standard set of accessories: a charger with a detachable microUSB cable, a SIM ejector tool, some printed manuals and a single-piece headset of in-ear design.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 is, inevitably, a large slab, the 6" screen alone is huge for a pocketable device. At 162.8 x 85.4 x 8.7mm, it's actually reasonably sized for a phablet. Its weight however is not, the Lumia 1520 weighs good 209g, which is almost the same as the aluminum-clad 5.9-inch HTC One Max (217g), which even has a wider footprint and a thicker profile going against it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia design has been pretty much set in stone but not without some variations. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is actually very similar to the Lumia 925. The difference to the Lumia 1020, for instance, is that the top and bottom edges are rounded rather than flat. Other than that, the rectangular look and beveled sides are an unmistakable trait of the Lumia line since its inception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phablets are pushing the limits of what can be considered pocketable and comfortable for one-handed use. That said, the Lumia 1520 is not the biggest around - as we said, the HTC One Max is a tad taller and heavier, while the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 is tangibly bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those have some software features to help with one-handed use tough, which mostly amount to squishing keyboards (i.e. the on-screen QWERTY and the dialer) in the corner so you can reach buttons with your thumb. Windows Phone lacks such options and the Lumia 1520's large screen will have people permanently constrained to two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet maintains the capacitive Back, Home and Search buttons just like other phablets (One Max, Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Mega 6.3). Above the screen is a 1.2MP/720p front-facing camera along with an array of sensors. The front of the phablet is almost entirely coated with Gorilla Glass 2, which covers the screen, the capacitive keys and front camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic layout of the other hardware controls is unchanged - all the buttons are on the right side, starting with the volume rocker on top, the power key and finally the two stage shutter key. Those keys have been moved down so they are easy to reach with your thumb (though volume up is a bit of a stretch).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Lumia 1520 holds the nanoSIM card compartment and the microSD card slot. Those have to be opened with a dedicated tool, which might be a hindrance if you swap memory cards often. Still, we're always glad to see expandable storage, especially on devices with high resolution screens and high megapixel cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phablet features a regular microUSB 2.0 port, while the 3.5mm audio jack is smack in the middle on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the back of the Nokia Lumia 1520 that's quite interesting. The 20MP PureView camera with ZEISS lens and optical image stabilization protrudes slightly from the back, but less so than the Lumia 1020's camera. Keep in mind that the 1520 is 1.7mm thinner than the 1020 too, using a smaller sensor has really helped Nokia keep that unsightly hump in check.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the sensor size - a smaller 1/2.5" vs. a bigger 1/1.5" - there has been another concession made, there is no xenon flash but a dual-LED light instead. Still, the sensor is relatively big (around 45% bigger than the common 1/3" sensors), which combined with OIS should still make for some great low-light shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 phablet has a whopping four microphones, a pair on the front and another two on the back. At the front, there's one below the screen and one near the earpiece. On the back, there's one above the LED and one inside the loudspeaker grille. The mics in each pair are sufficiently wide apart, so you can expect great stereo sound capture from both the back and the front camera. The mics also include Nokia's proprietary HDR tech and Bass filter option and also allow for noise suppression of ambient noise when for instance, you are recording a person talking in front of the camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery in the Lumia 1520 is sealed, but it has the reasonably big capacity of 3,400mAh. The phablet comes with built-in wireless charging, a feature that was missing in the 1020. To make use of it however, you would have to buy separately a Qi wireless charger - these days those come in many shapes and sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The massive battery, light-weight Windows Phone OS and power-efficient display were made to count in video-playback and web browsing test. They surely helped the Lumia 1520 achieve an amazing score despite the huge estate to light up. Talk time and the overall stand-by endurance are great too thus the 107h top-notch rating is no surprising.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, with an overall rating of 107 hours, the Lumia 1520 is well ahead of the other phablets we've tested so far. What this number means is that the Lumia 1520 should manage four and a half days on a single charge if used for one hour each of calls, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 has a 6" IPS LCD screen of 1080p resolution, the pixel density works out to 367ppi. The LCD incorporates Nokia's ClearBlack tech - a set of polarizing filters, which minimize glare. Plus, Gorilla Glass 2 on top for protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive touch sensor on the display features the supersensitive touch technology that allows it to detect fingers even through winter gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1520 comes with the Lumia Color Profile option in the settings, which gives you two sliders to play with - one for color temperature (which spans the cool, neutral and warm range) and color saturation (natural to vivid).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Glance screen keeps the clock and notification counters visible even after you lock the screen. This could be set to appear only for a little while after you lock the screen, intermittently on and off and always on. There's a separate always on setting for when the device is charging. A Night mode allows you to pick a different color for the Glance screen info - Red, Green or Blue - if the default White setting is too bright for your sleepy eyes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One new option in GDR3 is the screen rotation lock. That's an important feature for a phablet, but unfortunately it's only accessible from the Settings menu, which means you have to leave the app you are using to change it, there are no quickly accessible toggles here (this is a common problem for any settings in Windows Phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the Lumia 1520 screen is tack sharp. Due to its large diagonal, pixel density drops below 400ppi, but 367ppi is still better than what most people's eyes can resolve, especially when you consider you tend to hold a phablet further away from your eyes than a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 1520 display matrix compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are excellently wide with only a minor shift in contrast when going to extremes. Color rendering is good and, as an added bonus, you can tweak the white balance and saturation to your liking. The one weak spot of the display is the black levels, which are not as great as on AMOLED, but the overall contrast is still quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ClearBlack tech does help minimize reflectivity. The relatively low brightness however hurt the outdoor performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: GDR3 + Lumia Black<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 comes with Windows Phone 8 GDR3 (the Lumia Black edition) out of the box. The Microsoft-issued GDR3 reelase and the Nokia-made Black enhancements add a handful of new features, but most importantly bring support for 1080p screens and the Snapdragon 800 chipset, without which the 1520 would've been impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the user interface still feels very familiar if you are coming from another Windows Phone device. Yes, you can fit more Live Tiles per row on the homescreen (6 of the smallest ones, up from 4), but that turned out to be a function of the screen size rather than a Lumia Black specific feature. There are a couple of other changes, we'll get to those in a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button or a double tap on the screen reveals the lockscreen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device or you can just press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone and jump straight into the camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a reasonable level of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to display notifications and images. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps to show a less detailed quick status. There are already apps in the Store that display the battery percentage on the lockscreen via those kind of notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - you can let the music player replace the lockscreen image with the album art of the currently playing track, or let one of the installed apps choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live Tiles, which can be reordered any way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more. Unfortunately, the app launcher is still just an alphabetical list of all apps, no folders, no icon grid. We don't think it works too well on a 6" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 lets you resize the live tiles. Upon a tap and hold, you'll get an extra resize button, next to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking, though not with the level of user control that Android allows. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). If an app needs to run in the background (sat-nav clients, messengers, etc.) it can. Microsoft is expected to bring better multi-tasking with the Windows Phone 8.1 update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new feature in GDR3 is that you can "close" apps by hitting the X button. It's not as comfortable as swiping apps away, but at least now you have control over the recent apps list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes. There's a new Screen rotation lock feature, but it requires you to exit the app, find it in the settings, enable it and then get back to the app. The same goes for all the other settings, it's just too many steps for such a common task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one new setting as part of the GDR3 refresh - screen rotation, where you turn on/off the automatic UI rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live Tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has confirmed working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android, for example, has a widget that shows you a list of emails complete with the subject and a line of the message body. You can scroll through that list and hit a specific message to read it. There are more examples of how widgets are more interactive than Live Tiles and while the difference is relatively minor on the small 4" screen of the Lumia 520, the setup feels limiting on the large, high-res screen of the Lumia 1520. Let's not even mention the split-screen multitasking and mini apps that are popular on 5+ inch devices and are certainly not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1520 comes with the Data Sense app, which shows you the amount of data you've used. Both cellular and Wi-Fi traffic is accounted for. There are different data limit types: one-time, monthly and unlimited. The first two accept custom bandwidth limit values, while the latter is applicable if you have an unlimited data plan, but would still like to track your usage. With GDR3 there's an option to prevent data usage when roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Data Sense can also restrict the background data usage for all apps, provided you're near a preset data limit. This will prevent some apps from functioning properly, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Nokia Lumia 1520 comes with a special feature for kids conveniently dubbed Kid's corner (HTC liked it well enough to put a similar feature on the One series). You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left off the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Driving Mode can be enabled automatically when the phablet connects to a specific Bluetooth device (i.e. your car's stereo). This mode mutes all notifications except calls and texts, but you can mute those too. If you do, you can set an automatic reply text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info relevant to their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a WP8 handset, the Nokia Lumia 1520 also supports voice commands - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Unfortunately, the Windows assistant is still far behind the competition as far as recognition speed and accuracy are concerned. Microsoft is said to be working on a new virtual assistant dubbed Cortana, which should premiere with WP8.1 in US English in early 2014 and before the end of 2014 for the rest of the world (in 44 additional languages).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an Add Contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to build the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" options. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many contacts and too many notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions: "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab has the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc.), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 offered loud and clear in-call sound. Signal reception was problem-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The Phone live tile will show the number of missed calls, as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 1520 scored a Good mark. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around but missed calls shouldn't be a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very capable messenger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (only the whole message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails as read/unread, flag and unflag, etc. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with busy inboxes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text does take some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up with the available actions and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos with SkyDrive integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include Bluetooth file transfer, NFC-enabled tap+send, messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music, Videos, FM radio share one app, Noka Music still on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing its own music service called Mix Radio ahead on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike competing services you can also browse a specific artist and even buy songs to keep if you like. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2013, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several other advantages - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs close to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since the GDR2 update. Now it supports XviD, DivX, MOV and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on board the Lumia 1520, thanks to the Lumia Amber firmware. You can use the loudspeaker for the FM radio, though you still need the headset connected as it doubles as an antenna. To enable the loudspeaker playback, just tap and hold on the station and select the appropriate option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 isn't the cleanest, but it's among the louder phablets out there when it comes to audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first Nokia phablet did very well in the first part of our test, posting excellent scores top to bottom and garnishing them with above average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things aren't quite as spotless when you plug in a pair of headphones - some extra stereo crosstalk sneaks in, the frequency response deteriorates slightly and some distortion appears. The readings are still good, just not the best in class. The volume doesn't drop at all, though, which makes it excellent for this testing scenario.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>20MP PureView camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 has a brand new Nokia PureView camera. It uses a 1/2.5" sensor with 20MP resolution. To put that in context, the sensor has 15% smaller surface area than the 20MP 1/2.3" sensor in the Xperia Z1 and about a third of the size of the Lumia 1020's PureView sensor. On the other hand the Lumia 1520 camera imager is still almost twice the size of most of its competitors, and 30% larger than those who tout "big" 1/3" sensors - like the iPhone 5s and the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 offers ZEISS lens, but it has a relatively narrow f/2.4 aperture (compared to f/2.2 on the 1020). There's no xenon flash either, all of which should affect the low-light performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the good news is that Nokia managed to keep the optical image stabilization and the dual-LED flash is stronger than the common single-LED units, so the Lumia 1520 should still be competitive against other devices in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has created a special app for its flagship Lumias dubbed Nokia Pro Camera. Being one of the phone's key software features, it's there to compliment the PureView camera with a simple user interface that allows users to fine tune the camera settings. It may sound intimidating, but Nokia has done a great job of making the app simple to use for both novices and professionals alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Camera is the successor of Nokia Camera Pro and is the advanced imaging software the Lumia 1520 is meant to be used with. It features transparent box in the top center with six camera settings. From left to right they are flash, white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on each of them opens a ring-based interface on the right side of the screen. You can access all of them simultaneously by sliding the on-screen shutter button to the left. This will stack sliders for all six settings next to one another allowing you to easily fiddle with them all at the same time. The settings you modify are kept at the values you chose, with the others adjusted accordingly by the software. We really like this interface - it's intuitive and powerful at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One major complaint about the Lumia 1020's camera is how slow it is to save photos. We're happy to report the Lumia 1520 camera is a significant improvement in this respect - it's clearly faster (about three times depending on the scenario) and while still not the snappiest around it's certainly not bothering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned earlier, the Camera lens has another cool trick up its sleeve. It snaps two photos at once - one in full resolution (16MP or 19MP depending on the chosen aspect ratio) and another one in 5MP, which benefits from the pixel oversampling technology, while at the same time being far easier to share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get lossless zoom of just under 2x for the 5MP shots. It's not completely lossless as it using it means you will have to do without oversampling, but it's miles ahead of the digital zoom competitors are offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Camera also comes with a brand new option - shooting in RAW. It's DNG - digital negative - format developed by Adobe, which has wide support in photo editing software. While casual consumers are way better off sticking to JPEG, photo enthusiasts can use the RAW files, which contain all the information captured by the sensor, to produce even better results. Without the JPEG compression applied you get more headroom for editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that those DNG files are around 20MB big, while a full-resolution JPEG is around 4MB, the 5MP JPEGs are a mere 1MB. RAW files cannot be viewed by most desktop software either (e.g. web browsers) without processing, which is another thing to keep in mind if you want to share photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of the app also has the Nokia Smart Camera suite, so you don't have to switch from one app to the other to get the cool effects. The Smart camera makes you hold the phone steady for a few seconds for each shot, but then allows you to remove moving objects, change the faces of those in the photo, simply pick the best shot from the bunch of clips it makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Smart Camera shoots a burst of 10 photos at 5MP resolution and allows you to edit those photos later. When editing a Smart Camera photo you choose one of several modes by swiping through their respective cards, each with a helpful label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic feature here is best shot - automatically selecting the best photo out of the 10 (you can manually override the selection). You can also select the best expression for each individual face in the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multiple photos can be used to remove moving objects as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Action shot - a moving object is overlaid on the photo several times to create a sense of motion. You can pick which of the 10 photos are used to create the action shot and the multiple copies can either be opaque or semitransparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other mode that enhances motion is Motion focus - it locks the moving object, but blurs the background around it. Imagine turning the camera to track a fast moving object, that's the effect that Motion focus simulates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has a number of cool camera lenses, which we've covered before and are exclusive to the Lumia line, but the most impressive is the new Refocus lens. It snaps several photos at different focus points and allows you to interactively change the focus of the image after the fact or bring the whole image in focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Best of all, these interactive images are easy to share by email, Facebook and messaging, unlike some other proprietary camera apps that lock you into the maker's ecosystem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a Refocus images in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama lens is self-explanatory - you press the shutter and then align the camera as instructed (the app will put circles you have to aim for). It's good, but you always shoot right to left (can't switch direction), which is a bit annoying. Shooting in portrait orientation is impossible too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph lens creates photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting - a tripod works best. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern. You can get back to the image later and correct it if you didn't get it right the first time around (we did that to reduce camera shake visible in the background).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Camera app isn't limited to shooting still images, it can capture video too, and does quite well. Tapping the video icon at the top gets you to the video part of the app. There you have access to just the relevant settings: flash, white balance and focus. The focus can be set to either manual, auto or infinity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording also makes use of OIS and oversampling. Zoom is enabled even during video capture and it can go up to 3x in 1080p mode and up 4x in 720p mode. The 1080p videos are recorded at 30fps, but you can pick 24fps and 25fps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 has a total of four mics (two at the front, two on the back) with the company's proprietary Rich Audio Recording for distortion-free sound recording in loud environments. These can be used for another intriguing feature as well - it's dubbed Directional stereo. When you enable it, the sound in front of the camera is recorded clearer than the rest, potentially dealing with unwanted noises in your video and enhancing a subject's voice.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People already have really high expectations for any PureView camera, so the first time we heard Nokia is halving the sensor resolution and reducing the size we were a bit worried. Then after we learned the Lumia 1520 will be lacking a xenon flash we started to prepare for a disappointment. Is this really a PureView camera that can live up to its brand? Let's find out!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start off with full resolution 19MP photos first as they are the basis of the 5MP shots. Luckily, the images look really good - the amount of detail and contrast is great and while some of the less-objectionate luminance noise is to be spotted, there's no chroma noise. Just like the previous PureView cameras, with Lumia 1520 full resolutions samples you are able to capture everything, even tiny details that goes well beyond the capabilities of lower-resolution cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia went with color reproduction that is as accurate as possible on the 808 PureView, but then upped the saturation for the Lumia 1020. Having faced lots of negative feedback the Finns decided to revert to their original strategy with the Lumia Black update. And since Lumia 1520 comes with Lumia Black out of the box we were hoping that natural is what we'll get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned the resolved colors are indeed more natural and closer to the 808 PureView phone, although we did get the occasional off white balance. Luckily, with a viewfinder this big, you can easily see when the automatic white balance is failing and intervene via one of the virtual rings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, we were once again impressed by the dynamic range. There's no easy HDR mode (you'll have to use bracketing and combine the images manually) but the Lumia 1520 handles bright highlights and dark shadows in the same shot noticeably better than other smartphone cameras we've tested. Also, check out the macro shot - we couldn't get extremely close to our toy subject (the minimum focus distance is 15cm), but the shallow depth of field is very noticeable and works great to separate the subject from the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's move on to the 5MP shots. These photos are the ones you'll be sharing on Facebook or via email. They are also easily the best 5MP photos we've seen outside of the 808 PureView and the Lumia 1020. The noise is almost non-existent at this point and the per-pixel detail is really great. Unfortunately the lousy white balance remains so you need to be tweaking it manually more frequently than we'd like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the unique features of the Lumia 1520 is the digital lossless zoom, so we tried that too. The samples below show a 5MP image with no zoom, a 5MP image at just under 2x zoom and a full resolution shot. Bottom line is - you can achieve the same result by cropping the full-res image in post processing, but you can opt to save yourself that hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a more clear representation of what a difference 2x zoom makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here is a quick shootout between Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1020 for you to compare. The larger, higher-resolution sensor of the Lumia 1020 helps it resolve more detail and produce images with superior dynamic range, although the difference isn't quite as huge as the sheer numbers suggests. Overall, the Lumia 1520 won't be causing its Lumia 1020 more compact sibling much trouble in the run for the best smartphone, but it certainly is the best-shooting phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the 5MP samples from both Lumia 1520 and 1020, which mostly paint a similar picture. The differences are further diminished with downsizing, but the Lumia 1520 is the clearly superior of the two great cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time to see how well the new Lumia 1520 can do in low-light without a xenon flash. We used a low-light room in our office and tested both Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1020's low-light performances. First, we tried with the flash off, we just kept the AF assist light on to make sure the phones get the right focus. The noise levels on both Lumia phones are high but it's just luminance noise and there's a good deal of fine detail that would be lost on other cameras. The 5MP image reduces the noise and is actually very usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we made the room pitch dark, turned on the flash and snapped some more photos. The xenon flash is more powerful than dual-LED flash on Lumia 1520 and it lit the scene quite evenly, but the end result, white balance aside, is way closer than we expected. The resolved detail in the center of the frame is almost identical and while we'd still take the xenon flash, we have to credit the dual-LED setup of the Lumia 1520 with a very decent performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's good to see Nokia worked its magic and managed to replace a xenon flash with a dual-LED one without compromising the image quality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 shoots 19MP stills and there's only one phone in our database that comes close at that, the Sony Xperia Z1 at 20.7MP. You might want to use the tool's downscaling feature to compare the 1520 against other phones more easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately you can clearly see the white balance is way off on all three shots and even though the resolved detail is great, the bitter taste remains.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Lumia 1520 in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1520 saves both a full resolution image and a supersampled one at 5MP. Here's how that looks compared to Lumia 1020's supersampled images and Xperia Z1's Superior Auto mode (which produces 8MP shots).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Lumia 1520 super sampled shots</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording also greatly benefits from the OIS and oversampling. Zoom is enabled even during video capture and it can go up to 3x in 1080p mode. The 1080p videos are recorded at 30fps by default, but you can also get a more cinematic feel with the 24fps and 25fps options. These are available for 720p resolution (but there's no 60fps mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 also has four mics with the company's proprietary Rich Audio Recording for distortion-free sound recording in loud environments and Directional stereo when needed. The Lumia 1520 records video files with stereo audio at a high 256Kbps bitrate and standard 48kHz sampling rate. There's also Audio Bass Filter, which filters out low-frequency noise. It can be set to 100Hz (the default), 200Hz (strong) and Off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1520 features Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which highly improves the look of a video - it dampens hand shake and makes camera movement look smooth and professional (as opposed to shaky home footage). We recorded a short sample to show how the 1520 handles walking and panning. You can "see" footsteps in the video but the shaking from them is mostly not annoying. The slow pan looks almost Hollywood like, while the faster pan is jerkier. We did the test side by side with the Lumia 1020 for easy comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>OIS has become available on some Android phones too, but most of them can't do this - 3x lossless zoom. It's controlled with a pinch gesture or the one-finger Slide Zoom that was introduced on the Nokia 808 PureView (unfortunately, the volume rocker doesn't work). You can do it during video recording. With no supersampling, the image quality drops a bit, but it's still a top notch video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, unlike the still camera performance, where the Lumia 1520 was a cut above its phablet competitors, its video recording capabilities are average at best. The sound recording is impressive, but the actual footage is way behind the Galaxy Note 3 and its 4K videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 30s 1080p sample we've uploaded on YouTube for you to enjoy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, quad-band 3G with HSPA and penta-band 4G LTE connectivity (there are three versions of the phone with a different set of 3G and LTE bands).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in range of an LTE network, the 1520 will do up to 150Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If not, HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA and Wi-Fi Hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wallet app also uses NFC connectivity. Unfortunately, we won't know whether that has any potential to expand beyond its out-of-the-box functionality for at least a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is still useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC comes into play with some accessories too - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you put the Lumia 1520 on top of it and will charge it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager (although a third party app is now in its beta testing stages) and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone and your microSD storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast Internet Explorer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on the Lumia 1520 is the classic Windows Phone 8 deal, which has hardly changed with the minor update of the OS. The Lumia 1520 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing and the 367ppi pixel density keeps text sharp even at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer browser on the Nokia Lumia 1520 had the same great SunSpider and BrowserMark performance as its Lumia 1020 predecessor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 1520 brings you to the new Bing search app. At first glance, it's the same app overall - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Local Scout now integrated into the places section of Nokia Maps, there are now two search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is the camera scanner, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The second is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone Store reaches 200k apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of available apps has recently passed the 200,000 milestone and while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that 46 out of the top 50 apps on the other platforms are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 don't work on the older versions but all of the older apps are compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop till you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have an Xbox Music pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected, limited 10 downloads per month). The service costs $10 / ?8.99 a month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, or the windowsphone.com website, from where you can push apps to your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Games tile, previously known as Xbox Live, is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HERE Maps and Drive+ get a makeover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a high-end Lumia smartphone, the 1520 gets the Drive+ navigation suite for free out of box. Unlike Drive available on lower-end Lumias, Drive+ has global coverage, meaning it can easily be used abroad. And since it's available offline you don't have to worry about roaming data charges, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Drive+ offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive+ you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive+ uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers an even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most recent update to the HERE suite adds an overview of traffic conditions in your area, including your drive to and from work with the My Commute app. My Commute shows you an at-a-glance look at your specified commute with a special Live Tile on your homescreen. You can setup up multiple commutes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest release, the former Local Scout and City Lens features have been integrated into the Places section of HERE Maps, and gives you a quick view of restaurants, shops, galleries and other POIs around you, including an augmented reality view via the camera called LiveSight. Tapping the virtual signs in the camera interface pops up more info about the place, as well as directions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent Office skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Lumia exclusive apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's Zinio, which isn't made by Nokia but is exclusive to Lumia devices on Windows Phone. Zinio creates a reading list based on your interests and you can set it to download them for offline reading (only over Wi-Fi). Zinio is also a shop for digital magazines - you can buy single issues or subscribe for 12 issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has pre-installed its cool Creative Studio that is really powerful and offers some awesome features. After you choose a photo you must select an effect you want to apply (it's optional, of course). Then you can use focus+blur mode to focus on an object and blur the rest of the picture. You can also pop up a color and make the rest of the image black and white. Collage maker is also included. Naturally various image editing options such as color balance, brightness, crop, rotation, auto fix, radial+tilt shift, etc. are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is this new app called Nokia Storyteller. It's quite similar to Samsung's Story Album. After a shooting session you are able to group all the new photos into an album. Albums can be created based on location, the people in the photo and when the shot was taken. Storyteller is much better looking than Samsung's Story Album, more intuitive and easy to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 is the company's first phablet but we're not saying that to set the scene for a softer verdict. On the contrary, an evolutionary leap for Windows Phone in terms of both hardware and software, the Lumia 1520 is a phablet worth having. No need to heap praise when it's as simple as that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, one can say the same for at least a couple of Microsoft-powered smartphones (mostly Finnish-made in honesty). No, Windows Phone isn't the most popular mobile OS and not as rich as the competition in apps and games, but it has value-adding features that are either unique or which require extra purchases over at the competition's camp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It almost looks like Nokia and Microsoft were trying to impress each other at who can heap more goodies on the Lumia 1520. The global life-time voice-guided navigation license, the amazing imaging skills and Nokia Music against Microsoft Office, SkyDrive integration and Xbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make it even better, this friendly competition was taken to the next level with Microsoft finally enabling support for high-res screens and the latest-generation of chipsets. As a result, the Lumia 1520 isn't all PureView camera but can flex its computing muscle right in the face of a bunch of incredulous droids. And what a bunch that is!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung's Galaxy Note 3, the last descendant of the product family that started it all, is deservedly at the top of the list. It's powered by the same Snapdragon 800 chipset and flaunts a 5.7" Super AMOLED screen and a solid 13MP cam. What certainly sets the Note 3 apart is the S-Pen pressure-sensitive stylus support, on top of an already feature-rich TouchWiz. At almost &#x20ac;200 cheaper than the Nokia phablet, the Galaxy Note 3 is probably the device the Lumia 1520 should be worried about the most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max is the obvious match for size, though with a tad smaller 5.9" display and powered by the previous generation Snapdragon 600. It is made entirely of metal, comes with massive front stereo speakers and offers buttery-smooth Android experience. HTC One Max's camera is clearly inferior to the Lumia 1520's, so if you are after top notch imaging, with the One Max you would be looking in the wrong place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One Max</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently released Oppo N1 is a more likely competitor in cameraphone terms, and one that costs considerably less. Just like the HTC One Max, the Oppo N1 has a 5.9" 1080p display and is powered by the Snapdragon 600 chipset, but comes with a few unique features: a swivel 13MP camera, a rear touchpad and the O-Click remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo N1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z Ultra has the high-end Snapdragon 800 ticking inside and isn't afraid to push phablet boundaries with its 6.44" display. The Xperia Z Ultra is IP58-certified for water and dust resistance, something no other phablet can match. Unfortunately, the ample bezels around the screen make the Sony phablet particularly hard to carry around despite its marvelously slim waistline. The camera is rather disastrous too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z Ultra</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This isn't about whether or not the Nokia Lumia 1520 is the best phablet on the market. Rome wasn't built in a day and it will certainly take more than one attempt to knock the Galaxy Note 3 off its perch. But Nokia has surely done well - the Lumia 1520 a device that can potentially interest more people than most phablets usually would.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia may be heading for the exit but the legacy of achievement left behind wouldn't have been as great without the Lumia 1520. Yet, the 1520 will go down in history as the one that challenged the droids in a way no one thought possible. A way that makes you cringe at the thought that there might never be another phablet carrying that brand.</paragraph>
