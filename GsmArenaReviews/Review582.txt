			<paragraph>Sophisticated looks and exclusive bodywork have unfailingly implied a no-thrills performance. Now, that may as well be the Secret about LG KF750. What we have here is an exquisitely crafted premium handset with a feature pack worthy of its looks. The LG KF750 Secret is the third slimmest handset to feature a 5 megapixel camera and that's just the icing of the cake. Touch screen and exotic Neon Touch navigation, some amazing video recording capabilities and auto-rotation get delivered in a carbon fiber and tempered glass package. Never has Black Label promised this much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An out-and-out review of the tempting LG KF750 Secret is under way but we feel a first look is quite worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG secret joins the company's Black Label series, topping the Chocolate and Shine appeal with some muscle borrowed from the Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are still to see if the Secret's performance is on par with looks and how the more-than-impressive feature-pack translates to real use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hit the jump for more Secrets revealed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KF750 Secret 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Measuring 102.8 x 50.8 x 11.8 mm LG KF750 Secret is a truly compact slider. The most impressive is of course the less than twelve millimeter thickness. That makes the LG KF750 Secret one of the most pocket-friendly devices out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 116 grams is more of a compliment considering the high-quality materials used. In fact, the weight does benefit the handling of the LG Secret.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Black Label series LG Secret is dressed to kill. As far as we are concerned, it has no problem matching those high expectations. The tempered glass on the display is awesome and so is the carbon fiber / leather-like combo at the back. The metal frame around the front panel is another sleek ornament.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, the finish might not appeal to just everybody and we find that understandable. Some of the members of our team were not too fond of the way the carbon-fiber looks blend with the rest of the surface, while others thought the leather-like back is just too much. But hey, everyone is entitled to their own preferences, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's get back back to today's Top Secret show. The earpiece of LG KF750 Secret is centrally placed near the upper edge of the front. Next to it are the video-call camera and the ambient light sensor. The latter allows the device to automatically adjust display brightness to its current environment. It can also be disabled, should the LG Secret user find it necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the earpiece is the 262K-color display of QVGA resolution. The LG Secret screen measures 2.4 inches in diagonal. Picture quality is excellent but the glossy surface seriously harms sunlight legibility. Other than that, brightness and contrast levels are commendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting detail about the display is that it's actually touch-enabled but the touchscreen functionality is limited to the multimedia menu only. We will come back to that a little later in this preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the rather exotic navigation solution of LG KF750 Secret - the Neon Touch navigation pad. It basically is a touch-sensitive pad with only the confirmation center a regular knob. Some nice illumination effects enhance the navigation experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should warn you that we had a bit of trouble getting used to the touchpad - the reason for that is there are two context keys on the pad besides the four directional ones, which are not marked in any way, so finding them is at times a trial-and-error process. Furthermore, the combination of hardware and touch sensitive keys can be really confusing to some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, once we got the hang of it, we found it a very smooth and fun way to control the phone. LG are worth commending for the fun-and-friendly navigation implemented in their recent releases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding LG KF750 Secret open reveals the alphanumeric keypad, which scores a point too. The keys are large enough and well defined, to offer good touch orientation and press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece on LG Secret is at the bottom, while the USB slot and the lanyard eyelet are on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four keys on the right side of the handset. They include a volume rocker, the touch media key, the shortcut menu key and the camera button. All of those are comfortable enough to use. The touch media key deserves more attention since it's used to turn the touch sensitivity of the display on and off. The top part is quite bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of LG KF750 Secret features the 5 megapixel camera, the LED flash and the AF assist light. The AF assist light is really of help when shooting in dark environments. The LED flash however isn't powerful enough so, unless you're taking a photo of a close object or shooting video, it won't be of much value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is made of carbon fiber and it looks really nice (at least to some of us, that is). We did expect it to have some sort of rough surface, but actually it feels like glass when you touch it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening mechanism is also very smartly designed. You only need to press the key below the battery cover and it pops up. When you fit it back on, a click indicates that the piece has locked in its proper position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the carbon fibre back cover of LG KF750 Secret lies the 800 mAh Li-ion battery quoted at 260 hours of stand-by time and 4 hours of talk-time. Having spent so little time with the LG Secret, we are still unable to elaborate on those numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot is also under the battery cover. Not the most comfortable solution, but with the smart opening mechanism we just described, it might not be such a big issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are delighted with the build quality and handling of LG Secret. The high-quality casing is a true showoff.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Flash user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the latest LG handsets we have reviewed - KF600 and KF510 - the LG Secret features a flash user interface. It is visually appealing and quite user-friendly. The fast and responsive device is a pleasure to use. In addition, the whole menu structure is very straightforward and new users will quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The really cool secret feature of the LG Secret user interface (pun intended) is the Touch media menu. It is enabled by pressing the corresponding key at the right side of the handset. It is the only menu where you actually get to use the touchscreen capabilities of the KF750 (yes, it gets us wondering why LG limited its functionality this way!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch media grants you quick access to the music player, picture gallery, document viewer, FM radio and the M-toy application. That last one is a game, or more a set of 6 mini-games, which put the built-in accelerometer to use. We found them entertaining enough and the accelerometer response really precise. It gives a real nice, almost physical feel when used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the built-in accelerometer, it's also used for automatic screen rotation when watching a video or when browsing images in the Touch media gallery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel camera sounds great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Secret flaunts a 5 megapixel camera with auto focus. It also sports face detection, AF assist light and LED flash. The best thing about it however is the video recording capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the LG KU990 Viewty, the Secret can manage VGA videos at 30 fps and slow-motion QVGA at the sweet 120 fps. And all the video files are encoded as DivX AVI files. Now isn't that cool!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to capture a few quick videos to see what this fella is capable of. Was that your camcorder shaking with fear?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let us tell you what's even cooler. The new video recording mode called Fast video. It's actually what's called time-lapse video - we really enjoyed using it. The time-lapse feature is found in many digicams, but there's not a single GSM handset to offer it. It's strange when you think of it, since it doesn't require any powerful hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expect the Fast video to turn much more popular than the 120fps video mode that's well-known from the LG Viewty. Check out the sweet samples that we've captured for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface is similar in terms of features to the one found on the LG KU990 Viewty. Since touchscreen is not enabled for the camera interface, you can only rely on the touch pad for getting around. All in all, the interface is decent, even with a few minor flaws here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a bunch of sample photos taken with the camera of LG KF750 Secret. It produces very good results with much detail, relatively precise colors and acceptable noise levels. At this stage, we are not really sure how exactly it stacks against the best 5 megapixel cameraphones on the market but we will see about that in the review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have only spent a short time with the LG Secret and rushing to conclusions isn't our game. We have to admit however that the handset holds a lot of promise. It has captivating looks and the features to keep you interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have had some issues with the past editions of the flash user interface and we are yet to see if they hold with the Secret. Still from what we see, the Touch media is a really nice add-on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far we are more than pleased with the LG KF750 Secret. We all now have the full review to wait for and see how long the nice first impression will last. Stay tuned in the coming weeks to check if the Secret can jump the high bar it has just set for itself.</paragraph>
