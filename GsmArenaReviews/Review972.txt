			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In their third generation, the Galaxy Tab series by Samsung are finally coming to terms with playing second fiddle to the Notes. The S-Pen and the processing power are, at this point, the main dividing line between mainstream and premium, but the gap will probably widen. If you're after latest-generation chipsets and full-HD screens, the Note line of tablets is by far the safer bet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tabs on the other hand are shaping up as the sensible, value choice. And by the way, having two distinct product lines covering the midrange and the premium segment, is perhaps helping Samsung maintain a relatively strong position despite the fact that the Koreans are clearly not doing as well in the tablet space as in the smartphone realm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not the race to the top the Galaxy Tab 3 tablets are interested in but it isn't the race to the bottom either. Those three seem to make sense in the middle - and no other than the middle sibling stands out from the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 lineup comes in three screen sizes - 7.0, 8.0 and 10.1 inch. It was exactly the eight-inch version that was missing in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 series. The first generation didn't have one either, there was a 7.7" AMOLED sporting slate there instead and an 8.9" LTE-enabled version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 conveniently uses the momentum of the eight-inch Note and, just as conveniently, is giving Samsung the chance to double-mark the iPad mini. Let's start with the rundown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is a cheaper, lighter and thinner version of the Galaxy Note 8.0 that has given up two processor cores and the S-Pen functionality. Still even with a dual-core Exynos chipset the Tab 3 8.0 has a decent amount of power so the cost cutting might not cost too much in terms of user experience. The slate runs the latest Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean skinned with Samsung's TouchWiz, too, so you will be getting plenty of exclusive software goodies to make up for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is probably hoping that its eight-inch tablet will stand out among the seven-inchers, which makers, big and small, have been bringing to the market in droves. The good thing is the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 makes a very positive visual impression - the slim bezels and the great screen to surface ratio are a nice advantage over the 8" Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, it may be a modestly equipped tablet but one that takes portability to heart - the quality build and genuinely compact size are a great place for the new Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 to start. The tablet comes in three versions, suited to every connectivity taste. The one we're about to review is the Wi-Fi-only variant, but 3G and LTE models are be offered too, with full voice and data support at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there'll be little on the outside (other than a side-mounted SIM slot) to set the different versions apart. Follow us on the next page, where we have a close look at the design and build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 stands at 209.8 x 123.8 x 7.4 mm and weighs 314 grams. It is almost as tall as a Galaxy Note 8.0 and a hair slimmer. The width has been reduced significantly though- the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has unbelievably slim screen bezel - slimmer than that of the seven-inch Galaxy Tab 3. It almost looks unnatural - the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is more like a super-sized phone than a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the new generation of Tabs, much like the rest of the Samsung lineup, takes closely after the Samsung Galaxy S4 styling. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 joins quite a clone army of differently-sized Hyperglaze-finished devices, including the Galaxy Mega couple, the Galaxy S4 mini, the other two third-gen Galaxy Tab 3's and even the Note 8.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have all of these laid down on a table you may have a hard time telling which is which - it's pretty much the same situation which saw Apple on the receiving end of jokes about old and new iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is a standard tablet affair - which, in Samsung terms, includes the usual trio of navigation controls below the display. Above the screen are the 1.3MP front-facing camera and an ambient-light sensor. The latter is the same RGB sensor as in the Note II and Note 8.0, the one that's capable of detecting the full spectrum of the ambient light, rather than just its green channel. This results in improved performance under some types of artificial lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As in other recent devices, Samsung has a way of controlling brightness without disabling automatic mode. You define an offset, so your Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 screen will always be slightly brighter or dimmer than the automatically selected level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the classic arrangement of physical hardware Home key flanked by the capacitive Menu and Back keys. A tap and hold on the Back key brings up the Multi-Window taskbar, a tap and hold on the Menu key starts Google Now, while a tap and hold on the Home opens the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 features the microSD card slot (and the microSIM compartment in the 3G/LTE-enabled versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key, volume rocker, and IR-port are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 has the 3.5mm audio jack only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We find the stereo speakers at the bottom of the slate, in portrait mode, on either side of the microUSB port. The connectivity port handles charging and data connections to a computer. It is also MHL-enabled, so you can output HD video via an HDMI adapter or enable USB Host via another adapter (mice, keyboards and flash drives are supported).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has the 5MP camera lens in the top left corner, slightly protruding so the slate rests on it when placed on a level surface, but its hardened glass is not too easy to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is best operated with two hands, whatever the orientation. The super slim side bezels don't provide a comfortable resting position for your thumbs but the flat solid sides allow a comfortable grip of the tablet with one hand across the back in portrait. The ample space below and above the display makes two-hand operation quite comfortable in landscape. The auto-rotating homescreen and lockscreen are welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the good grip, you should be careful handling the Tab 3 8.0 - the hyperglaze case tends to get quite slippery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 feels rock-solid thanks to its compact size and lack of detachable elements on the chassis. The tablet is entirely made of plastic, but the Tab 3 8.0 doesn't feel cheap or flimsy at all. It is quite lightweight though and no problem to carry around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has the same screen as the Note 8.0 - an 8" WXGA (1280 x 800 pixels) unit with 189ppi density and an aspect ratio of 16:10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the image quality is understandably far from what you'd get on a 1080p flagship smartphone, the screen of the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is fairly crisp to the naked eye, and sharper than other Samsung tablets, such as the Tab 2 7.0. It also beats out Apple's iPad mini in terms of ppi. Here's a closer look at the display matrices of each device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are excellent, contrast is really good too and colors are nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 screen up close</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is often the case with tablets, though, sunlight legibility could've been better- the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 screen is clearly no match for some of the high-end smartphones we've tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is powered by a 4450 mAh battery, which should give it enough juice for a few days on non-heavy usage. Since we have the Wi-Fi version of the slate, we can't do our traditional battery routine that includes talk time and give you a score. We performed our browser and video tests anyway to give you an overview of the Tab 3 8.0 battery performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Latest Android 4.2.2 ticks inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 runs TouchWiz-skinned Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. The TouchWiz launcher is very similar to the Galaxy S4 one, but it's been optimized for tablet usage. Unfortunately, the advanced gesture support of the flagship is gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see our usual user interface video here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that because we are reviewing the WiFi-only version, options and settings related to calling will understandably be absent. Still, if you opt for the 3G or LTE-enabled Tab 3 8.0 versions, you'll also get the Phone app and you will be able to make calls and use cellular data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen features the new widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message overlaid on beautiful photos pulled from TripAdvisor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect but you can switch back to the old one, or disable it altogether. If you like the ripple effect though, it's available in the Lockscreen settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News, Smart Remote and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets. There are no pages to the right from the default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The greeting on the lockscreen can be changed - you can type something else, set a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are alternative unlock routines as well - Face unlock, Face and voice unlock, Pattern or Password. There are voice-based wakeup commands that can just start S Voice or launch a preselected app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the notification area there are six (nine in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the new button that reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 14 in total for the Wi-Fi version. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles. Another nice trick is to long press on a toggle to go to the related settings (e.g. Wi-Fi settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider, complete with an Auto toggle. You can disable this slider to have more room for notifications. As in other recent devices, Samsung has a way of controlling brightness without disabling automatic mode. You define an offset, so your Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 screen will always be slightly brighter or dimmer than the automatically selected level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's the so called wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 homescreen auto-rotates, enabling landscape use of the entire interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - any of the available homescreen panes can be set as default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen, giving you an overview of all panes as thumbnails. There's, by the way, a dedicated pane, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can check how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with Multi-window, which lets you run two apps side by side on the screen. You can adjust the dividing line giving one app more space. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the taskbar with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole thing to the other side of the screen. That improves ergonomics a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung tweaked the Settings screen to use a tabbed interface. There's four of them - Connection, My device, Accounts and More. You can find the relevant features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. The company has put together an impressive list of features and options, but that's not a bad thing - the default setup is good enough for regular users, while power users get to have it their way without the need for third party apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and Google's own Voice Actions - it can be used to initiate or answer a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set or snooze an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, take a photo, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem is S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, has the weather forecast for your location and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is powered by a Samsung-made Exynos 4212 dual-core chipset with two Cortex-A9 cores clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and a Mali-400 GPU. We've put it head to head with some of the latest phablets and slates around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the single-threaded Benchmark Pi (it test just a single CPU core) the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 scores about the same as the Galaxy Note II and Note 8.0, but is largely bested by most of the recently announced flagships out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu, Geekbench 2 and Quadrant test the whole chipset and the dual-core chipset Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 shows its age.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark 2.x puts the graphics processor to the test, and the device rates towards the bottom half when offscreen fps are measured. Quite expectedly the Tab 3 8.0 scores the same as the Note II and Galaxy S III - they all feature the same GPU.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 posted an average score in the first overall browsing performance benchmark - Vellamo benchmark, but fared surprisingly well at BrowserMark 2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is not quite the benchmark champion, but you can't expect anything else from a chipset that's two and a half years old now. What's really important though is that we put it through some real torture and it handled it great - even the heaviest of the games ran decently, all apps delivered excellent performance and the Android OS runs without any hiccups.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Efficient phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook in the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is fairly straightforward. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this and you can also let the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 sync your social network contacts if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field in the top left corner, as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or deleting the selected one at the opposite side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options: edit contact, import/export, join contacts, send or print namecards, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is done in a popup window (if you are in landscape mode), where the available fields are displayed, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a field that hasn't existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom field names aren't available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email - new Gmail and Hangouts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender on a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a synch schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts, the ex-GTalk client, handles the Instant Messaging department. The new app is a massive update over the old GTalk and offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, history sync across multiple devices, and completely new UI design. It's available on iOS as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with several text input options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big screen makes for comfortable portrait typing, and we appreciate the extra row just for the numbers. Two finger typing is comfortable on the Tab 3 8.0 in portrait mode, but becomes a pain in landscape. Samsung was thoughtful enough to include a nifty split keyboard which made typing in these situations easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right on the keyboard to position the cursor. The keyboard can also be made into a type of floating widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handwriting recognition is also available, but it's quite slow since there is no S-Pen support. The available keyboards are much better options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and since the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is running Android Jelly Bean, this will work even if the tablet is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. Just like in the phonebook, you can choose what kind of content should be displayed - photos and videos from the phone, Dropbox, Facebook or Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that album's stack of photos but a swipe to the right will list all albums. In this mode you can browse images in a dual-screen mode and easily select files from multiple folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on a picture, the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is great for viewing photos - the screen is as big as most photo frames and the lower resolution doesn't really show. The great viewing angles do, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contextual tags display labels with the location, as well as id the people in the photo and show the date (if there's a GPS tag and you've taught the Tab 3 8.0 about what your friends look like). Then there's the print option, so you can print out photos without going through a computer first (but you'll need a Samsung printer).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player goes after Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 uses an updated version of the TouchWiz music player. Equalizer presets (including a custom one) are available along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapt Sound is available too - an audio calibration tool that tries to combine the most comfortable highs and lows for the best audio in calls and music. This way the phone can map the capacity of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted into various categories (Albums, Songs, Playlists, Artists, Genres, Folders, Composers, Years, Music Square, Nearby devices), but the most interesting one is called Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection - and therefore your mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to move between songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is well known with its great video players and the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is no exception. The video players offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as the visible video thumbnails (all eight of them) are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's still an awesome preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. Dolby Mobile is available in the video player to enhance your audio experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature is the chapter preview - it detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn't a problem either - the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 played FullHD files. Large files worked seamlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 also made a good impression when it offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file. It can also play embedded subtitles within MKV files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Tab 3 8.0 supports Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 earned a Good mark in our loudspeaker test, which means that you should have no problem hearing your notification in noisier environments.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 matches the audio output of the Note 8.0 more premium sibling, delivering excellent scores all over the field when connected to an active external amplifier. Unfortunately it also fails to address the average volume levels issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the output is still impressively clean. The stereo crosstalk does go up, but the rest of the readings are barely affected, adding up to a very solid overall performance. Sadly, volume levels remain about the same.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Tab 3 8.0's main camera can capture stills of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels and 720p videos, while the one on the front takes 1.3MP pictures and VGA video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface features a virtual shutter key and a capture video button that are always available, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 5MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mode button brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops the descriptions but is faster. Unfortunately, unlike the smartphones, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 slates offers only six modes - Auto, Beauty Face, Sound and Shot, Panorama, Sports and Night. There is even no HDR option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more settings in the top left corner, but they won't be used very often. Still, there're a number of interesting options here like the setting for the volume rocker to act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize the shortcuts available here, but most people will probably stick to the Mode selector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are relatively few manual settings, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 just gives you an ISO setting, white balance and exposure compensation. You can also use color effects too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual image quality is pretty good for a 5 megapixel camera. There's lots of fine detail and the noise levels are kept under control. Colors are accurate and the all kind of fringing is almost non-existent. That being said the Tab 3 8.0 is by far not the most comfortable device to take out and about and shoot a lot of photos with, but it still does an excellent job when you need to take pictures.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mediocre 720p videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 stores the 720p videos in MP4 files with a bitrate of 12Mbps. Stereo audio is recorded at 120Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz. You can't take picture while you are shooting a video, but you can pause and resume capturing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus during recording is available though there is no way you can return to autofocus mode once you use the touch focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are nothing impressive in this day and age and the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 samples aren't all that impressive either. Clips lacks detail and the colors look bland even in well-lit environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this 720p video sample we shot with the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched video sample - 720p@30fps (10s, 13.3MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has the basic connectivity features. Since we have the WiFi-only version, there's no GSM/3G/LTE connectivity to speak of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility and Wi-Fi Direct. The tablet also has Bluetooth 4.0 support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare DLNA functionality, which used to be a standalone application, is now more tightly integrated into the respective Samsung applications. To share or access content on nearby DLNA-enabled devices, you do this directly from the My Video app and the Music Player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group Play allows you to share various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 and use multiple Samsung devices (with Group Play app) as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone/slate (e.g. left channel, right, etc.) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music on one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Tab 3 8.0 becomes a hotspot that others connect to) .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for personal use. You can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One advantage the Tab 3 8.0 has over most of the competition is its infrared port. The port is used via the Peel Smart Remote app, which allows the Tab 3 8.0 to act as a controller for television sets of numerous brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. Sadly, there isn't one included in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two other models of the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 available - GSM and 3G capable SM-T310 model and GSM, 3G and LTE enabled SM-T315 version. All of them feature a microSIM slot and are capable of making phone calls, send SMS/MMS messages and use mobile data for internet connectivity. You can check the supported network bands for those models at our dedicated specs page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new Android version always comes with an improved web browser and the Jelly Bean browser running on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is no exception. It looks much like Google Chrome and has pretty much about the same functionality sans the cross-platform sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is the same as most of the desktop browsers - a top row with all the opened tabs, and a second row with the back and forward buttons, the URL bar with a refresh button, the tab switching key and the bookmarks key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as find on page, save for offline viewing, request desktop site and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Samsung feature in the browser is the Print option, which lets you print out web pages straight from your phone. Unfortunately, this only works only with Samsung printers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer you can also use the preloaded Chrome which offers excellent cross-platform sync capabilities. It's quite similar in terms of interface, features (sans the Quick Controls), and behavior. Sometimes it's even faster.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with a good selection of preinstalled apps. A lot of them are centered on the S Pen, but there are some other nice additions as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First comes the Polaris Office 4.0 document viewer and editor. It lets you open word files, pdf's, spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, as well as connect to various cloud services such as Box, Dropbox, and Google Docs. Creating and editing documents, sheets and presentations is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner is really powerful calendar app part of the TouchWiz UI. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, month, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating event is very easy and you can add reminders, location, people, images, repeat intervals. All events automatically sync with your Google account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner can sync with multiple calendar and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled their new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0. It can sync contacts, calendar and notes and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Cloud can also hook up to Dropbox. If you do this, photos and videos from your Dropbox account will be synced with the tablet's gallery. You can have the Tab 3 8.0 sync those photos and videos only over Wi-Fi to save on data usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarm lets you create alarms which can be set to go off not only at various times, but during certain days of the week as well. The World Clock pops up the various cities on a globe, letting you select them for a quick overview the local time zone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, the text size is adjustable and if you flip the Tab 3 8.0 horizontally, you get some advanced math functions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Notes app is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app has an interface similar to that of the gallery, though that one is available only in landscape mode. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Paper Artist imports a photo and runs a filter over it (there are plenty to choose from).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages with either typed text or speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Story Album can be really helpful in organizing your photos. After a shooting session it will prompt you to group all the new photos into an album. Albums can be created based on location, the people in the photo and when the shot was taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes preloaded with a special "Samsung edition" of the TripAdvisor app. Besides the ability to have rotating lockscreen images, the Samsung-specific version of the app allows you to login with your Samsung account, use the S Travel widget for a quick peek at certain popular travel destinations, as well as automatically add relevant travel information to your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the app lets you find interesting things to do if you're in a new city, as well as hotels, restaurants and even flight information. Most locations have reviews posted by other TripAdvisor users, so you can quickly see if a place is worth it or not.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about two minutes to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year's update of the Galaxy Tab series makes room for an 8" tablet and it looks like a logical decision by Samsung to build on the momentum of the Note 8.0. You lose the S-pen and two CPU cores but you get slimmer bezels and lighter weight - some might find that to be a decent trade by itself. But worry not Galaxy Note 8.0, as the Galaxy Tab 8.0 is clearly after different users and markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Samsung dead set on leaving no blank spots in its Android portfolio in terms of screen size, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is a midrange device that fills in yet another slot. It's a peculiar mix of a routine upgrade (software version and industrial design) of a predecessor and a slight downgrade of a premium product, the Galaxy Note 8.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most recent Android version, the latest TouchWiz with exclusive features, the solid build and genuinely portable compact size are the high points on the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0's resume. The package is decently powered too, providing relatively smooth sailing around the UI and good performance with most apps. It's thinner, lighter and looks up-to-date. Not least, the 8" diagonal will help it stand a head above the crowd of Android seven-inchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, some of the 7" tablets shouldn't be written off the list of potential competitors. The Google Nexus 7 in particular comes across as a very serious rival - not to mention its successor that's expected any time now. The Huawei MediaPad and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD are very much in the running as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the most logical alternative comes from Samsung's very own lineup. The Galaxy Note 8.0 will gladly add an extra two processor cores and S-Pen support, and will do so for as little as an extra ?50.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 N5110</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another potential competitor is the Acer Iconia Tab A1. It's a 7.9-inch slate with IPS LED-backlit 1024x768px display and powered by a quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 processor. The Iconia Tab A1 is thicker and heavier, has less RAM and there is no 3G option. It runs a near stock Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and costs about ?200, which makes it a must-see if you are on a tight budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Iconia Tab A1-810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But speaking of eight-inchers the Apple iPad mini is, of course, always at or near the top of the list. The mini costs about ?30 more than the Tab 3 8.0, and has the premium build to show for it, as well as a superior selection of tablet-optimized apps. The iPad mini has a lower-res screen than the Tab 3 8.0 and no version with voice call support, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi &#x2022; Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is a good-looking tablet, compact and lightweight, running the latest Android version available and offering some exclusive value-adding apps and features. It's capable of delivering a consistently pleasant experience, though not quite unforgettable. Then again, the latter was never meant to be part of a its job description.</paragraph>
