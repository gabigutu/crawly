			<paragraph>If you thought great internet experience can only be delivered by insanely expensive high-end mobile phones, maybe it's about time you reconsidered. Sony Ericsson G502 is said to be the most affordable HSDPA phone and, from what we see, the browsing and data transfer potential is all there, waiting to be unleashed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G502 is almost identical to Sony Ericsson K660, at first glance at least. A closer look at the specs of both models reveals that the G502 has shed down a few features. Not really important ones, that is, so it might be well worth it. There's nothing wrong with saving yourselves a few bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, we do happen to like the G502 design a bit better than the K660. We are still curious however, if it will be able to deliver the same performance as its K-series alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the first set of Sony Ericsson G502 images we present you. It should give you an idea of what the handset looks like in real life. Likeable, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us after the jump for more of our first impressions with the G502.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson G502 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G502 is on the compact side of handsets currently available on the market. Measuring the modest 109 x 46 x 13.5 mm and weighing only 83.5 grams, there is just a handful of handsets to take less space in you pocket than the G502.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designwise Sony Ericsson G502 is quite characteristic of the company's portfolio. Except for the somewhat unusual D-pad, you can tell it's a Sony Ericsson right away. It is rather neat and elegant with glossy front panel and opaque plastic back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of Sony Ericsson G502 is entirely made of plastic, but it still looks nice. The handset has successfully avoided the cheap feeling some other completely plastic devices just can't seem to help. Instead, it gives a rather solid impression and raises no doubts about durability and strength.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is placed at the top of the front panel right above the display. Sony Ericsson G502 features a 2" 262K-color screen of QVGA resolution. Looking at the current market trends, 2 inches is about average in this class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display excels in picture quality. Sony Ericsson is known for producing displays with good brightness and great contrast, which does whatever you're looking at look great. However the sunlight legibility issues are still standing, making the handset hard to work with outdoors on a sunny day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the D-pad and six keys arranged at its sides. Those are the two context keys, the Activity Menu key and the Clear key, along with the call and end keys. All of those are easy to work with, even if their size may seem doubtful. The wave-like layout does help a lot, with enough space between the elevated parts of the keys to ensure good tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the alphanumeric keys are concerned, we are equally pleased with Sony Ericsson G502. These aren't the largest keys around, but elevation and spacing between rows make typing quick and typo-free. The nice press feedback also earns G502 a point here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson G502 is where the M2 card slot is located. However, it's placed under the battery cover, which will have to be removed every time you want to access the memory card. Not the most comfortable solution in our point of view. On the other hand, it benefits the design of your Sony Ericsson G502.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker and the dedicated camera key are on the right of the G502. They are both rather thin but still easy to find even without turning the phone. They are also easy enough to operate, offering good tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone is completely bereft of controls. Turning to the bottom of Sony Ericsson G502, we find the lanyard eyelet, the Fast port and the microphone pinhole. As usual with Sony Ericsson handsets, the Fast port is used for connecting a charger, data cable or a set of earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of Sony Ericsson G502 features the 2 megapixel camera and the loudspeaker. The latter is quite stylishly hidden in the cleft right above the camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the battery cover open reveals the Li-Polymer battery with a capacity of 950 mAh. The manufacturer claims the impressive 10 hours of talk time and 340 hours of stand-by. We are at this point unable to comment on these numbers and will leave this for the detailed review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are so far pleased with the build quality of the Sony Ericsson G502. A few metallic parts here and there might have improved the general feel but it is still good enough as it is. Apart from being a bit too light for our taste, it fits perfectly in hand, and single-handed operation is no problem at all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface is nice and snappy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G502 is supposed to be a midrange offering but, like Sony Ericsson K660, its interface is closer to the high-end. The optimized Media Center, the Walkman 3.0 music player, and the Cyber-shot SE v2.0 camera user interface, along with Flash Lite themes support, are all on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other available features include TrackID, Smart Search, the NetFont 3.4 browser. Location services, Manage messages and message categories complete the set of niceties. Generally, Sony Ericsson G502 stays faithful to the company feature phone menu styling, and has most of the high-end features covered (save for the ones that require an accelerometer, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three soft key layout is now becoming pretty much standard for all Sony Ericsson devices and the G502 makes no exception. We really do prefer it over the two-key solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as customization is concerned, Sony Ericsson G502 supports those cool looking Flash Lite themes. With our unit we got 5 themes preinstalled and those are all pretty eye-pleasing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Media menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, and Settings icons. The current pick is highlighted in strikethrough manner and the count of included files is displayed. You can opt for the menu showing in portrait or landscape mode, depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G502 features the really cool Walkman 3.0 player. It has support for a huge number of audio formats such as: MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC +, WAV, WMA, M4A, iMelody, XMF, RealAudio 8 and MIDI file formats and sports the trademark Sony Ericsson MegaBass equalizer preset. Skeptical as we are about the need of it, we still needed to mention its presence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Media center you are able to sort music by filters including artist, album, tracks, playlists, podcasts, etc. The player can naturally be set to run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is accommodated in the media center as well. It supports fast-forwarding and rewinding as well as playing clips in slow motion. It has landscape mode, as well as settings for video size as original, auto fit and fullscreen modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of the Sony Ericsson G502 has memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS. TrackID is available too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2 megapixel camera not much of a boast<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G502 has a 2 megapixel camera with no autofocus, nor flash. The user interface is Cyber-shot SE v2.0, which earns the otherwise mediocre camera a point. The major benefits are the pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons and the large number of configurable settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface uses the toolbar layout, which is our favorite. Accessibility is quite good, with the more important settings conveniently placed. The Settings multi-menu has pretty much standard digicam looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the camera settings are displayed in two menu columns: the left displays the features and the right shows which setting is in use. Some of the available options on the menu are: Picture Quality, Review, Save to, Shutter sound and Reset counter. Unluckily, the BestPic feature is not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of the camera is not much of a brag. It will do the job for very basic imaging and that is exactly where its capabilities end. Its fixed focus makes taking photos of closely situated objects impossible. In addition there is very little detail on most of the pictures, leaving the comparatively precise colors one of the few positive things about the images taken with Sony Ericsson G502.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with Sony Ericsson G502 are in QVGA resolution at 15fps. Not worth much comment. Captured videos turning out usable will surely be a rarity. On the other hand, like with the still camera, the video interface is nice and user-friendly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is the highlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Pitched as an internet device, we were keen to check out the Sony Ericsson G502 web browser. As it turns out, it uses the rather common Access NetFront HTML browser, this time it's the latest 3.4 version. The main improvement here is the integrated virtual mouse pointer, the webpage map view, the "find on page" and "mark and copy" options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, we have seen this version of the NetFront web browser in action in some Samsung handsets but we do like it better on the Sony Ericsson G502. In all fairness, Sony Ericsson K660 was even better with its handy keypad shortcuts but the difference isn't that great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson G502 has a rather quick web browser, even content-heavy pages load with no significant lags. Panning and scrolling was quick and smooth, which can't be easily said for the Samsung devices. The speed of panning and the efficiency of the web page mini-map, controlled by the Zoom shortcut key on the keypad, are comparable to the best browsing devices out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, we are more than happy with the browsing experience the Sony Ericsson G502 delivered so far. We are to check in the full review if it will stand the test of longer use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A slightly less feature-loaded alternative of K660, Sony Ericsson G502 has some good chances of turning into a market success. It manages an excellent performance with nice and snappy interface and a decent set of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though there is little chance that you will instantly fall in love with the G502, it has nice looks and commendable ergonomics, and the user-friendliness to back those up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are all however just our first impressions after a very short time spent with the handset. We are yet to make one of our detailed reviews before we are ready with the verdict. Stay tuned in the weeks to follow, so you have the rest of your questions about Sony Ericsson G502 answered.</paragraph>
