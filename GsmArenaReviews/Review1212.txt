			<paragraph>Last year Nokia didn't announce a single new phone at the MWC, but this year they came ready to steal the show. As expected, they unveiled the Nokia Lumia 610 WP7 Tango phone, worldwide availability for the Lumia 900 and a three new Ashas, but what really sent the crowd into a roar was the Nokia 808 Pure View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mary McDowell had to repeat it twice, so that people could be sure they didn't mishear - the 808 Pure View packs an amazing sensor with a whopping 41 megapixels resolution. Yep, 41MP. The camera lets you snap 3MP, 5MP and 8MP photos and because they're saved in a new image format, you can zoom in those photos with little image quality degradation at any time after taking the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you could squeeze out almost every megapixel that the sensor has a shoot a 38MP image. That's more than most DSLRs!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Nokia Lumia 610 isn't meant to wow you, it's meant to be a highly affordable Windows Phone mobile. With an expected price of ?189, the Lumia 610 brings the price point for entry into Microsoft's mobile world way down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got three new feature phones, all of them Ashas. The Asha 302 is a QWERTY messenger with Microsoft Exchange email support. The other two - the Asha 202 and Asha 203 - are single and dual-SIM phones respectively and come with a repertoire of 40 free games - a combined worth more than the price of the phones themselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 808 PureView hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia plan to be kings of mobile imaging and have put great amounts of effort to create the 808 PureView.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its defining feature is, of course, the 41MP camera sensor, which is certain to excite as much as it will raise many eyebrows. Here's an extensive blog post that explains how the PureView camera works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the short version: by default, the Nokia 808 PureView shoots 5MP shots but does something called oversampling - 8 pixels from the sensor are combined into a single pixel in the image. This is meant to improve the image quality, but also let you zoom in up to 3x in the photo while keeping the actual resolution and not losing sharpness. You can zoom up to 4x in the 1080p videos that the PureView can record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other options for the resolution - 3MP and 8MP - which also allow to zoom in on photos (even after you've taken them), but you can also get almost all the pixels from the sensor and shoot a 38MP photo (that's for 4:3 photos, 16:9 photos go up to 34MP).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera protrudes from the back, just like it did in the N8, but the Nokia 808 PureView is bigger and noticeably thicker than the N8. Part of that is due to the 4" ClearBlack AMOLED display, which really pushes the limits of its nHD (360x640 resolution). The "hump" for the camera is something you'll have to get used to, but people seemed to really appreciate the PureView's design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the camera UI looks like:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView runs the Nokia Belle OS and is the fastest of the Belles - a single-core 1.3GHz processors. It's the fastest, smoothest Belle-running (or Anna, or Symbian, or whatever) phone we've ever handled. See it in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had another meeting with the Nokia 808 PureView. This time around we focused specifically on the camera interface and the cool zooming gesture. We also tried to show you what an image shot at the highest sensitivity setting looks like. Here, see for yourself:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got hold of two of the other color versions of the Nokia 808 PureView. Here's how the monstrous cameraphone looks in red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's what the black version looks like.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 610 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the Mobile World Congress, Nokia announced the fourth addition to the Lumia family and it's the starter Lumia 610.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have gone through great lengths to make the Lumia 610 as affordable as it could possibly be. Thanks to those efforts, the minimum system requirements for Windows Phone OS are now just 256MB of RAM on the Qualcomm 7x278 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Said to retail for just 189?, it runs Windows Phone 7.5 Mango and is powered by a so 2010 800MHz single-core Snapdragon S1 processor and the said 256MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this quad-core-frenzied Mobile World Congress, a mere 1GHz single-core processor and the scant amount of RAM may make you yawn, but the Lumia 610 behaves quite well. We did notice some lag, but that probably has more to do with the pre-release status of the units at the Nokia booth than the chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall build of the Lumia 610 is quite solid as well. The device will come in white, cyan, magenta and black. As you see, we played with the white version of the phone and there's no getting away from its charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's built around a 3.7-inch TFT LCD display with a resolution of 800x480 pixels and, although it's a not ClearBlack AMOLED display, it gets the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped several photos of the blue Lumia 610, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also managed to get our hands on a red Lumia 610. Enjoy!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes a brief video, demonstrating the Nokia Lumia 610 real-life performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 900 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 900 has been around for some time, but for AT&amp;T. At the MWC stage Stephen Elop gladly announced that the flagship device will now start shipping globally in the Q2 of 2012.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in spite of LTE not being globally available, the Nokia Lumia 900 compensates by featuring DC-HSPA, which doubles the speeds of regular HSPA+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, specs are pretty much the same as the AT&amp;T version of the device. It features a 4.3-inch ClearBlack AMOLED display, a 1.4GHz processor, 512MB of RAM, 16GB of storage and an 8MP f2.2/28 Carl Zeiss camera with dual LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike it's American cousin, the global version of the Lumia 900 won't feature NFC. It will have Gorilla Glass to protect the screen though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The following video should give you an idea of the kind of performance you can expect from the Lumia 900.</paragraph>
