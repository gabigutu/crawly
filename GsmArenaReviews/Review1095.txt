			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we review phones we try to put them in context, and tie everything up with a snapshot of the market and the closest alternatives. Now, we usually keep droids and iPhones separate because honestly they just don't mix. But every now and then, they just cannot be kept apart. Never mind the risk of explosion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So there you have it: the new iPhone 5 against the Samsung Galaxy S III. In case you're wondering why this has taken so long, we needed quality time with both phones - not just to get the reviews in, but actually use them day in, day out. Now we're ready to share our impressions and give you insights that will hopefully help decide which one is right for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones are polar opposites in terms of design - starting from size, through the design language, to the OS philosophy, those two could hardly be more different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has everything tightly locked down. Perfection, as they see it, can only be achieved in their walled garden. With Android and Samsung there's little you're not allowed to tweak (but be careful what you wish for as the saying goes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not a battle of light versus dark, it's a matter of values and beliefs - Zen-like perfection and simplicity versus nothing-is-off-limits freedom. Here's what kind of design choices that led to:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S III over iPhone 5:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new iPhone is taller and thinner than its predecessor, but keeps the same screen width and pixel density, and makes sure the hand feel is not impaired. Apple also went with a brand new connector design - the Lightning port. The inconvenience of yet another standard aside, it is better in every way and has allowed Apple engineers to build a more compact phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung, on the other hand, went all out - bigger this, more of that, let's get this in too. It adhered to industry standards and the Galaxy S III has a microSD card slot and a user-accessible battery, which makes extending the phone's life easier (e.g. expanding the storage or changing the battery when the old one starts showing its age).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The differences in ideology are apparent in the software too - Apple's design is best executed by Apple, so they made their own maps. It's not an easy task and it will take years to get them right (it's how long it has taken their competitors to get where they are today).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung on the other hand take advantage of Android's open, extendable design and piled on new features. There's barely a corner left in the OS that doesn't bear their mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start by comparing the hardware of the Apple iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S III, with the performance of the two contenders in various real-life challenges to be examined after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This will be a rollercoaster of a ride, so better get strapped in before jumping to the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple's design team must be quite fond of the iPhone 4, which explains why the new iPhone 5 (two generations newer) looks almost identical. They aimed for same but better and pretty much nailed it, barring some issues with the finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung on the other hand is keeping things fresh and is on its third design for the third generation Galaxy S phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't argue over aesthetics - you can make up your own mind on that one - but we'll take a more practical look instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the iPhone 5. Apple replaced the thick, heavy glass on the back with aluminum. This made the phone both thinner and lighter, plus aluminum is usually appreciated when it comes to high-end feel, though it's scratch-prone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device was designed with durability in mind (scratches on the back will spoil the aesthetics but won't impede functionality). It has a scratch-proof sapphire to protect the camera lens, for example. One thing we're not so sure about (other than the aluminum back) is the home button - those have been known not to age gracefully and while it feels different on the iPhone 5, only time will tell if Apple has really taken care of the issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack was moved to the bottom, so you can listen to music with the phone upside down in your pocket (that was made possible by the new, smaller connector). The advantage of this is that you can reach in and pull the phone out holding it the right way up, without having to adjust your grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new connector is pretty interesting itself - it has the awesome ability to work whichever way you plug it in (no more guessing way is up) and is more durable than its 30-pin predecessor, but requires a $30 adapter to work with older accessories (and not all of them are supported). If TV-out is what you are after, for example you will need to pay $49+tax for a lightning to HDMI cable, which sound quite ridiculous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple also went with a new SIM card standard - nanoSIM. It's quite rare at the moment, but getting a new SIM or cutting an old one to size is a fairly easy task, so we don't consider this much of a downside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung took a new turn when designing the new Galaxy S. Instead of the durable but plain-looking plastic of the S II, they went with hyperglaze finish. The curves of the phone make it feel thinner and improve the handling, but it just might feel too plasticy for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say what you will about the plastic of the Galaxy flagship phone, but one thing no one can deny is that you get more color options than you do with the iPhone (which sticks to black or white despite the palette of colors on the iPod touch).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While scratching the back is not a problem, the screen seems to be a bigger worry. Even though both phones' screens are protected by Gorilla Glass (GG 2 on the Samsung), according to the first drop tests we saw, the screen on the Galaxy S III is a bit easier to crack than that of the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The port positioning on the Galaxy S III is traditional - 3.5mm audio jack on top and a microUSB at the bottom (if you're going to have docks and cradles, that's where you need to put the USB port, really).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the microUSB cables can be plugged in only one way, they are much easier to find. And with the right adapter, you get either HDMI or USB Host thanks to the MHL functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned the sapphire cover on the iPhone 5 that protects the camera. The Galaxy S III doesn't have that, in fact, the camera protrudes slightly making it even more vulnerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III uses the increasingly popular microSIM format and it does have a microSD card slot, which pretty much makes paying extra for a 32GB or 64GB version unnecessary. You can always pop in a 32GB or 64GB card - not only will you be actually getting more storage in the end, but you'll be saving quite a lot of cash, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're still looking under the hood, we might as well mention the battery too. It has 2100mAh capacity, more than the 1440mAh of the iPhone 5, but the custom-made Apple A6 chipset might be able to beat the Exynos 4412 Quad inside the Galaxy S III (Cortex-A9 cores are getting old and so is the Mali-400 GPU and their power-efficiency is not up to par).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no contest here really. The iPhone 5 handles like something you bought from a jewelry shop and it looks way better than the Galaxy S III. It's also way more compact so even with the build quality issues it has, it still comes as a winner here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPhone 5</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III and the Apple iPhone 5 both have 16:9 screens and both are bigger than those of their predecessors, but that's where the similarities end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III has a 4.8" Super AMOLED display of 720p resolution and Gorilla Glass 2, while the iPhone 5 has a 4" IPS TFT display of 640 x 1136 resolution and Gorilla glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's concentrate on the size for a moment. The S III screen has 44% more surface area, so while the difference in diagonals is only 0.8", it makes a huge difference in usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra size comes at the price of sharpness - while the iPhone 5 has a slightly lower resolution, its pixel density is 326ppi (same as on the 4 and 4S), while the Galaxy S III has 306ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more to it than that, however. The iPhone 5's screen has an RGB matrix, while the Super AMOLED on the Galaxy S III is PenTile with only two sub-pixels per pixel. The following macro shots taken under a microscope should help illustrate the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us explain what's going on - the second set of images is of white text on a black background with lines 1px thick. To make white you need all three of the primary colors (Red, Green and Blue), but since the PenTile only has two of those for each pixel it needs to "borrow" subpixels from neighboring pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, a 1px thick white line on the Galaxy S III becomes 1.5 px wide (three sub-pixels total, each pixel is 2 sub-pixels wide). This is an extreme example, of course, but it does affect sharpness in real-life usage too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To the naked eye, the differences are less apparent but they are still there. If you know what to look for, you can spot the crosshatch effect of the PenTile matrix, but you probably won't notice it in daily use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles on both screens are great, but if we had to nitpick the iPhone 5 shows very slight contrast loss while the Galaxy S III starts showing a blue-green tint. Those things are really only noticeable at extreme angles and even then not much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for colors, the Super AMOLED screen shows more saturated colors, which is a blessing or a curse, depending on who you ask. You do have an option to control the saturation, so we're willing to go with blessing. The iPhone 5's color rendering is excellently accurate, which is pretty great, but in some cases it's not as punchy as the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other important considerations are the brightness and contrast of the display, which strongly affect the viewing experience. Combine that with the reflectivity of the screen and you get the sunlight legibility, which is very important for devices that are much used outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5 scores two victories - it's brighter, pushing out almost twice the lumens as the Galaxy S III and it is better under direct sunlight. The superior brightness is no surprise - LCDs are typically brighter than AMOLEDs. However, AMOLEDs usually offer better sunlight legibility, so topping the Galaxy S III is a big win for the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong, those two are in the Top 3, coming behind only the Nokia 808 PureView, and are two of the best screens we've tested yet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Where the Galaxy S III wins by default is contrast - it's theoretically infinite as the black levels are 0. However, with a 1000+ contrast for the iPhone 5's screen, the practical difference is very small (unless you're in a dark room, so there are no light sources to reflect off the screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as image quality goes, both are great but overall the iPhone 5 has an edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is only one variable in the equation though - screen size is very important as well. The Galaxy S III display dwarfs the iPhone 5 one and makes it pale in comparison by the virtue of its sheer size. It offers a lot more room, which is great for web browsing, gaming, watching videos and whatnot. The smaller screen may have helped the iPhone 5 is the previous chapter as it allowed it to remain far more compact, but it lets it down here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screens indirectly affect another aspect of the two phones that we'll cover next - battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Awesome features are great, but a phone with a flat battery is about as useful as a paperweight. This is why a long-lasting battery is a major consideration when buying a new phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We test for three use cases - talking, browsing and watching videos - and give each phone a battery rating, which is an estimated time between going from full charge to empty if you do each of those activities for an hour each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin, let's check the stats. The iPhone 5 has a 1,440mAh battery, while the Galaxy S III has a beefier 2,100mAh battery. Both phones use chipsets designed by their respective companies, so let's see how well they did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good, old-fashioned talking is either the most important feature of a phone or a secondary feature, depending on who you ask. Still, if you didn't care about telephony you'd probably be reading an iPod Touch vs. Galaxy Player comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger battery on the S III keeps it going for 10 hours and 15 minutes, but the iPhone 5's modem proves very efficient and its talk time is 20 minutes shy of the 9 hours mark. In either case you're unlikely to run the battery dry with just voice calls, but if you forgot to charge your phone, the S III will give you more call time than the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The mobile web browsing has been eating into traditional desktop browsing for several years now and is a defining feature of smartphones. Apple pulled off a small miracle and the iPhone 5 can surf the web over Wi-Fi for 10 hours straight, while the Galaxy S III last "only" 6 and a half hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that anyone would browse the web on a phone for 6 hours straight, but you have to keep in mind that a smartphone gets used for a number of things throughout the day. The more battery-efficient browsing on the iPhone 5 will leave more battery for other activities (e.g. it will balance the scales if you talk and browse a lot).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that the iPhone has a 16:9 screen, watching videos is finally comfortable (practically all new content uses that aspect ratio). Plus, video playback is one of the areas where making the screen taller really makes a difference (it doesn't do much for web browsing, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But speaking of size, the Samsung Galaxy S III clearly has the advantage here (a TV set is never too big). Anyway, the playback times for both phones are separated by about 40 minutes with the advantage going to the iPhone. That's the length of a single episode of a "one hour" show (not counting breaks).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With advantages in two out of the three categories, the Apple iPhone 5 manages to snag a narrow victory, but the Samsung Galaxy S III is close behind thanks to efficient standby. While you'll probably be charging both phones at least every other day, the iPhone 5 will give you more web browsing time, while the Galaxy S III will offer some extra talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A hardware design difference comes into play here - it's quite easy to carry a second battery for the Galaxy S III and pop it in when the first one is depleted, doubling the battery life (or tripling it - third party batteries are quite cheap). With the iPhone, the only way to up the battery life beyond what's offered out of the box is to use one of those unsightly extension packs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5 are devices capable of doing truly amazing things but we shouldn?t forget that they are still phones, so telephony and messaging is a pretty important feature to get right. Samsung and Apple have both polished their telephony experience over the generations of smartphones they?ve produced, so let?s start examining the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dials on the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III are pretty standard affair. You get a big dial pad bringing you very thumb-friendly buttons to press. However, once you start dialing a number, Samsung?s smart dial kicks in and start searching names and numbers simultaneously. If it hits any matches, the dialer displays the contact photo and number of the first and, if there are more an arrow next to it, which lets you see the rest. Overall smart dialing is a real time-saver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On either handset you can also search contacts using the universal search tool from your homescreen. The Galaxy S III has something extra there, too ? since it?s an Android smartphone, it lets you make widgets of your favorite contacts, which are always just a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that?s not the only telephony trick, the Samsung Galaxy S III has up its sleeve. We find the Direct Call feature pretty cool. It lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts, reading or composing a message. There?s also flip to mute, which lets you mute the ringer and disable the vibration by simply turning your phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another trick in the TouchWiz bag is the very advanced black list. You can add numbers to it, or set it to automatically reject calls from phones starting with, ending with or containing some preset numbers. The Apple iPhone 5 and iOS6 don?t pack a similar feature out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to in-call quality, the competitors are nothing short of great. The Apple iPhone 5 boasts a triple-microphone setup and, delivers crisp in-call voice quality. The Samsung Galaxy S III has only two mics but still did quite well in that aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we included our traditional loudspeaker test that we conducted on the Samsung Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the user interface, the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III cover the basics giving you the recent call log, list of favorites as well as quick access to the keypad. The Galaxy S III is further enhanced with clever shortcuts in the call log, phonebook, messaging and just about every other contact listing -- a swipe to the right starts a call, while swiping to the left starts a text message. Just like the smart dial, once you get used to it, it?s a real time-saver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally video calls ? the Samsung Galaxy S III supports native video calls, which mean that you can call any other handset that supports the feature. The iPhone 5 lacks that, but features FaceTime, which is the Apple equivalent. FaceTime does offer higher quality than regular video calls, but it?s reach is far reduced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a pretty easy choice here - the Galaxy S III offers so many more features that it had no trouble walking away with the win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of messaging, the differences between the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III aren't substantial. Both support basic SMS and MMS messages, allow you to store virtually unlimited amount of messages, display text messages as a conversation and support multiple recipients.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use voice input on both smartphone to dictate a message, rather than typing it. After the Jelly Bean the Galaxy S III has an advantage here, though ? the voice typing can be made to work offline on the Android smartphone. All you have to do is download the needed language packs once and you can use the feature even without data connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of typing, the keyboards on both devices are pretty. On the Galaxy S III you get the benefit of the larger screen, while on the iPhone 5 there?s the really cleverly thought out iOS keyboard, which many users swear by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It really does all it can to offset the screen estate advantage, although it lacks some extra functionality that the Samsung keyboard does. There?s no Swype-like input, for example, or the option to switch between letters and other characters with a horizontal swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the Galaxy S III has access to a host of alternative keyboards from the Google Play Store, whereas the iPhone 5 is limited to its stock keyboard for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple?s trump in the messaging department is the iMessage service. It lets you exchange instant messages between iOS-running ?Gadgets either over Wi-Fi or 3G. The service supports plain text as well as multimedia (videos, pictures, sound) messages. Additionally, each conversation is synced with the iCloud service making it available on all iDevices, including the Mac OS X-running ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has its own iMessage rival in the face of ChatON, but that?s neither as nicely integrated, nor nearly as popular, so it?s pretty useless at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s too close to call here really ? the two are just great for messaging and picking one over the other is strictly a matter of personal preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as video playback is concerned, it's hard to disagree that (screen) size does matter and the bigger it is, the better the experience is. The Samsung Galaxy S III not take a huge advantage of its 4.7-inch Super AMOLED display, but also builds on top of it with one of the best default mobile video player apps we've come across.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's clear that Samsung developers have really put a lot of effort in this one. It supports virtually every video format you can think of (even in FullHD), starting with the basic .WMV and .AVI (XviD and DivX) going through more demanding H.264 (and H.263) and .MPEG4 and finishing with the open-standard VP8 (WebM). The Galaxy S III doesn't break a sweat with large files either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you start playing a video, you can choose between three view modes (original, full screen and fit-to-screen). However, this only scratches the surface on the things you can adjust - video brightness, color tone, play speed and toggling outdoor visibility on or off. The video player also benefits from Samsung's SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III also made a good impression when it offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. Most video players don't bother and just look for a file with the exact same name as the video file (save for the extension).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the default video player iOS 6 is packing on the iPhone 5, things aren't so rosy. Granted, with its 4-inch screen boasting an aspect ratio of 16:9, watching videos is far more enjoyable than on any of the previous iPhones, but video format support is extremely limited. DivX and XviD videos are a no-no, and don't count on .WMV playing either. To play those, you can have iTunes convert them beforehand, which is a bit tedious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for options for video viewing, the iPhone 5 video player offers fit-to-screen and full screen modes. There aren't color tone adjustments. Also, don't count on subtitle support, unless the subtitles are built into the video file itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth mentioning the list view modes both video player apps have to offer. Samsung has overdone themselves in this aspect and as a result the Galaxy S III offers you grid, list, folders and nearby devices view modes. The grid view is the most eye-catching as it creates video thumbnails that actually preview the videos they represent, instead of showing static images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Galaxy S III, the iPhone 5 simply offers you a uninspired list of videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's even more to the Galaxy S III video playback capabilities. Pop up play feature enables you to watch a video in a small floating window that stays on top of other apps, which you currently use. Finally, the chapter preview breaks down a video in several; scenes and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view we mentioned).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another easy pick - the Apple iPhone 5 gets blown away by its competitor here. The only arguments it has on its side are the slightly longer battery life and the tiny bit more accurate colors, but it remains a distant second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio playback and audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the history of tech companies, there are very few ones that can match the expertise of Apple when it comes to audio playback. Ever since the guys at Cupertino launched the first iPod back in 2001, they've been constantly refining and enhancing the experience of its audio players. The culmination of those 11 years of constant refinement is packed in the iPhone 5 and its Music app (formerly known as iPod).The interface is polished, simple and so straightforward that an infant could use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music app on the iPhone 5 enters funk mode once you flip the phone into landscape, initiating Cover Flow. It lists all the albums from the library - a tap on an album thumb lists all the tracks in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you choose a song, the player brings up the Now Playing screen. It's clean in design and packs all the controls you'll ever need when dealing with music. There are also other notable features such as an equalizer with presets, playlists and different sorting modes (artists, songs, albums. genre, compilations or composers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S III's music player doesn't beat around the bush either and sports the same array of features like the iPhone 5's. Where it manages to differ and get an edge is the Music Square feature, which automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name). From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz Music app also boasts Samsung's SoundAlive technology with 7.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any iPhone, there are three ways to manage your music - on a computer with iTunes, direct purchase in the iTunes app on your iPhone, or iCloud sync (only with the more recent generations). On a computer with the iTunes software you can create playlists and sync them with your iPhone. It has to be one computer though - each new computer sync will overwrite your old music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you buy songs directly on your iPhone (via the iTunes Store), you can either sync them with your computer or download them again when you log in with the Apple ID you bought them with. The third way is the iCloud. If your Music sync is turned on, then you can always download your music library (whatever the reason - restore, new device, deleted, etc.), which is really handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has developed its own ways to let users acquire and manage their music. The Kies software is Samsung's direct answer to Apple's iTunes and follows the same recipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On of the Kies key features is Wireless Sync, which uses Wi-Fi to sync the music, photos and videos on your smartphone. Mind you, you'll need to install the Samsung Kies app on the Galaxy S III for that to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, while using iTunes to set up and upload media to the iPhone is obligatory, you don't really need Kies, as the Galaxy S III has Mass storage. This means uploading your music with simple copy&amp;paste from your computer. Still, if you want to organize it through a program, Samsung enables you to do so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like Apple, Samsung is also having its very own music store dubbed Music Hub, where you can purchase from over 19 million songs and upload your existing music to the cloud. This allows you to stream it to your device and listen it on the go. And while not strictly a Galaxy S III feature we'll mention that the Google Play Store is also an alternative, when it comes to purchasing music, TV episodes and movies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S III and Apple iPhone 5 music players have great file compatibility and support most formats out of the box. Great quality .mp3 files with high bitrate are not problem for the flagship devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the iPhone 5's music player doesn't get along very well with FLAC files, so you'll need an (often paid) alternative app to play them. The Galaxy S III on the other hand handles those trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S III are quite evenly matched in terms of audio quality, too. The Samsung smartphone has slightly better stereo when used with an active external equalizer, but the rest of the readings are basically identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would still give the nod to the iPhone 5 here, as it's output is slightly louder than that of the Galaxy S III. We have to admit that the gap isn't as big as it was on the iPhone 4S and the Galaxy S II, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The iPhone 5 is the epitome of point-and-shoot, but the deceptively simple interface of the camera actually hides a few of advanced features. There's tap focus, geotagging, HDR mode and the new Panorama mode. One thing that camera enthusiasts appreciate and the Galaxy S III doesn't have (not even the Nokia 808 PureView) is the AE/AF lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S III camera has every feature Samsung devs could think of. The customizable UI will help bring out the ones you use most often, but there are so many features it will take you a lot of time to go through them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III matches the iPhone 5 in that it has HDR and Panorama modes, but it also adds things like burst shot, adjustable image properties (ISO, exposure compensation, etc.), scenes, share shot and beauty shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some crops to highlight the differences between the two cameras. The iPhone 5's camera is a bit sharper, though it helps that its field of view is narrower than that of the Galaxy S III (which fits more of the scene and thus there're fewer pixels to describe each object).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both show fairly accurate colors, though the Apple smartphone gets closer to the real look of the scene. The iPhone 5 usually tries to preserve detail in the shadows, while the Galaxy S III is okay with sacrificing detail in the shadows to try and keep some in the highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here are the full resolution photos we used for the crops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Photo quality comparison tool has some standard shots with both phones if you feel like a round of pixel peeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPhone 5 vs. Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In difficult lighting situations, you can always go for the HDR mode. It requires a firm hold and it's not suitable for fast action scenes, but it can make a big difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones manage to bring out detail in the really bright parts of the image (the clouds with the sun behind them), but the Galaxy S III does a better job of bringing in detail in the shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast of the HDR shots is on the conservative side, so you can edit the photos later, but the photos look a little "flatter" than the ones from the iPhone 5, which produces images of more limited dynamic range, but better contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some more crops to show how each phone does in HDR mode (photos were downscaled to 25% before the crops were made).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have a look at the full-res shots too if you want to see HDR photos at 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and keep in mind that if you point the iPhone 5 camera at a bright light source, you might get purple flare in your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, lets take the Panorama features of both phones for a spin - and quite a spin it is. Both cameras managed to capture virtually the same area but the iPhone 5 panorama has double the resolution of the Galaxy S III one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5 also did a cleaner stitch - you can see the stitching artifact in the middle of the S III panorama. The Galaxy S III, however, handled the transition better from well-lit to dark in the panorama.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it's sharper images with better white balance versus some extra functionality. On one hand very few people will use those extra camera settings, so they probably shouldn't count for much. On the other, if you are looking from close enough to be able to spot the differences in image quality (things are really close) you might be among those few people. Still, we'd give the iPhone 5 the nod here, but keep in mind that it's a win by the narrowest of margins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPhone 5</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video cameras of both the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III top out at 1080p@30fps video capture, but one of the major differences between the two is that this is the only recording option the Apple phone offers, while the S III will do 720p and go all the way down to QVGA over three more steps (this lets you trade image quality for storage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones shoot at a bitrate of 17Mbps, making for a smooth frame rate of 30fps. However the Galaxy S III captures stereo, while the iPhone 5 (despite having three microphones) does mono recording. The image quality is similar, but there are important differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most visible one is the field of view - the Samsung Galaxy S III manages to capture more of the scene, so you can fit more people in one shot, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, because there's more content for the same number of pixels, the Galaxy S III is at a bit of a disadvantage, but both cameras offer excellent image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that became immediately obvious is that the iPhone 5 is better at picking workable image settings automatically - we shot both videos without touching any settings and the Galaxy S III overexposed and blew out some of the highlights. So, for best results with the S III, you might have to fiddle with the exposure compensation before you start shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the samples we shot for this comparison. Don't forget to pick 1080p and view them in full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, pixel peepers can head to the Video quality compare too to get a better look. We frame the test shots there to fit the exact same parts of the scenes, which takes out the different FoV out of the equation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPhone 5 vs. Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5 offers AF/AE lock, which can be great in dynamic scenes where the autofocus and auto exposure would get confused. On the Galaxy S III you can lock the focus, but not the auto-exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One option that both phones have is video stabilization. We put the two on a stand and shot video simultaneously on both to see which one did a better job of smoothing out hand shake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it didn't look like it on the phone screens while we were shooting, the iPhone 5 did a better job. The result is not perfect but smooth enough, while the Galaxy S III produced jerky videos. It's especially visible during panning, the phone is so keen to keep the video pointed in the same direction that it fights the panning at first and then jumps to catch up when it can't compensate anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's exactly the video stabilization that saves the Apple iPhone 5 from defeat here. The narrower field of view and the mono sound were disappointing, but smartphone are rarely used with a tri-pod, so the ability to reduce the camera shake effect comes in welcome on more than one occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo viewing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already discussed the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III cameras, but how good are those devices when it comes to displaying the photos they've taken? How easy is it to import already existing photos from another device to those handsets? Let's have a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones have enough muscle under the hood to provide more than smooth and fluid browsing experience. Panning and zooming is smooth as you can get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The story of which one is better at actually showing images is one of two chapters. If you like just casually showing images to your friends the Galaxy S III is your best bet. The Samsung flagship comes with a screen that isn't only larger, but also more saturated and with far superior contrast due to its Super AMOLED nature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results is extremely vibrant colors and livelier images. Even some very dull sceneries look as if they have come out of a fairy tale on the Samsung Galaxy S III. You can naturally use the color tone option in the settings menu to tune down the effect, if you feel like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Apple iPhone 5 is much better suited for more professional applications. The Apple smartphone's screen has much more accurate color reproduction, which makes is much better for previewing photos before printing them, for example. It's also sharper, which benefits the picture browsing experience, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting the photos onto the device is another story and the Galaxy S III shines with its mass storage and USB host capability allowing you to easily transfer photos from and to the handset. A simple USB on-the-go cable stands between you and a flash drive, memory card reader or even a portable hard drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III also allows you to easily sync images from your Picasa albums and various 3rd party services like Dropbox let you automatically upload any images you capture to the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5 might lack mass storage mode, but it has the other bases covered as well. The camera connection kit lets you download images from SD cards, thumb drives or even other memory formats if you have a card reader at hand. You don't get full access to the file system of the connected storage, just an import button, but that should do on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Photo Stream for automatically uploading your recently shot photos and iCloud for backing and syncing your albums. Dropbox integration is supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picking a winner here is rather hard as it really boils down to personal preference. Accurate colors or livelier images ? everyone needs to make that call for themselves. The opinions around the office are divided, too, so we'll just call this a tie. No matter which of the two you pick though, you'll be able to browse, share and sync your photo collection effortlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to Internet on a mobile device, the things that have the biggest impact on the experience are the screen, the performance and the browser. There are other considerations, of course, like connectivity (e.g. LTE) and battery life, we'll cover those too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we start with the screens. We already know the deal, the Samsung Galaxy S III has a 44% bigger screen, which makes a huge difference when browsing desktop sites. The iPhone 5 screen is slightly sharper, which improves the readability of tiny text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the web browser, Mobile Safari beats the Samsung-modified Android Browser at synthetic benchmarks, but the droid does offer more functionality. We quite like the experimental Quick controls too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is being phased out on mobile devices, but you can still run it, even in Jelly Bean. You also get to choose a different browser - Apple doesn't really allow 3rd party browser engines to run on iOS, so at best you get reskinned Safari with some extra features and slower JavaScript.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't set them as the default browser either, so links will keep opening in Safari. Even so, iOS users are more inclined to switch Safari for something else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Android, you can go for Chrome, which is faster in benchmarks and provides a different user interface. Firefox is also available and it brings add-on capabilities, something which its desktop counterpart is famous for. Then there's Opera too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three of these browsers allow you to sync tabs between your desktop and your phone, something Apple just added to iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, all Apple iPhone 5 versions have LTE connectivity, while not all Galaxy S IIIs do. If that's important to you, you should make sure you're buying the LTE-enabled version of the Galaxy S III (model number I9305).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for battery life, the iPhone 5 has the clear advantage when browsing the web. It can last 3 and a half hours longer than the Galaxy S III, so if you spend a lot of time surfing the net on your phone, you might appreciate battery life more than the extra screen size that the S III offers (or carry a spare battery for the droid).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the two are very close here - the iPhone leads in performance and longevity, but lags behind in functionality and . What clinches the win for the Galaxy S III here is the larger screen which makes a huge difference - you can fit more content on the screen without damaging readability and that's a real boost to usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mobile gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mobile games have started rivaling their console counterparts in terms of graphics and fanbase. The Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S III are two high-volume devices with some of the fastest chipsets on the market, so they'll handle everything from casual games to high-end 3D games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a difference in marketplaces between the two OSes, which isn't really new. Android games are most often free or ad-supported with paid ad-free versions. In the iOS App Store, $0.99 games are the more common sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the advantage isn't purely in Android's court - many popular games launch on iOS first and come to Android later (or launch simultaneously, but the other way around is rare) and there are still some high-end games that are iOS-exclusive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones suffer a bit from other devices in their respective ecosystems. The iPhone 5, for example, changed the screen aspect ratio and quite a few games have not been updated and run with black bars on the side, so they're not really making full use of the extra screen real estate (which is already pretty limited).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III has its own headaches - 720p screens are quite popular in Android already, but some games still haven't been adapted and will be upscaled to fit, which spoils the image quality somewhat (but isn't fatal). The bigger issue is that some high-profile games are Tegra 3-exclusive because of NVIDIA's close relations with game devs, meaning the S III is barred from games that would otherwise run on the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple's iCloud gives the iPhone 5 an advantage over Android phones as it syncs game progress, so you can easily pick up where you left off. That is helpful when you have more than one iOS device and also comes into play when upgrading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, though, the Galaxy S III wins points for its screen - since most games use on-screen controls, the big screen allows you to position your thumbs comfortably and still have good visibility. Not to mention that a larger screen allows you to enjoy those rich graphics even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of controls, the Galaxy S III has proven a wiz at using various console controllers - the ones from the three major consoles (Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii) are easy to get working and there are games that support them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throw in a HDMI MHL adapter and you can use the S III as an Android game console. The Ouya project got a lot of attention, so the Android games that support hardware controllers should just keep increasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the iPhone 5 also offers TV-out out functionality and there are some dedicated hardware controllers for the iPhone, but you can't just pick one from your console and use that. Also, since the iPhone 5 is taller than the 4 and 4S and sports a different connector many of the current iPhone controllers might not be compatible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again the call it tough here - the Galaxy S III is a device better suited for gaming, but the iPhone 5 ecosystem leads Android by some distance (we assume that if you really are into mobile gaming, you wouldn't mind paying for them). We'd call this one a tie, but if any of your favorite game titles are iOS-exclusive, you should read that as an iPhone 5 win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Maps and navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back in the summer, Apple dumped Google Maps to debut its own, in-house mapping service and app dubbed simply Maps. Just hours after iOS 6 rolled out, users started complaining about the service's weak map coverage, lack of transit information, totally messed up POIs and a few more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its shortcomings, Apple Maps is rather good-looking and is packed with handy features. One of them is the built-in navigation. It works even on the lockscreen or in the background, while you are in other apps. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also sourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also turn-by-turn guidance real-time traffic updates, local search, Yelp reviews and the impressive Flyover 3D views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Flyover mode is a great bonus for your viewing pleasure. When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is extremely limited, but hopefully more areas will be added later on. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III gets Google Maps as its default maps app. Being around for ages, Google offers detailed (and accurate) mapping information complete with cool features like Street View mode and voice-guided navigation (although in just 39 countries to Apple's 56). There's also public transport and pedestrian navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Street View lets you enjoy a 360-degree view of the surrounding in a particular area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like Apple Maps, Google Maps makes use of vector graphics for displaying maps, making them lightweight and easy on the phone. Where the Android service comes in front though, is the offline caching feature, allowing you to save a particular area for times when Internet connection isn't at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, provided you're signed into Google, the location you've searched on the Google Maps website will be synchronized with the app on Android and will pop up as recent searches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some parts of the world, Apple's Maps relies on the OpenStreetMap Foundation data, however the main supplier of mapping data for the service is TomTom, but it's more than obvious by this point that the map data is not up to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, being in the mapping data business for quite some time and having state-of-the-art data centers to serve it has its benefits and Google is taking full advantage of its assets. For now Apple is playing catch-up with its rather messy entry into the deep waters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely, iOS Maps will be polished eventually, but that will take quite some time. For now, though, they are way behind and when even Tim Cook suggests you try some of the alternatives, we can only pick one winner here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Those hoping for an X-is-better-than-Y-period-! answer will be disappointed. The way the crowd at a boxing match will feel about a win on points instead of a knockout. Like someone running for office wins debates to lose an election.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not get carried away though. It's just phones. Worse yet, they're soon to be last season's phones. Yet, we all vote for them with our hearts, minds and, ultimately, wallets. So, which one is better?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know you look to our conclusions for buying advice and some kind of closure. We don't think you need to look any further. Just this once, go a few pages back. Each individual category was won by either the Apple iPhone 5 or the Samsung Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's up to you to go over the ones that matter to you and tally the score. And don't be swayed by popular opinion. The smartphone is probably the most personal thing you own (it knows your friends, has your photos, goes everywhere with you), so it's up to you to decide which one is best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before you look at the price of either phone, there's one last thing to consider - how invested you are in either ecosystem already. For example, you may have iPhone accessories worth a few hundred dollars (though the iPhone 5 pretty much wiped the slate clean on this one), or maybe various apps you've bought and don't want to lose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That leads us to price and the difference is by no means negligible. SIM-free the iPhone 5 is probably the most expensive smartphone on the market right now, topping the Samsung Galaxy S III in Europe by almost 200 euros.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But then, resale value is another thing you might want to look at, after all it won't be long before the next Galaxy S and iPhone generation is out, tempting you to upgrade. Of course, you can easily use the Galaxy S III and iPhone 5 for a couple of years and not feel too far behind the flagship du jour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some would say that the most damning verdict for the iPhone 5 is that it's trading blows with a smartphone that came to the market 5 months before it, instead of wiping the floor with it. Others will point to the fact that the Galaxy S III took three months to achieve the sales numbers that the Apple flagship already has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the iPhone 5 vs. Galaxy S III argument comes down to portability vs. screen size, LCD vs. AMOLED, closed vs. open, Apple vs. Samsung. The latter have been in and out of court for a while now but this particular dispute won't be settled in a courtroom. You'll be the judge, so the winner doesn't have to be the one with the better lawyers.</paragraph>
