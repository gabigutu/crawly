			<paragraph>Smoking hot body, brilliant looks, user-friendly interface and almost no value for money, but still packing quite a punch - Nokia 6600 fold is exactly the kind of meal to order from an unpriced menu. The OLED screen, the cool magnetic flip and the mirror front panel just make it all the sweeter and kind of make sure it feels more at home in designer handbags than pockets. Now, that's where we come in with a little bit of good sense chicks will ignore anyway. And who knows, they may be right in the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bold color scheme and intriguing one-touch flip, Nokia 6600 fold sure knows how to make a good first impression. The gradated mirror front looks and feels extra smooth and the exotic OLED display adds another touch of exclusivity. And it definitely isn't a "Mirror, mirror on the wall, is there anyone there at all".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A double tap on the opaque glazed front will light up the hidden secondary screen for time and missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold won't be on very amicable terms with a couple of Samsung handsets that we know. The L310 and L320 are targeting the ladies, sporting a number of absolutely essential applications like Shopping list, Fragrance type and Calories consumption. They both look extra slick and share the defining feature of 6600 fold - modest specs and a high price tag. They are however yet to be released, so we can't be specific enough about their retail price points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung L310 &#x2022; Samsung L320</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have their own agenda in the style-driven segment. LG KF510 is a sweet-looking slider for the budget-minded (around 180 euro or 250 US dollars), while the Black series flagship LG KF750 Secret will set you 300 euro (410 US dollars) back. For that price however you get quite a package, including a 5-megapixel camera, tempered-glass display, touch navigation and slow-mo video. Sounds a bargain to us but the flip form factor admirers will probably think otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG KF510 &#x2022; LG KF750 Secret</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson don't seem much of threat in the fashion niche but maybe W707 could be a worthy challenger if it ever gets released. There are a few handsets that are at least worth considering for their superior functionality and similar asking price, while others offer decent looks for much less cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W980 is a great-looking music package. You will have to part with about 315 euro (450 US dollars) to get hold of one of those. The S500 (130 euro/190 US dollars) and Z555 (105 euro/150 US dollars) are the budget offerings from Sony Ericsson that seem to target the fashion-savvy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson W980 &#x2022; Sony Ericsson S500 &#x2022; Sony Ericsson Z555</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Nokia 6600 fold seems to have quite some alternatives within its own family, with the Supernova lineup venturing to push the l'Amour collection aside. The one to come closest is probably Nokia 7510 Supernova, which only trades the OLED screen and tap functionality for Xpress-on covers. It will retail at about 180 euro (255 US dollars) before taxes and subsides, once it's launched in Q4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 7510 Supernova</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well that should be enough for a round of window-shopping, so let's get back to our Nokia 6600 sweetie. The hardware specs and exterior continue on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold comes in a medium-sized box and the stuff inside is hardly going to impress you. There is no complimentary memory card this time, but we found a carrying case instead. It has its own instruction manual (!), which might as well be as high-tech as it gets for the targeted segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nicely looking two-piece handsfree set is supplied. The keys on the remote are large and tactile enough, so you can quickly get used to operating it without even looking. The supplied headset also comes complete with three sets of ear buds of varying size, so you can pick the one that suits you best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last items in the retail package are the mandatory DC charger, a microUSB cable and an instruction manual.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6600 fold 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold stands at 87.7 x 44 x 15.9 mm with a volume of mere 52 cc. These numbers are near spectacular in clamshell terms. The 6600 fold is an impressively compact and solid flip. The weight of 110 g may sound unexpected but the extra friendly grip and exquisite exterior do pay off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite obviously, and thankfully, with Nokia 6600 slide we can't be blamed for focusing too much on looks. Smooth and elegant, the handset is one adorable little piece of gear. The exterior is absolutely striking and the inside is trying to stay on par, except for a few eye-hurting details. For one, the magnetic plates for the flip could've been a lot more subtle. They take more space than seems necessary leaving less for the really important elements - the keypad and the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed, Nokia 6600 fold surely is a treat with almost seamless casing and color gradation. There is a status light on the top of the front panel, placed right above the hidden display. It indicates standby mode, missed events, alarms and reminders, calls, and low battery, and can also be disabled if the user prefers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double-tapping on the front wakes up the external display. Missed calls or unread messages are indicated by a status icon. The currently running music track or FM radio station also get displayed. If you aren't listening to any music, nor have you got any missed calls or messages, the clock gets shown. You can opt between either digital or analogue clock on the outer display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of the 6600 fold allows you to mute an incoming call or an alarm by double-tapping on its front surface. Double-tapping once on an incoming call mutes the ringer, while repeating it rejects the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of Nokia 6600 fold we find the microUSB port. It has no protective cap, which is both an unpleasant sight and a guarantee to get filled with dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet of the phone is at the bottom and the strap itself threads under the battery cover in a neatly designed loop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charger plug is located on the right of Nokia 6600 fold, next to the flip key. Pressing that key lets the phone unfold thanks to the built-in electromagnetic system. The flip is smooth and even, though some members of our team found it somewhat slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inside of the phone reveals the main display and the keypad, the performance of which we will save for latter. Above the display are the video-call camera and the ambient light sensor. The earpiece is nestled beneath the top magnetic plate, while the loudspeaker grill is all the way down on the metallic chin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of Nokia 6600 fold hosts the 2 megapixel camera lens, which is complemented by a dual-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover is a rather tricky job, especially if you don't have long nails. This is in fact one of the hardest phones to open we've come across recently. Under the hood is an 860 mAh Li-ion BL-4CT battery. The manufacturer commits to 4 hours of talk time or 300 hours of stand-by. In reality, it provides about three days of mild-to-moderate use, which is somewhat short of impressive but certainly ok.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the battery lies the microSD card slot, which means no hot-swap for the 6600 fold. This is quite inconvenient but we guess 6600 fold users will just have to live with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold handles 8GB cards problem-free and that's some consolation. Even if the Nokia website claims 4GB card compatibility at most, our test showed no issues with currently the largest available microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-quality of Nokia 6600 fold is commendable and the exquisite looks are a great asset. Extra elegant without imposing, the handset is a neat and adorable accessory. Fingerprints are of course an issue but the likeable flip responds with disarming charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compact and heavy handset handles sweetly, single-handed usage being almost too easy. Every key is easily reachable and that's hardly a surprise, given the extra friendly dimensions of the clamshell.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>OLED display - the future is shaping<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main display of Nokia 6600 fold is a 2.13" 16M-color unit of QVGA resolution, using the OLED technology. Picture quality is remarkable, with contrast levels well beyond the reach of any TFT rivals. Colors are of unmatched vibrancy, even though brightness isn't really great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side, the sunlight legibility of the OLED unit isn't nearly as good as what we're used to with Nokia handsets, making the phone somewhat hard to use outside in the bright sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hidden external screen has a 1.36"diagonal and a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. It is also an OLED unit but it's hard to judge quality due to its specific limited graphical nature. For one, all the readings it displays are perfectly legible but then again, none of those involve complicated graphics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is really good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are extremely pleased with the keypad of Nokia 6600 fold. Keys are really large with small but discernible borders between different rows. The middle column has a different finish, so it's another boost to ergonomics. The level of press feedback is more than adequate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing is really great on the 6600 fold and the only complaints we have are with the D-pad. The problem is that its confirming center is smallish and hard to press with larger fingers. Having in mind though that the phone will be mostly used by ladies, this won't probably be that much of an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is nice and even, causing no problems using the phone in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: neat and quick<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold uses the typical feature phone Series 40 5th edition user interface with Feature Pack 1. Except for the newly included Maps application, the interface has undergone no notable changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default screen of Nokia 6600 fold features the selected wallpaper with the usual status readings, such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time in the top bar. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the descriptions of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. Fonts on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If needed, active standby mode can be activated. It consists of four parts that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. In the default case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions denoted by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player. At the very bottom the calendar events appear for the current day. A cool feature is the possibility to add a custom note to the active standby screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Main menu icons themselves haven't been changed at all, keeping the well known stylish design with animation of the selected icon. They can also be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original alignment inconvenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you keep an icon selected for a short while, you will even see a tool tip describing the functionality of the sub-menu in small font, so you won't need to step further into another menu level. Strange enough, alphanumeric keyboard shortcuts to menu items are not available with the 6600 fold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six preset ringing profiles on Nokia 6600 fold. These should be enough to cover virtually any scenario. There's an added Flight mode, which turns all transceivers off where the use of mobile phones is not allowed. It can be very helpful for using the phone as an MP3 player aboard a plane for example. The best part is that, unlike some of the competing brands, flight mode can be used without a SIM card inserted, which we find really convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a voice aid application which can help you navigate the menus relying on hearing only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu navigation of Nokia 6600 fold is quick, with no lagging or holdups. There were also no traces of system instability such as freezes or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside of the S40 user interface seems to be the lack of multi-tasking support - something that Sony Ericsson have implemented on their feature phones long ago. With S40 you can't just minimize a Java application (such as the Opera browser for example) and go read a new message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Sony Ericsson phones you can even switch between two running Java applications - (Skype and Google maps are some nice examples here). Nokia isn't there yet with S40, so we guess that puts us on the waiting list for the 6th edition of the interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Customization options are decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are as many as four different view modes available for the main menu of Nokia 6600 fold: a grid of icons with or without labels, a list of items, and tabs. Our personal favorite remains the classical grid of 3 x 3 icons with legends. If you prefer more icons to appear on screen, you can go for the grid view without labels, as it displays a 4 x 3 icon grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background color of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper, can also be easily modified by changing the active theme. There are four themes preinstalled on the Nokia 6600 fold and downloading new ones is no problem at all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Nokia 6600 fold stores up to 2000 contacts. Entries are ordered by first or last name and, quite naturally, you can find a contact by gradually typing the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contact list: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. The phonebook can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. Personal ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign a picture or a video that will run on an incoming call. Bear in mind that the caller image is different for incoming and outgoing calls. It fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears much smaller when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can also be modified, should this be necessary, and it's an option that will surely be widely appreciated. And lastly, contact grouping is also available. This means that contacts can be organized in groups to use as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is voice dial: no pre-recording of contact labels is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 6600 fold hasn't undergone any significant changes either compared to other S40 devices. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as in bulk. Every tab can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and call clarity are on a high level with the Nokia 6600 fold, so you won't have much trouble communicating with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 slide is among the many S40 Nokia phones to feature an active noise cancellation technology for suppressing background noise in calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's about time though Nokia introduced some sort of smart dialing in their feature phones, as most competing manufacturers have already done. It's quite convenient and might save the extra clicks to get to the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 6600 fold is a rather under-par performer. Missing a call in noisier environments is likely, unless you hold the phone right next to your ear. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email. The good menu structure and straightforward handling are commendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Texts and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do to turn a regular SMS into MMS is insert some kind of multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. The T9 dictionary and the handy delivery reports go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will break down into displayed on the screen. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold also comes with the dedicated audio message editor. Thanks to it creating an audio MMS is much faster and easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also doing pretty well. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The handset sports the ultra easy email setup. All you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email-on-the-go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a message is to be sent, it looks up the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Either message headers only or entire messages can be downloaded by default, depending on your choice.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of Nokia 6600 fold is pretty much what we are used to seeing in Nokia feature phones. It has very decent looks and nice all-round functionality, including a good number of supported formats and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with MP3, MIDI, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing listening on wireless Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has an extra skin on top of the default one we got to know since Nokia 5300 XpressMusic. It comes in purple, which perfectly blends with the rest of the phone and looks quite well actually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't like the headset that ships with the phone, you can easily replace it thanks to the 3.5mm standard jack that is to be found on the remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the player, we have to say it offers a large number of configurable options. The sonic experience gets enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. There are 4 equalizer presets on Nokia 6600 fold plus two user slots that can be modified as they wished.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio: RDS included<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold comes complete with a stereo FM radio. It uses the audio player interface and has the well known functions. The proprietary Visual radio client uses data connection to enhance the radio experience by adding graphics and visuals to the audio content broadcast by Visual Radio compatible stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the music player, the FM radio also has two different skins to pick from. RDS is also supported so the package seems complete.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 6600 fold is compatible with the 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen mode also has a positive impact on the viewing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Nokia 6600 fold is decent, save for the really high IMD+noise reading. The phone now has commendable noise and dynamic range levels and the frequency response has also been improved from what we have seen in previous Nokia handsets. Here go the results so you can see for yourselves if Nokia 6600 fold is good enough for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is disappointing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have been keeping track, you'd know that we aren't really in love with the looks of the S40 gallery. The fact that it is an inherent part of the file manager is probably the main cause of disappointment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest (especially for larger pictures) and only goes a short distance, so it is practically of no use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures can be also viewed fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter offers a number of options, but we doubt it Nokia 6600 fold users are likely to consider photo editing on the handset seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final touches to the gallery are the available Slideshow and Search option, the latter being quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Below par 2 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While we're at it, let's have a look at the imaging capabilities of Nokia 6600 fold. The handset packs a 2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. Fixed focus is sure to doom any attempts at close-ups but the LED flash gives some hope of producing a usable picture in the dark now and then. The flash is still rather weak, usable with close range objects only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available camera settings are rather limited but this is understandable given the low-end shooter. The available settings include white balance, three quality levels going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated camera button is the real downer when it comes to operating the camera. Using the confirm button of the D-pad, especially when shooting in landscape mode, is definitely not our preferred handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is poor. Colors are rather precise but pictures lack detail even in very favorable lighting. The main problem is the extremely aggressive noise-reduction gives photos a distinct oil-painted look. In addition the obviously low quality lens reduces the amount of detail even further towards the corners. Given the absence of autofocus, you'd rather not take a picture of a closely situated object or text, as they will surely be blurred. The positive thing we can say about the camera is that the photos look great on the vivid OLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we feel a warning is due about camera speed. This one is surely on the slower side of phones we have managed to test. It will take about 4-5 seconds to save a picture at the highest (2MP) resolution setting and that stretches the shot-to-shot time beyond tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, Nokia 6600 fold manages the sweet VGA resolution but only at 15 fps. The resolution is perfectly OK for hand-held use but the frame rate takes away a great deal of the pleasure. The videos are recorded in 3GP format and their length is only limited by the memory available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video(3.9MB) for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, the imaging capabilities of Nokia 6600 fold aren't what you would expect in a phone in this price range. Looks definitely come first and that's that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: 3G on top<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 fold connectivity options are quite adequate for a feature phone. The seamless USB connectivity leads the lot. Once the USB cable is plugged, you're prompted to select the connection mode. You can then switch between modes with only a few key presses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory card to be directly accessed from a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As mentioned, the A2DP profile is supported to allow a stereo wireless connection. The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - luckily Nokia 6600 fold supports 3G for fast data transfers, as well as EDGE and GPRS for areas where 3G support is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the memory card slot can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring data. Its usability is however undermined by the lack of hot-swap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers included<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold has an integrated HTML browser. No significant changes in functionality have been made to the S40 browser since the 3rd edition of the user interface. Therefore you shouldn't be surprised that it is lacking a lot of the skills of the more advanced alternatives. It still offers decent page rendering and font size customization. When set at the smallest font, up to 11 text lines fit on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the Nokia 6600 fold provides an alternative. The Opera Mini is located in the application section and is really the better browsing choice on the 6600 fold. It is far more intuitive and renders text much better than the integrated browser. Overall, browsing on Nokia 6600 fold can hardly be compared to the best on the market but it still is a decent performer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer's good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of Nokia 6600 fold offers a large number of time management applications with handy features and user-friendly interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar is well-known, offering month, week, and day view modes and six types of events available for setting up. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. The event types are: reminder, meeting, call, birthday, anniversary and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields and some of them even allow an alarm to be set up as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handy To-Do manager enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. Those can also be easily synchronized with the calendar application. Text notes of up to 3000 characters are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish. Unluckily, there is only a single slot so setting up multiple alarms is only available in the calendar. This is another thing we hope gets addressed in future S40 versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, stopwatch and a countdown timer. Finally, the Nokia 6600 fold calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. A loan calculator is also available. Those apps are pretty self-explanatory, so a few screenshots should do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of applications on-board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a good amount of preinstalled stuff on Nokia 6600 fold outside the organizer too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WidSets is a package that provides easy access to a number of web based applications, including weather and an online dictionary, to name a few. A unit converter is also on board and is in fact a really good one. It offers a good number of conversions, including currencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The download application takes you to the Nokia download center. There you are going to find a lot of useful stuff for your handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Presenter is an application allowing you to wirelessly control PowerPoint presentations and a few other Windows applications</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YahooGo application grants instant access to the most popular services offered by Yahoo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing missing here really is the office document viewer that can be found on every midrange Samsung and LG handset nowadays.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Say hello to Nokia Maps for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Maps application has finally arrived on the S40 platform and the Nokia 6600 fold one of the first handsets to feature it. Among the things you can do without a GPS receiver is browse maps, look up addresses and locations, and plan routes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps offers straightforward route planning. Having entered a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting down some Landmarks while you're on the go, or saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. Favorites contents can also be exported/sent via MMS, should you need to do so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having Nokia Maps on your mobile phone is a nice advantage. Of course you can always get the competing Java-based Google Maps but Nokia Maps has one crucial advantage - you can preload your maps on the memory card so that you don't need to download them on-the-go over the air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pair Nokia Maps with an external Bluetooth GPS receiver you can also enjoy real time voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation. It comes at a certain price, but it's always there as an option for those who need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't have an external GPS unit, in some cases Google Maps may be the better choice. For one, it starts much more quickly (Nokia Maps takes quite a while to load on the 6600 fold), and then there's the convenient Locate Me feature that approximates your location based on the map based on cellular base station triangulation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Six nice games are preinstalled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably appreciate the preinstalled content on Nokia 6600 fold including six games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Classic board game fans will be glad to find Backgammon II. It is a nice Java interpretation of the popular game. Snake is essential to Nokia phones, its presence in Nokia 6600 fold hardly a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The High roller casino includes some of the most popular games, such as Texas Hold'em Poker and Blackjack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next two games in line are the sport simulation Golf Tour and the Java version of the popular Japanese game Sudoku. All the games have decent graphics and are comparatively easy to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final game is the Rally 3D. It has decent graphics and can be quite amusing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 fold surely is a neat little phone with distinct personality. The shortish spec sheet won't get you too excited but what's there gets delivered right, except maybe for the camera. But let's not get into that. Performance in geek's terms has nothing to do with performance as in owning the stage. Nokia 6600 fold is the kind of thing to handle with loving care and nonchalantly get people to notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all fairness, we can't help the thought it may be well overpriced. The OLED screen is the only thing that can possibly justify the price tag. We mean, the only thing beside the extra sweet exterior. Plus, cost may as well be irrelevant if you're looking at things from a different perspective. Where the cute Nokia flip seems the perfect fit for chick lit, shoe shop, chit chat.</paragraph>
