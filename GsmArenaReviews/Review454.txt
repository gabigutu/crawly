			<paragraph>We have tested the so eagerly waited walkman from Sony Ericsson. This orange jewel has a memory card of 512 MB capacity, excellent earphones as well as a camera and function menu that are as brilliant as those of Sony Ericsson K750.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>"Hurrah, it is finally here"... one could exclaim. Well, if you take a look at the Asian markets you will find out that Sony Ericsson W800 has been sold there for some time already. Now, however, we have K750's orange brother in our office. It is stunningly stylish and much richer in terms of music options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Official pictures of Sony Ericsson W800</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that its price is not expected to hit crazy heights. The price recommended by the manufacturer is 470 euros, but it's already being offered by some internet shops at a lower price. We expect it to go further down with time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W800 has been designed for customers, who long for style as well as for those who adore music, quality and functionality. You may accuse us of offering you another much too positive review. But please, tell us what we are supposed to do since the famous Swedish-Japanese manufacturer sends us one imposing phone after another.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Oh, this is beautiful...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>... exclaimed an older madam in the train compartment when she saw W800 lying on the small folding table. I was really astonished to hear such an evaluation from a lady of her age. What I have got used to, however, are younger people's curious eyes. Sony Ericsson is do launching one if the best mobile phones ever. Even though W800's designers apparently left their imagination play, they kept its brightening elegance untouched. It still looks solid and somehow "hi-tech".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson W800 compared to a credit card </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combination of creamy white and metal orange do attracts the sight of everyone around. Additional components are glossy silver. W800 could hardly be mistaken with K750, especially when looked at from behind. It is just utterly different. This phones proofs successfully, that ergonomics does not necessary mean hundreds of curves. It is easy to hold in spite of its classic construction. The size has been left unchanged: the device is 100 × 46 × 20 mm big and weighs 99 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The phone does not lie evenly due to its bulgy back part </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new approach has been applied on the keypad and the joystick. Buttons do not share sides and are therefore much easier to recognize than the ones of the less successful keypad of K750. Although they feature low uplift, writing is very comfortable and fast. Press is sure. Joystick is equipped with an orange rubber cap, which co-works perfectly with the middle part of the thumb. In this sense, you can rely on stable and sure control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Joystick is equipped with a rubber cap, due to which it allows perfect control </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the main control buttons are made of plastics, one would never say so. They look as if made of metal. The button for quick access to Activity menu you know from Sony Ericsson K750 has been replaced by a key which activates the MP3 player. Fortunately, the cheap-look notes symbol that was seen in the official pictures of W800 has been replaced by the Sony Walkman logo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Are you crazy about design?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The frame around the cover glass of the display is underlain with silver dots. The glass touches its margins, going as far as the context keys. In the dark the display is lighted with orange glare, which fades in the margins. In such a moment any artist's heart would rejoice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad backlighting is orange ? display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am turning the phone face down. Why? The thing is that you won't find any carved lens cover on the back side of W800. In this phone the camera is hidden behind a tiny round window, which moves really promptly, just in the way one would expect from such a first-rate camera. Oh, yes, I know, phone is not a camera... But just have a look - the new Sony Ericsson model does not resemble a phone from behind at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   W800 resembles a classic digital camera from behind </paragraph>
			<paragraph>W800 is equipped with two lighting diodes. They can be used as a lamp too. It is possible to activate them either during the photographic process, or directly from the menu. The diodes can illuminate either constantly, or for a period of one minute only. They can also send out an SOS signal. The intensity of the diodes is impressive. At night, for example, they manage to throw light on an entire room. In the bottom part of the circle there is an unsecured cut-out for both the ringing speaker and the loud handsfree. W800's sound performance does not become worse even if you place it on a table - this is possible due to the design of the back cover, which stands out a bit in the area of the small circle. In a result, the speaker does not get "suffocated" by the table's surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Light diodes are extremely strong</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>So fine...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What a pity the delivery box does not contain a polishing clout for the display. Fingerprints are visible everywhere. At the same time, I am afraid that the display is very likely to get easily scratched for it is not imbedded. Having in mind, however, that it is style that runs the whole idea about W800, we could probably excuse this inconvenience. The truth is that this big glossy surface levelled with the rest of the phone's body is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is fine. Resolution is nothing special, nor is the size of the active TFT. These two details, however, create a fascinating picture of 176 × 220 pixels on a surface of 10.5 sq. cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphic design has undergone certain modifications, most of which are cosmetic only. The multimedia files icon in the right column has been replaced by the logotype of Sony Walkman. As usual, the phone has four preinstalled themes including a light and an inverse one. For more, connect to internet and download the ones you like. But to my opinion, the originally preset orange theme suits the phone the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Intro display ? animated wallpaper ? orange scheme</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Animated wallpaper can also be used as background. All movements within the display are fully fluent and very fast. The menu pulses, comes out from aside, expands from the middle towards the margins... In his review of Sony Ericsson K750 Marek Lutonský mentioned that he had grown tired with animation in time. In the case of Sony Ericsson W800, however, graphic show has not stopped to amuse me, even though I have been using the phone for several days already. Well, various people, various ideals. In any case, the group of pleased customers would have been bigger if the phone allowed deactivation of the animation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The orange strip<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's now have a look at the strip surrounding the phone, which looks as if made of metal. In its bottom part is the Fast Port connector together with the tiny slot of the microphone. On its right side is the silver camera release button, covered with fingerprints almost constantly. It offers two positions - when half-pressed the camera pre-focuses and when fully pressed the camera takes the picture. Also, at any time, if you press and hold it for while, the camera gets activated automatically. If you open the lens cover, again, the camera starts to run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> System connector Fast Port ? camera shutter release button </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Volume control button has been left in the same place - just by the "head" of the phone. The only difference from previous models is that this time it is situated on phone's right side. In the front upper part of W800 you will find the plate of the infrared port, a holder slot as well as the main switch-off button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Volume control button ? main switch-off button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The play/pause button is situated on the left side of the device. It activates or stops either the MP3 player, or the radio. It can be set to always activate the application that has been last used. Phone's left side, however, is dominated by the cover of the memory card slot. To take out the 512 MB memory card labelled as Memory Stick Pro Duo you need to open the cover and press on the tiny plate inside with the tip of your finger. On one hand the memory card is a proof of the unusual quality of this mobile phone. On the other hand, however, it is basically a necessity since W800 has the functions of a classic walkman. It is possible to pull out the card when the phone is on. If you like, you can get yourself an additional card of maximum 2 GB capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Play/pause button ? Sony Walkman logo ? rubber cover ? memory card </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us now have a close look at the battery. To my disappointment, its characteristics turned to be quite similar to the ones of K750. The music player drags the durability of the phone down to less than two days. At the same time, the officially published durability is 400 hours on stand-by or 540 minutes of phone calls. But if you use your mobile actively, you'd do better if you count with half these numbers at most. Yet, it has been only a while since we started testing W800, so it is still too early for us to provide you with final evaluation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Back cover of the battery ? SIM card slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you insert the SIM card, a mere quarter of the back cover gets removed. Battery is easy to both extract and insert. The SIM card, however, has been designed to require a bit more effort. This way the solidness of the body construction of the phone is kept. The latter is perfect, by the way. No matter how firmly you hold W800, it does not give a single creak.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sharp and true colors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The photos you see in this review are taken with the best mobile phone camera in the history of mobile devices. Not even has Carl Zeiss in Nokia N90 (look at the comparison here) managed to convince me of the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you remove the lens cover or press and hold the release button, the photo mode gets activated. You need to hold the phone horizontally, just like you would do it with a common digital camera. When pressed the phone needs two to three seconds to focus the scene. According to our comparing method, this characteristic sends Sony Ericsson W800 to a worse position, behind the competitors. On the other hand, the effort is worth making. The phone takes excellent pictures. What's more, its macro mode gives brilliant results too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Pictures taken in macro mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are taken in three different resolution schemes: 160 × 120, 640 × 480 and 1632 × 1224 pixels. They are saved in JPEG format. The camera is also able to shoot video with sound in a 176 × 144 resolution and 3GP format. The maximum record length is only limited by the free space in the memory card. You can use the zoom during the shooting process. The camera is equipped with 4x digital zoom allowing for up to 30 zooming steps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera environment</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera offers plenty of settings. Beside standard pictures you can scan panorama landscapes or a sequence of four scenes changing quickly one after another. The focus signal and the release sound are not possible to deactivate directly from the camera menu. To mute them you will have to activate the silent mode (it might not work for all firmware versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, the menu allows you to set the size of the pictures; it also offers two quality grades, a flash diode option, a macro mode, a night mode, self-timer, several graphic effects, white color balance, date and time records. In addition, it asks, whether you prefer the pictures to be saved on a Memory Stick, or in phone's memory. A bit annoying is the fact that the camera menu closes every time a setting has been applied. By moving the joystick sideways you control the exposure compensation. To zoom in or out the picture you are scanning use the sliding volume button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing pictures in the camera </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the fact that W800's camera is identical to the K750's one, I took several new photos, including some photos in macro mode. They all have 300 to 600 kB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Viewing pictures in full resolution</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Musli box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's style and experience in the business with music players are present everywhere in W800. To start, just have a look at the delivery box. It is round, made of plastic, with orange and comfortably bedding cap. It is only up to you to decide what you are going to use it for once the phone has been taken out of it - for musli, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Is there any other phone you can get in such a nice box? </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The disc including PC Suite also carries the Disc2Phone program, which supports recording of music files. This program reads music CDs, creates MP3 files and copies them into the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, eventually I ended up using the classic Windows file manager when I needed to transfer music. Unfortunately, Sony Ericsson W800 does not support Mass Storage. The thing is that the system needs to download a small driver from the installing disc in order to ensure that phone and computer exchange data successfully. Once you have done this you simply need to plug a cable into the USB port. The memory card is mounted as a new drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It contains all kinds of media files - pictures, ringing melodies, MP3 files. The latter are sorted into a special folder. Be careful though. If you save MP3 files directly into this folder, the phone will not be able to manage them and will ask you to use Disc2Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Data cable USB ? memory card reduction</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there is a way to evade Disc2Phone. Just navigate to this location - MSSEMC\Media_files\audio, each subfolder here will be the name of the artist; the albums are stored as subfolders of the artist's folder. In these locations you can save all your MP3 files. It is easy. It is fast. To fasten the process even more, use a memory card reader. 1 MB of data gets downloaded into the phone in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. In other words, you need 4 minutes to store a 70 MB album onto the Memory Stick.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Phone's main lure is its MP3 player. It gets started either through the relevant icon in the menu, or by a press on the button right above the joystick. In fact, you do not even need to switch on the phone to enjoy the advantages of the player, because every time you turn on the phone, you are asked, whether it is only the walkman you are going to use, or the entire phone. Fortunately, it is possible to eliminate this step completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Options after the phone has been started ? new icon Sony Walkman ? player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player manages MP3 and AAC formats. It sorts music by performer's name and then by file's title. Filled ID3 tags are not necessary. On one side this is a certain disadvantage for when you play a song, whose ID3 tag is not filled, neither the performer's name, nor the title of the song gets displayed. But on the other side, it is a plus as the phone does not necessarily needs an ID3tag to work with MP3 files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folder called Music contains all records on a pile. I did not come to use this section at all. Instead, W800 could have rather offered a folder entitled as Albums, which would have not depended on performers. The next item in the menu is Playlists. It allows creating an unlimited number of playlists, in which you can select artists and their entire albums, or gradually add individual songs. Playlists are very easy and quick to create. They are automatically saved. You just have to entitle them. Additional modifications are also permitted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sorting by artists ? songs in the album ? creating a playlist</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playing process alone can be controlled with the joystick. Moving it to the right or to the left you quickly move to the previous or to the following songs. By holding the joystick for while in one of these directions you move within the relevant music file. The process of "rewinding" is noiseless. If you deflect the joystick upwards or downwards, the screen of the display opens as if it was a curtain and a list of all played music files appears. Feel free to browse through them - the song that is being played will not be interrupted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>W800's player can be comfortably controlled even when the keypad is locked as both the volume button and the play/stop button continue to work. The former one, placed on the right side of the phone, controls the volume level. If you press and hold the plus or the minus button (for about a second) the previous or the following file starts to play. The play/stop button on the left side of the phone stops the playing process or switches off the player. By pressing it once again you activate the player again and the song that was being played continues from the moment where it was stopped. All that happens, no matter which part of the menu is being used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though I kept wearing Sony Ericsson W800 in the back pocket of my trousers, I did not have a single problem with the music player. Blindfold, I would easily find the button I was looking for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Some details that have not been given a finishing touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If the last thing you were listening to was your playlist, the current song is played from the beginning, not from the moment, in which it was interrupted. At the same time, when music files are sorted and played by performer or album title, the phone manages to restart playing from the moment, when the file was stopped. Unfortunately, I could not find out the reason for this inconvenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are using another application together with the player, the title of the current song as well as the name of its performer runs in a grey line in the upper part of the display. What I do not understand is why the text that appears on the MP3 player's main display has not been designed to run too. It does not move at all. If the song's title is a bit longer, you just have no luck, because you will not be able to read it at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Rolling text ? in the music player it stays still, unfortunately</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Replacing or moving files are not allowed. Songs can only be sorted by performer's name, file's name or in the order, in which they were added into the playlist. Playlist repeating and shuffling is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a 5 band equalizer. You can choose among several setting modes - straight equalizing curve, bass accentuation, extreme bass accentuation (Mega Bass), equalizer for speech reproduction, and an independent heights accentuation. In all these cases, except for the Mega Bass, the relevant curve can be set manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Let's Rock'n'Roll<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Listening to music through the earphones does not exclude simultaneous usage of other applications. Even if you run more than one functions at the same time, the speed of the menu remains exceptional. The other stunning moment comes when you put the earphones into your ears. The longer you leave them there, the more contented you will be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones need to be plugged into the Fast Port connector. If you let you hand slide down the supplying wire, it will run into a tiny clip, which allows the cable to be fixed onto user's clothes. The clip can be moved all along the cable or removed fully. Right behind it you will find a classic 3.5 mm jack connector. Due to it you have the chance to use your own earphones as well. If you do so, you need to be very careful with the supplying cable for the distance between the phone and the slot of the connector is not short at all. Moreover, make sure you have also counted the length of the supplying cable of your earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Earphones ? have special extension ? a standard jack </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original "plugs" are equipped with long wires so that one can place them around their neck. As usually, Sony Ericsson is very particular about details - on the cable you will find a mouldable sleeve with the manufacturer's logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Plugging into Fast Port ? one can use their own earphones as well </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones are equipped with soft rubber extensions, which you can insert deep into your ears. Similar to Koss The Plug, for example, they pad the sound supply and then use it as a sound media. The resulting reproduction is first-rate. Bass elements are perfect. In terms of quality they are comparable to Koss Sporta Pro. A bit worse (yet still quite good) is the band of the medium and the high frequency, where standard open earphones do better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's make the city hush<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson's earphones remind me of 2+1 speaker sets for PC. I mean the better quality ones, like Logitech Z-3 or Hercules XPS 2.100, whose bass elements are perfect and soft, higher medium ones are somewhat unstable and to enjoy the sound of the guitars, for example, you need to buy another, better speaker set. All this is present in the performance of W800's earphones. Anyway, these are the best earphones you can get attached to a MP3 player in a delivery box, not to mention the fact that here they are basically delivered together with a mobile phone. They are not the type of earphones you would immediately replace. Just on the contrary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are rubber extensions of three different sizes in the box </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the sealing you will be able to comfortably listen to your favourite music both at home and in a crowded street. Walking the city streets with earphones plugged in your ears you will probably feel as if the whole world has activated its "mute" mode. It is almost impossible to hear a passing-by car. The plus is that the noise that surrounds you cannot affect the MP3 sound. On the other hand, it brings along huge risks for without your ears your main defensive reactions are basically reduced to zero. And this is dangerous indeed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio and RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you go tired of your own music, you can turn on the radio. To start it, just plug in the earphones. Then you can play it through the loud speaker as well. The radio is stereophonic; the sound is very stable. Of course, it depends on the position of the supplying wire that serves as an antennae and leads to the earphones. But generally, stations are very easy to find.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio uses RDS. It displays the name of the current station or even additional information, provided it is being broadcasted - like performers' names or songs' titles. The radio offers 20 saving positions for stations in the frequency scale of 87.5 up to 108.0 MHz. You can either search yourself, or leave the automatic mode to do so. The latter works perfectly. It finds the station with the strongest broadcast almost immediately and saves it into the memory at your will. Within the memory however, you need to manually enter the names of the saved stations. The phone does not assign them automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Radio ? station titles have to be assigned additionally</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Sony Ericsson K750 we were complaining about strange clunky sounds coming out every second or so while the radio broadcasts. In W800 they have been eliminated. Its radio tunes automatically when you travel and you pass different broadcasting frequencies. Sound is more or less satisfactory, thanks to the quality of the earphones, mainly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Making calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W800 offers a traditionally high-rate call sound, even though a little bit wider volume scale could have come in handy too. The sound becomes even better if you plug in the earphones - something you will need to do almost all the time, anyway. Do not forget that W800 is a real walkman. The connector situated in the middle pat of the cable serves as a base for the microphone of the handsfree set. The button situated on the connector is to be used when you need to accept or deny an incoming call. Sound is brilliant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a ringing sound the phone offers files in MID, AMR or MP3 format. Surprisingly, files' sound is much better when they are played in the player than when they are used as ringing sounds for incoming calls. In the latter case they are much too high and thus quite unpleasant. Sony Ericsson W800 rings very loudly. In no case shall you miss an incoming call, no matter where the phone is hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing is easy to hear while the phone is playing music as well. The mobile handsfree profile gets activated automatically once the earphones have been connected. Incoming calls stop the music player. In the earphones you will hear the ringing sound that has been installed. To accept a call, press the button mounted in the middle of the cable. The message system works on the same principal. You will easily recognize new messages by their specific melody or tone. Once the ringing has stopped or the message tone has been muted, the player continues its function from the moment where it stopped.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For some users a phone book of 500 names capacity is insufficient. I would like to believe though that for most of you they will be enough. Anyhow, W800's phonebook is better than the ones of its forerunners. When you search through the contacts, the only detail that gets displayed is the outcoming number. To search for more tags, use the right and left arrows. Email addresses appear almost immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching numbers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every name can be assigned 5 types of phone numbers, each of which can appear only once. In addition, each number type can be assigned a specific voice dialling. The other tags are: user's ID for Instant Messaging, web address, picture, one's own ringing, title, company's name, street, city, region, post code, country, note, and birthday. When you enter birthday details, the phone asks you, whether you would like it to save them into the calendar too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Number of tags available within each contact is abundant indeed </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you decide to synchronize, you are given two options to choose between: whether the phonebook should display as first person's first name or their last name. All names can be sorted into groups. The phonebook, however, does not allow that each group is given a specific picture or ringing tone, these settings are assigned on per contact basis. Calls are filtered on a group base.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Work with messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>W800 works with SMS, EMS and MMS as well as emails and instant messages. It offers a bare sound MMS recording as well. T9 dictionary is possible deactivate for good. But if you decide to use it, it will make writing easier. It offers the words you use most often as first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Creating SMS ? there are four lines available ? incoming message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Font is large, but not utterly black. The black nuance used here is somewhat brighter than the common one. At the same time it is bold and very easy to read. The W800's font is far much better than the thin letters used in older Sony Ericsson models. Writing is quite fast. The phone reacts immediately. The speed of writing does not fall even when a message of 20 sections is being created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editor alerts you of the end of each section when you come to write its final characters. It does not count from the beginning of the message. When you try to send it, a list of people from the phonebook, whom you have recently sent messages, appears on the display. To send the message simply select the contact you need. The MMS editor is well organized too. A MMS can contain a maximum of 300 kB. Pictures, sounds or videos can also be attached to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The same calendar and alarm clock<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W800's calendar is very logic. Use the keys on the keypad to search into different years, months and weeks. The calendar offers month, week and day views. However, it has only one type of events for all records. Each event can be assigned an alert for particular time, but the phone does not allow their repetition. The latter becomes possible after synchronization with the computer has been initiated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Month ? week ? and day view at the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock can repeat on selected days. Its alarm plays even if the phone is off. The phone is able to wake you up using a classical bell ringing mode, radio broadcasting signal, or a favourite music piece of your own you have saved into the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, phone's organizer offers tasks and a check off option. All functions are simple to execute - notes, stopwatch or countdown. In the menu you will also find a calculator as well as code memory protected by a four-character access password and a control word. W800 lacks measurement converter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Task editor</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The fastest games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>JBenchmark testing applications run on W800's display as fast as a lightening. The orange Sony Ericsson did as best as its forerunner K750, which makes these two mobiles the fastest classical phones in terms of graphics on the current mobile market. Here are the results of W800:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fun section offers two java games. The first one is called PuzzleSlider. It breaks down a selected picture, or even a photo, into 9 to 36 squares, which you then have to then put together. The second game is QuadraPop. It is a standard Tetris, featuring colorful notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  PuzzleSlider ? QuadraPop ? setting the size of the application window</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Fun folder also contains HID profiles. They help you manage Media Player or other computer programs through Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HID profiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VideoDJ is an internal application for video modification and montage. PhotoDJ is another application that allows you to modify photos with the help of several different tools. MusicDJ works with music samples, with which you can compose your own music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  VideoDJ ? PhotoDJ ? MusicDJ</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W800 features a dictaphone, which can be used alone or as a background for a running call. The opposite side knows it is being recorded thanks to a peep sound that comes out every 20 seconds. When activated in a standard way, the dictaphone starts recording promptly. The record length is limited by the free space on the memory card only. Sound is ordinary and is usually saved in an AMR format. Although the dictaphone is nothing special, it is quite a helpful tool for making notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dictaphone is much too simplified </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data flows<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W800 suffers from the same nuisance K750 was rebuked for - it does not have EDGE. This disadvantage may disappoint some customers. Others will not even happen to think about it. Anyway, the absence of EDGE is probably the only defect this new mobile beauty could be blamed for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you need to get connected to the net, you will need to manage with CSD and HSCSD, or GPRS Class 10. I did several tests with GPRS through a data cable. Thanks to the guide of the Mobile Networking Wizard program setting proceeded fluently. Connection was good. It was announced as 115 kb/s, but the real transferring speed was about 40 kb/s. There is no doubt that if the phone had been equipped with EDGE technology, my contented smile would have shined even brighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Data USB cable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Communication programs are fully identical to those of K750's PC Suite. So let me, please, insert here an extract from Marek's review of Sony Ericsson K750: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>File Manager: provides access both to the phone's memory and the memory card. The memory card is also accessible directly from any common file manager, which is basically the only available option if the phone is connected through a cable. In a cable connection the File Manager displays the capacity of the inner memory only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image Editor: an application for work with pictures - it helps create wallpaper on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS Home Studio: designed to help you create a master form for your MMS. The multimedia messages are saved into the phone and then sent to the addressee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sync Station: a program, which synchronizes data with the computer, i.e. with Microsoft Outlook or the address book in Windows. The first synchronization I started was not only quite slow, but also led to an error in the middle of the process. Synchronizing became much faster as soon as the phone was loaded with data and only information alternations had to be transferred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile Networking Wizard: its purpose is to quickly set up data connections. Even if my first impression was that the Wizard was not able to detect the network correctly, in the end everything worked properly, even in a standard setting. I just had to ignore the options that were being offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All programs are available to download for free in Sony Ericsson's official internet site.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Even better than Sony Ericsson K750!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I dare say this, even if this should mean the start of a passionate discussion. In my opinion, any comparison between K750 and W800 speaks in favour of the latter. The new Sony Ericsson model costs about 100 euros more, which is not that much if you take into account the fact that it features a MP3 player with 512 MB memory card. Its numerous applications and stylish design are definitely worth the price. If you find it too expensive, simply wait! There is no doubt that its price will soon start to fall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have already decided to buy it though, then be sure that you are going to pay for a first-rate mobile phone equipped with brilliant and fast applications. There is little to miss here. In addition, do not forget that W800 offers the best mobile phone camera on the current market and what is even more important - it features a MP3 player of excellent sound and a broad range of setting options.</paragraph>
