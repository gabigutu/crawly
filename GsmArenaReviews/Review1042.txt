			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What can I help you with? Hope your day is going well. It's a start. But it'll take time for the likes of Siri and Google Now to live up to the Intelligent Personal Assistant title. Surprisingly, intelligent isn't too far off for software that's context and location aware, does speech recognition and has an impressive backend of resources and services. Personal? Well, Google obviously knows who you are, where you are and what you've been up to lately. Yet, we'll stick to calling them virtual for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Assistant then is perhaps the trickiest bit. So it seems. And the question is (barring scenarios where your hands and eyes are busy with something else) whether we really need to do by voice what can be done at the click of a button - ok, a few buttons. And if it's info and content, can we not just Google it instead of having Google Now do it for us?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, things like Google Now and Siri are but a taste of what your smartphone can do for you. There's plenty of potential there and Apple and Google are hopefully looking beyond the launching of apps, personalized and localized search and voice typing. Not least because the hardware race isn't going to go on forever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you are experiencing isn't some sort of a strange deja vu. We had a similar comparison indeed on our blog, but it was well before Google Now and iOS 6 (and the improved version of Siri that came with it). Samsung's S Voice had just launched on the Galaxy S III but, honestly, the experience was less than perfect. It was more of a see-Apple-we-can-do-it-too kind of thing. Google Now has now taken over and is available on every single Android smartphone with Jelly Bean. Not only that, it's very much a part of Google's long-term plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, a few months ago we were less than impressed with the three different pieces of software. Slow to respond, and sometimes blatantly wrong, the virtual personal assistants just weren't up to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, since users aren't best known for lowering their expectations, the software has evolved to offer new and better features. So, we're about to look beyond the big change logs and get some real action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are going to see what new tricks Apple's Siri, Google Now and Speaktoit have learned and how they can be of use in our everyday lives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tasks at hand are going to be as close to real-world scenarios as possible. A weather brief in the morning, pending appointments and other calendar events, the latest news, warning about flights being delayed and checking available seats for our movie of choice for the evening. These are all an essential part of an assistant's resume.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Chances are, you are already familiar with the contenders in this practical test. Apple's Siri, Google Now and the Speaktoit Assitant all have been around for a while, so we'll spare you the awkwardness of first handshakes. However, in order to understand where all of them are coming from and they are after, we'll have a detailed look at each.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple Siri<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Kicking off with Siri, the inner voice of the iDevices. It was introduced as one of the key software goodies in iOS 5, as a result of Apple's acquisition of the eponymous company. It has been refined since, including a substantial redesign to feel more "Apple".</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very beginning (iOS 5) Siri was able to send texts, call contacts, update your Twitter, set reminders for you and even tell you whether it's going to rain or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Later on, Siri also developed an interest in sports, while restaurant and movie reviews came as an extra bonus to the overall experience. Since iOS 6, launching apps is also on the list of skills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple is keen to make a point that Siri doesn't just understand what you say, but knows what you mean, as well. As a result, you can ask it indirect questions and it'll still be able answer it. In most cases it'll succeed, thanks to the large database of case scenarios that's being regularly updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the cases when it doesn't understand what exactly you're on about, it reaches to WolframAlpha for answers to your question. If it's a restaurant recommendation you're after, then Yelp is the back office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing with Siri is that it doesn't need you to speak like a robot in order for it to understand the meaning of the words coming out of your mouth. Asking it if you simply need to take an umbrella with you is enough for Apple's assistant to check the weather, see if it's going to rain in your area and generate a response based on the current information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more to Siri than meets the eye, though. It's got that little bit of personality that you simply do not get with the other virtual personal assistants. For instance, Siri will be more than happy to tell you a joke or answer a cheeky question. As a side effect, making sly comments is also in her nature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's what separates Siri from the rest of the virtual personal assistant pack. Unlike the many alternatives out there, Siri isn't simply a tool that lets you do stuff. Given the chance, it'll try to put a smile on your face, while fulfilling its duties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it'll do so in a number of different languages. Naturally, there's support for English, but also German, Spanish, Japanese, French, Italian, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese. And while the language support is sufficiently wide many of Siri's features only work in the US and Canada.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not to stay too far behind Apple, Google launched its own voice solution in the summer of 2012. Google Now of course takes a slightly different approach. Instead of waiting for you to ask something, Google Now is trying to be proactive and suggests things you might be interested in in the form of cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The card-based user interfaces allows you to quickly scan the stuff that matters to you. Currently, Google Now offers you cards for traffic to and from work or home, a weather forecast, stocks, your favorite sports team's fixtures and even friends' birthdays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a total of 25 different types of cards and Google promises that more are on the way (we suspect details to be unveiled at Google I/O 2013 in May). The more interesting among them such as Restaurant reservations, Packages, Boarding Pass and Flights require you to give Now access to your Gmail, but if you do you won't even have to ask for it to set a reminder for you. Once you get an email confirming your booking it will automatically put it in your schedule.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now even knows approximately where you are (if you allow it to sniff around, of course) and suggests things for you to do. For example, if you're away from home, Google Now will kindly suggest some tourist attractions for you to visit. And it will always keep you updated on the time it will take you to arrive home in the current traffic conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to fully enjoy the power of Google Now, you'll have to grant it access to your Google search history. This way, for example, it'll alert of upcoming events near you (concerts of your favorite band for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Make no mistake about it, Google Now is as tightly integrated in Android 4.1 Jelly Bean as Apple's Siri is in iOS - you can access it from anywhere in the user interface (the access method is different for different OEMs, but rarely involves more than a couple of taps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the microphone button in Google Now allows you to not only place a search query but also boss your phone around. You can set alarms, add calendar events, place phone calls and send text messages or get navigated using Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For trivial search queries like currency and unit conversions, looking for famous people or places and notable events, Google harnesses the power of its Knowledge Graph - a service for gathering information from a wide range of sources to show you what you want to know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voice search feature of Google Now is part of the Google Search app and supports a much wider array of languages (nearly 40) than Siri. The search giant is constantly adding new languages and updating the already existing ones with new features such as dictation and search functionality. However, the cards in Google Now don't support the full range of languages just yet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Speaktoit Assistant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Virtual personal assistants don't come only from big players like Google and Apple. There's a small company called Speaktoit, which offers a full-fledged virtual personal assistant alternative called simply Assistant. It's reminiscent of Siri, in its ways of freely communicating with you and making an effort to ask your question alone, before resorting to initiating a Google search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is very versatile and its rich list of features goes on for miles. You can launch apps, find information on the web, get answers to your questions (what's 2+2 and up), send and read text messages as well as launch apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, our favorite feature just has to be Briefing: you're presented with plenty of information for the current time and date, weather conditions, upcoming events from your calendar and hottest news read to you by the Assistant each morning. In fact, you can choose between a set of male and female voices with either British or American accents for the Assistant to use. Mind you, that's a premium feature and you need to pay $2/month to get a premium account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Speaktoit Assistant, unlike Now and Siri, also lets you redesign its looks. The Assistant's avatar can be customized by choosing gender, clothing, and even tiny details like hair style, type of nose, mouth or eyebrows. You can change the background of the app, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third-party app taps into Google's rich voice search functionality, but only supports English English, German, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese for now. However, it uses the native Android text-to-speech service, which isn't all that great as the speech sounds choppy and doesn't flow as naturally as Siri's for instance. The add-on voice packs from iSpeech (premium) aren't all that great either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bright side, the Assistant is very "open-minded" and can even tell you quite a lot of jokes should you ask it. You can even engage in a proper conversation with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It should be noted that Speaktoit is available for Android, iOS and Windows Phone 7 and up. However, we chose the Android version, since it also gave us the chance to test the Assistant's newly introduced premium features. One of them is the option to teach your assistant how to respond or what to do based on your input; you can also assign nicknames to your friends (instead of saying their full names) and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature of the Assistant is that it doesn't always wait for you to activate it. Sometimes it will push a line to your notification area, suggesting you a quick brain workout or another activity it believes you might like. It is also the only one that can be activated by simply shaking your phone, instead of having to unlock it and press some buttons first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that the app has had a few million downloads and consistently getting positive user feedback is certainly encouraging and we are hoping there's good reason for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, all of the assistants reviewed here aren't without their special needs. For example, the voice search technology requires you to talk with a moderate tempo and articulate clearly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only that, but they tend to hang on to some keywords in the not so rare cases when they don't fully understand what you are telling them. If you say something that remotely sounds like "restaurant" for example, the assistant will automatically assume you are searching for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enough talk though, let's see how Google Now, Siri and Speaktoit go about different tasks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple Siri test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that we got to know our contenders a little better, it's finally time we put them through their paces in some real-life tests. Now we are not going to focus our attention on which one of them does its job best when it comes to its set of skills, but rather which could be most helpful in various real-life situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how it'll go down. We get to put the three virtual personal assistants, through a normal everyday scenarios and see which one manages to be most helpful. Pretty simple, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We started off with a simple morning routine - asking what time it is, what are our tasks for the day and finally, what are the latest news. Then, we moved on to having breakfast and having a little chat with our personal assistants. We asked them about the calories in our meal, how's the traffic to work, and to tell and tell us something interesting while we are having our meal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried how good the three are when it's time to do something fun like watching a movie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What good is a personal assistant if it can't keep track of our favorite sport? In this particular case, it's football and the assistant gets asked about upcoming matches and player details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since it was Apple's Siri that started the whole virtual personal assistant craze, we only found it logical to start with it. Here's the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This question is a piece of cake for Siri.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri was confused on the more obscure question. Rephrasing the question to contain a more obvious keyword got us the answer we wanted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, Siri failed to give us the latest headlines and tell us what's new. Instead, Apple's virtual assistant boasted about the new things it was able to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has taught Siri to look for answers to questions like that through the Wolfram Alpha service, but surprisingly, Siri thought we were going to a restaurant instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No problems for Siri and Apple Maps here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weather forecast was the response we wanted and it was the one we got.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri demonstrated that it's got character with that one. It didn't recommend anything specific, since it hasn't actually seen any movies at all, but it successfully pulled out a list of highly rated films, which is really all that could be expected from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple's virtual assistant continued to wow us by successfully getting a movie review of the The Dark Knight Rises from Rotten Tomatoes. Furthermore, it read the movie's final score for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple Siri gave a straightforward answer although it spared us the additional details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri integrates very well with the iPod functionality of the iPhone and was not only able to play Dream Theater songs but also skip and pause tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After it failed to pull out information about the band, Siri offered us to search for it on the web (its default fallback when information isn't found).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike Google Now and Speaktoit Assistant which all provide general information about past and future Barcelona fixtures, Apple's Siri showed us only the schedule for the team's next match, which exactly what we were after.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri continued to get things right by telling us relevant information for Messi and his football career. It even went as far as showing detailed statistics for his physics and goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Apple is still working on providing Siri with the ability to give directions outside the US.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Showing Google and Apple stocks was no problem for Siri, but understandably it couldn't give us any investor advice. The fact that understood what we asked and gave an adequate response was more than commendable, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flights aren't in Siri's bag of supported features yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri handled making calls and sending text messages effortlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were no problems here for Siri.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri showed its charming character once again and thanked us for our flattering comment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, Siri failed miserably and oddly responded "Search me".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri isn't only well-spoken but has a great sense of humor, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service didn't read the answer out loud, but relied on Wolfram Alpha (not Google) to find the answer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri successfully found the meaning of the word, but sadly didn't bother to read it for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri has top-notch appointment-making skills and didn't experience problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not knowing the answer, Siri suggested to search the web for us here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wrap up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, we were pretty impressed by the amount of answers Siri got right. It was the best of the three in that aspect, but unfortunately it was also the slowest of the three to respond to each of our questions. The slow response time often made us wonder if we wouldn't have finished some of the tasks quicker if we had simply used the touchscreen, rather than our voice. Siri also loses some point for the lack of pro-active behavior - unlike the other two it was never going to help us with anything unless we specifically asked it to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on to Google Now and its performance in our test..</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A simple question, which Google Now answered without hesitation. As an added bonus, it showed us the current location of the device below the clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the main tasks of every personal assistant is to report the upcoming agenda of its employer. Unfortunately, Google Now failed to oblige here, as for now it's calendar-managing abilities end up with creating new appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alas, Google Now couldn't update us on the latest news. It couldn't think of anything interesting to share with us while we were having breakfast, either. Not quite the sociable type, this Now guy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, Google failed to give us information on that, too. To be perfectly honest, we didn't have our work address set up in the first place, but even so, Google Now could have been kind enough to ask us to enter it and then give us the relevant information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the service didn't give us any traffic information with a work address already entered. It seems the only way to know that is by looking at the notifications it automatically creates for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turns out that Google Now could be a bit more flexible and managed to answer this simple question for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where the power of Google's Knowledge Graph kicked in and fed Now with an answer to our question. Ideally, we would have liked a more detailed answer to our question, but regardless, it got the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In spite of fetching and displaying the right answer, the assistant didn't read it aloud. It's not a bad result, but it wouldn't have cost anything to be read to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here Google Now gives you to option to choose the source for playing the music. In our case, that was either YouTube or Play Music. We chose the latter. The good thing is that Now didn't waste any time asking us which song to play and just picked one at random. Some could find it irritating, but we liked the immediate action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It should be noted that we also asked Now to also skip a track and create a playlist of Dream Theater songs, but it failed to fulfill both of these requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like before, Now found the relevant information and displayed it to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After catching a movie and listening to some music, it's time to focus our attention on sports. Could Google be of any help here?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Barcelona is our favorite football team, we asked when they are going to play next. Again, thanks to some Knowledge Graph magic, Google was able to give us the full schedule of the team's upcoming matches and past results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A trick question, which Now couldn't answer. Instead, it placed a Google search for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google searched for Karaoke bars, but didn't point out to any specific one. On our second request to place a call, it picked one at random and suggested we should call it. We aren't sure the reason for picking that bar - positive user reviews, competitive prices or whether it was closest to our location - but whatever it is, at least Google Now tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When explicitly asked for a coffee shop nearby, Google successfully tried to navigate us to one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite being a pretty long walk, Google got us directions to the White House without any trouble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Google Now didn't provide an answer how it's doing on the stock market, it showed us relevant results for its stock pricing. It even showed Apple's stock pricing, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively, the service for tracking flight statuses works like a charm and Google Now handled those questions with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now has been taught the basic personal assistant tasks and it was able to call a contact from the contacts book and also compose a text message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Understandably, Google isn't very fond of neither Twitter nor Facebook, since the search giant sports its own social network dubbed Google+. As you would imagine, it had no problems updating our status on that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are sure that complimenting Google Now made it blush, but it didn't return us any assistant-like response. Instead, it placed a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's all business and no play for Google Now and it's cold assistant heart left us searching for a joke on our own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Math is one of Google's strong sides, so it didn't experience any issues giving an answer to our question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The definition was read out loud, again thanks to Google's Knowledge Graph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now is capable of creating appointments for us, but didn't quite understand what we meant when saying "in two days".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has a lot of information on its servers, but it looks like that prices of gas isn't there just yet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wrap up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now didn't have a particularly high percentage of right answers and chose to resort to googling stuff for us more than the other two contestants. It's not that those Google searches aren't helpful - more often than not what we were looking for was in the first result, but that's not what a proper virtual assistant should do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, Google Now feels more like a voice-powered extension to the company's search engine (which it actually is) that can occasionally read you some of the results. This might not be too bad though, particularly when you consider that it was also the fastest of the three. Besides, the cards it automatically generates are surprisingly useful, so very often you don't even need to launch the actual application to get the needed information.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Speaktoit Assistant test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, it's time to see how the third-party Assistant from Speaktoit handles our test. Check out the video, highlighting the key parts of its performance below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistant didn't experience any problems here, just as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first, Speaktoit Assistant didn't understand what we were asking, as there weren't any real keywords for it to use. In the next question, though, it showed our agenda for the day, since it contained the word 'appointments'.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wittily, our request was met with a list of result from Google News, although the Speaktoit Assistant is capable of much more. The third-party butler sports a feature dubbed "Briefing". which we already mentioned, and we hoped it would kick in, but unfortunately, it didn't. Oh, well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the Assistant couldn't come up with anything interesting to tell us, leaving us to eat in complete silence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, the Assistant tried to get our location via the GPS and for some unknown reason failed to pinpoint it and get us the traffic. We believe it's a glitch in the software, which is going to get fixed soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Answering that question turned out to be hard for the Assistant. On the first attempt it thought we were asking it to add an event to our calendar. On the second one, things were better as it gave a weather forecast. Still, it failed to give a definite yes or no answer to the simple question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the Assistant didn't place a Google search for reviews of said movie, but chose to show us images related to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like Google Now, Speaktoit Assistant gave a short and precise answer with the search being powered by Wolfram Alpha, rather than Google. We liked the fact that the Assistant searched different sources and was flexible enough to provide the best answer it was able to find online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Assistant and Google Now gave the same answer to this question. However, the former read it back for us, while Google Now preferred staying mum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Speaktoit Assistant had no problems playing a song by the band of our choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Falling to its default state of searching Google, the Assistant was able to provide us with the team's schedule. Again, we would've liked it to read us the result in a human-like manner, but it seems it's not ready to do so just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's more like it. Not only did the Assistant found a detailed information about the famous footballer, but it also read it out loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistant admitted it didn't know any fun karaoke bars and suggested to bring a map so that we could choose on our own. When we agreed, however, it suddenly forgot what we were on about and we were left with nothing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asking it to call a karaoke bar didn't lead to the result we were hoping for. The Assistant thought it should look for the bar phone number in our contacts book.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We admit, that's a somewhat obscure question, but nevertheless the Speaktoit Assistant found the parties in our area for the current day. Kudos for that. Take me to the White House on foot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Speaktoit Assistant detects that you want to go places, it automatically opens the Google Navigation app. Unfortunately, it isn't as widely available just yet, but the functionality of the assistance in this area is top notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No problems for the Assistant here, too. It placed a Google search and showed us the relevant results. In one occasion, when it wasn't sure which company's stock we were searching for, it was kind enough to ask us once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more time, the software relied on Google's help to display the result. However, when we asked if the second flight arrived on time, the Speaktoit Assistant was confused and didn't quite understand it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are the regular run-of-the-mill personal assistant requests and Speaktoit Assistant experienced no problems with the tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After acquiring permission to post on our behalf to the popular social networks services, Speaktoit Assistant fulfilled our request.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Who would have known that the Assistant could understand our feeling towards it and respond in a very kind manner. We were thoroughly surprised of its politeness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While its colleagues didn't have any issues getting the local time in New York, the Assistant, rather strangely considering its good performance thus far, didn't manage to get it for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Predictably, the Assistant relied on Google for the math question in our list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaktoit Assistant isn't just polite and kind, it also sports great appointment-making skills, just like a real-life assistant should.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wrap up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The third party Speaktoit Assistant is certainly a formidable rival to the established services. It was second fastest and the second most helpful, but probably the one that was most fun. First because it's the only one to offer customization options, but also because it's pretty good at making us laugh (it knows some killer knock knock jokes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistant was also occasionally suggesting us a brain teaser, telling us random cool facts and asking us to guess whether they are true or false. Finally, we found its briefing feature to be quite a cool way to start your day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, we tested just three voice assistants and there're a few dozens in the Android market alone. And we obviously haven't covered all the smart platforms. These are arguably the biggest names but every OS is developing and refining its own solution. BlackBerry has one and so does Windows Phone, and makers are all making a big deal about them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If nothing else, it's a promise that they will stick around and will only be getting better. And by the latter we don't mean that amazing experiences are around the corner - rather acknowledging the fact that there's quite a lot to improve. Language and market support are still limited, for one, and the voice recognition software isn't up to speed with spoken language (although rapid advancements are made there).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice assistants are still at a stage when they cannot possibly tip the scales in favor of one platform or the other. We don't think they will be able to influence the purchase of a smartphone any time soon. And it's not just due to the fact that one of the contestants is available on all major platforms already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yet, we thought it might be helpful to track progress. There're many iPhone and Android users who have never used Siri or Google Now. Not so much because their language isn't supported but because the whole concept may've seemed alien to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it definitely wasn't our goal to pick a winner. We can say though what we liked about each. To us Siri is the closest to having a personality, Speaktoit is the easiest to teach stuff and Google Now is obviously the best at finding content that's relevant to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of them will take charge of your phone just yet but they can all open apps, convert voice to text, search the web and help you manage your calendar among other things. There's more advanced stuff too like suggesting upcoming events around your location, shipment tracking and navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To a certain point, virtual assistants can be trusted to get things done. It's getting things done in a refined and sophisticated fashion that still eludes them. But wait a minute, are we forgetting something here? It's software after all. Maybe we're too used to being impressed with visuals and features, and want to be equally amazed by quirks, nuances and subtleties typical of human behavior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, a virtual personal assistant to talk to, rather than talk at, is a long, long way down the road. Yet, if growing a sense of humor and irony is a legitimate next step, we must be ready to handle it. It seems there's a fairly easy way to make robots look more human, without being too bright. How about teaching them chatspeak?</paragraph>
