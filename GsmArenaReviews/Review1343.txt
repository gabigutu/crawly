		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung?s QWERTY messengers have not exactly been setting the world on fire. They have done well though to set the scene for this one. The Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 follows on the heels of Omnia and Corby. It puts Android in a time-tested form factor and is ready to entertain upgraders coming from dumbphones and PocketPCs alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro has a clear objective ? deliver the full Android experience, a good social package and hassle-free messaging. What does it need to meet those tasks? Well, a comfortable QWERTY keyboard obviously, possibly a touchscreen, enough processing power and at least some basic shooting skills to capture the important moments. Of course, a messenger is nothing without a proper OS and this is where the Android Froyo comes in. But let?s see what else the Galaxy Pro has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It should be clear by now the Galaxy Pro B7510 isn?t your typical Android powerhouse for HD video, quality imaging or heavy-duty internet browsing. Gaming is out of the picture too. To be honest, the Galaxy Pro doesn?t quite make the grade as a BlackBerry competitor. To make up for it, it is social and friendly ? and a great texter too. Virtual keyboards have been getting better but the Galaxy Pro?s superbly laid-out keypad is the prefect addition to Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 it is and, although this is not the typical Android package, let?s hope the experience is up to scratch. With a handful of Samsung Ch@ts, Corbies and Omnia messengers gone almost unnoticed, we?re about to see if our Galaxy Pro here has what it takes to leave a mark. Our traditional hardware check-up is due right after the break.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tiny retail box of the Galaxy Pro B7510 has room for a microUSB cable and a charger, an SD-to-microSD adapter with 2GB worth of a complimentary card and some leaflets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 108.6 x 66.7 x 10.7 mm, the Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 is reasonably compact considering its four-row QWERTY keyboard and the 2.8? landscape display. There are smaller messengers out there of course but few of them have touchscreen. The Galaxy Pro falls short of the superb comfort of some BlackBerry or Nokia Eseries messengers but is not without its own advantages: perfect keyboard and perfectly manageable weight of 103 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android has never been the platform of choice for dedicated business phones and messengers. It?s been living in the shadow of the Nokia Eseries and BlackBerry ? even Windows Mobile. Occasional messengers by Acer are no more than exceptions that prove the rule. And Motorola ? well ? let?s say they?ve been more creative than businesslike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro is Samsung?s first droid messenger but the company?s background and experience were used well. It?s a well-designed and firmly built phone that handles well. The keyboard is a pleasure to use with those big and perfectly shaped buttons. This is not a phone to make a huge difference and unsettle the leaders in the messenger class, but it?s sure to please the right users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With sober styling and quality finish, the Galaxy Pro looks above its expected price tag. The features are middling but emphasis was obviously put on the design and handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 is pretty standard for the form-factor. The keyboard and the screen above are framed in glossy grey plastic while the back has a textured grey finish successfully imitating metal. The phone is completely made of plastic but that?s by no means a drawback. On the contrary, the low weight certainly helps the handling of a handset that?s wider than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8? TFT display on the Samsung Galaxy Pro has QVGA resolution, which is nothing to be impressed with. Even Nokia have already put a VGA screen on their E6 messenger. The Galaxy Pro uses a capacitive touchscreen which has great response but does not support multi-touch. Viewing angles are limited and sunlight legibility - mediocre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the display are the earpiece and the proximity sensor (to the right). There is neither an ambient light sensor, nor a video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, we find the four typical Android controls: Menu, Home, Back and Search. They are all set within a thin strip of black glossy plastic. The Home and Menu keys share a single rocker-styled button ? well spaced though and perfectly comfortable to use. The Menu key on the left and Search on the right are separate knobs, both very prominent and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four-row QWERTY keyboard is the key feature of the Galaxy Pro. And it?s not a Nokia or BlackBerry rip-off. Samsung has been building on its own messenger designs and the actual handset is wide enough to allow big and well-spaced keys. Overall, the prominent, nicely sculpted and firmly fitting buttons on the Galaxy Pro make up a silky and responsive keyboard, which is a pure joy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Galaxy Pro B7510 hosts the solitary volume rocker while the right one accommodates the Sleep/Power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the phone are the lanyard eyelet, the 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB connectivity port covered with a sliding lid. The mouthpiece is at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, now, Galaxy Pro, turn around! As we said earlier, the back of the smartphone is all plastic but will successfully pass as metal ? as long as you don?t touch it. It has similar texture as the Galaxy S II battery cover, but this one here looks a lot better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is where we find the 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera and the loudspeaker grill. There is no LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover we find the hot-swappable microSD card slot, the SIM bed and the 1350mAh battery. The battery life was short of impressive ? the phone barely made it through two full days of average use ? some calls and emails, a bit of browsing and 30 min. of music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on with the user interface, we have to say Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 managed to impress us with its commendable build quality and materials. The QWERTY keyboard is undoubtedly the key feature and they did well to make it superbly comfortable. The phone feels strong and durable while at the same time is reasonably compact and nice to handle. The QVGA screen is a bit of a letdown but hopefully they won?t be charging a fortune.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface: TouchWiz on Froyo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro B7510 uses Android 2.2 Froyo, topped with the in-house TouchWiz UI. The thing which immediately stands out is the landscape layout of the whole UI. The four docked icons, which normally sit at the bottom of your screen, have migrated over to the right side, leaving the homescreens and menus to use the center of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re interested in seeing how this messenger droid behaves itself, you can check out the video we?ve prepared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro supports up to seven homescreen panes, which can populate every widget and pack of icons you?ll even need. However, if you don?t need all seven of them, the unnecessary ones can be deleted by hitting the edit option in the menu. Doing so makes the Galaxy Pro noticeably snappier. You can add, remove and rearrange the panes as you desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the notification bar down reveals the Android notification area. It is majorly overhauled from the stock Android one and holds five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and rotation-lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button while on the homescreen lets you add variety of content on it (a press and hold on the homescreen does the same thing), add or delete homescreen panes, change the wallpaper or quickly access the settings menu Live wallpapers are supported as well with only one coming preinstalled and many more available in the Market. The contextual menu has shortcuts too for search and notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in the vanilla Android). List view is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange icons freely. Icons are shown in a 4x3 grid with a total of 12 icons per menu screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting change in the Android 2.2-compatible version of Samsung?s TouchWiz launcher is the built-in task manager. Complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently active apps, it saves you the need to install a task killer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It gives the user details on RAM usage, the amount of free storage and can be accessed through virtually any spot in the UI by holding the home button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We decided to complete a couple of benchmarks on the Galaxy Pro. Sadly, we could only procure several and not all of them. Quadrant is missing because of an obvious problem it had with the Galaxy Pro. It would finish the benchmark but not show the full results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro has an ARMv6 800 MHz processor and 270 MB worth of RAM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung Galaxy Pro is plainly said, excellent. It has unlimited capacity and all the functionality you could want. The contacts application displays contacts stored in the SIM card, in your Google account or in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz interface has been at work in the phonebook bringing some special features. Instead of just flick-scrolling the list of people in the phonebook, you can search the entries by either typing the name of the person in the search box or by using the alphabet scroll at the right side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pro also packs the quick contacts feature, which first appeared on Android 2.1. Using a single click, it lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email a contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange. There are many other details that you can assign to each entry, such as numbers, email addresses, IM, organization, and more. Clicking the plus sigh on the right adds another field of that type, while the minus sign deletes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main contact list view hides some useful shortcuts too. Swiping your finger to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer. The side-sweeping shortcuts are part of the TouchWiz UI and work in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy B7510 Pro handled calls great. It held on to signal everywhere we took it and the in-call quality was superb. There were no dropped calls either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works beautifully. Tap a digit and it searches both contact numbers and names for it. If more than one contact is found, there?s a number and an arrow, which show you the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is situated within the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, which can be filtered to show only certain type of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Mini and it scored an overall Good mark. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Droid messenger professional<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a QWERTY messenger droid, the Galaxy Pro features all Android-inherent messaging prowess you?d want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging application itself is quite straightforward. It has a new message button and bellow it are all the received messages organized in threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same swiping functionality found in the phonebook has been integrated here as well. A swipe to the left starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application-specific search lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to a text message automatically turns into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email can be handled either by the standard Gmail app or the generic email app. The Gmail one supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI of the Gmail app is quite easy to use and looks beautiful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email application is used for all your other non-Gmail email accounts and supports multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, text input is covered solely by the hardware QWERTY keyboard on the Galaxy Pro. It doesn?t even feature a virtual one, which come to think about it wouldn?t make sense on such a small QVGA-only touchscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android gallery is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro uses the standard Android gallery, which is great. It offers the good functionality, we?re accustomed to, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing missing here is multi-touch zooming and if you?ve used an Android with this feature you?ll immediately feel the difference. Sadly, Android isn?t quite suited for zooming in and out without the pinch gesture and feels laggy and unnatural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting back to the gallery, images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient ? just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. Online albums at Picasa show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also organize the photos by date via a button in the top right corner which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is as basic as you can get<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of the Galaxy Pro B7510 is nothing to rave about. It covers only the basic 3GP and MP4 formats and doesn?t even have an icon in the menu. The only way to get at it is through the file browser or the gallery. Watching DivX or XviD movies is a no-go with the default player though Samsung official specs advise otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in the Samsung Galaxy Pro is blessed with the TouchWiz UI as well. You can sort the music using the sorting options, which are neatly displayed in a tabbed interface. Among the options are current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music experience on the Galaxy Mini can be enhanced thanks to the included equalizer in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as usability and looks go the music player on the Galaxy Pro is top notch and offers everything from creating playlists to enabling equalizer settings and enjoying an enhanced audio experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Passable audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 audio is hardly the best we have seen, but given the device market positioning, it's more than adequate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an external amplifier the smartphone is slightly on the quiet side, but it achieved some great results all over the place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hit that the performance takes when headphones are connected is quite substantial though - stereo crosstalk spikes, intermodulation distortion rises too, while frequency response is no longer perfect. Volume levels aren't spectacular here either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mini is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro is equipped with a 3.2 MP snapper with autofocus, capable of producing images of 2048x1536 resolution. Sadly, the Galaxy Pro doesn?t feature a camera flash so night shots are out of the question. And there?s no dedicated camera button either, but considering the form factor it wouldn?t be very comfortable to use it in portrait anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI of the camera itself is touch-friendly and has great built-in features such as smile shot, preset scenes on-screen guidelines and panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual quality of the photos is good, especially considering that it?s only a 3.2MP snapper. Contrast is good, there?s a pretty decent amount of detail and noise is kept very low. For a messenger phone and a non-camera oriented device, the Galaxy Pro takes some great photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a macro shot made with the Galaxy Pro.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording maxes out at the very bottom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apart from the TouchWiz camcorder UI we can hardly say anything good about the video capturing capabilities of the Galaxy Pro. It would?ve been a great handset 5 years ago but today QVGA doesn?t even begin to cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video created by the Galaxy Pro is good for an MMS and nothing more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s an  untouched video sample from the Galaxy Pro.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Pro is worldwide roaming-ready with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity package offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo enables Bluetooth file transfers, so there?s little else to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pro doesn?t pack much internal memory (133MB is downright low for app installation), but it comes with a microSD slot with supports for cards up to 32GB. Thanks to Android Froyo you can install compatible apps on the SD card though we admit, it might be a hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy Mini hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall any self-respecting smartphone messenger should offer the complete connectivity package and the Galaxy Pro delivers on it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stripped Android browser fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device. It?s relatively fast, generally bug-free and really easy to use. In the case of the Galaxy Pro it?s truly stripped and feels low end in a way with the low resolution display, lack of multi-touch and flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface, at least, is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The supported zoom methods are double tap and the zooming icons, labeled ?+? and ?-?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history. Most visited is self-explanatory and history shows your last visited pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8? landscape display offers enough real estate for even complex pages but the low resolution just can?t handle showing too much on it. Overall not a very good Android browsing experience, topped with the lack of flash, which makes watching videos a no go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Coming to the organizing skills of the Galaxy Pro we have almost no complaints. It has a nice preload of apps and those that are missing can be downloaded through the android market easily and in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app is very good. It has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. The voice recorder is good too and offers the same usability as on a Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app is decent and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. But you don?t have the Stopwatch, the Timer and World Clock options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick office is here too and offers support for viewing all manner of office documents. You?ll have to cash out for the editing functions to be unlocked though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we come to the notes application. It?s great and offers perfect usability. You can store as many notes as you like and even change the color of the note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall great organizing package but this should come as no surprise as the Galaxy Pro is a smartphone with droid blood in its plastic veins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps for QVGA resolution is limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pro is running on Android version 2.2 (Froyo) so it?s a little behind its family members. The Android Market is where you can download thousands of apps for whatever you can think of and the Mini will have no problems running them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is another place where the Galaxy Pro loses ground due to limitations. The QVGA resolution is a limitation and we guess pretty soon the software version will be one too. Hopefully, the Galaxy Pro will get Gingerbread just like the Galaxy Ace, Gio and even the Mini will.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS the Google way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pro packs a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about five minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is on board, complete with Navigation, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though, and it relies on Internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re not content with Google Maps as your primary navigation app you can always go for a third-party one but keep in mind that the galaxy Pro doesn?t offer one and you?ll need to browse the Android Market and even need to prepare a couple of bucks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510 is not a phone to stun and impress. It sure is the first Android messenger by Samsung but not likely to have a prominent place in the company?s lineup. That?s not necessarily a bad thing though ? the first thing for the Galaxy Pro to worry about is finding its right audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are phones that can?t escape the Blackberry-wannabe label. But the Galaxy Pro has a solid argument against that ? Android. You know, imitation is in the natural order of things if we?re talking about basic feature phones. But with Android inside, you can?t help but feel it?s all part of a bigger plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the Galaxy Pro though ? its stand-out feature is the QWERTY keyboard and it just couldn?t have been better.If it?s the messaging that you?re after, you won?t be disappointed at all. A perfect keyboard is not alone either ?Android is good at email, there are lots of social apps and the Galaxy Pro is no stranger to Facebook, Twitter and MySpace. There is a free document viewer inside too, which can be upgraded to enable editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aiming at the mid-range, the Galaxy Pro probably has most of the features you could expect ? passable screen and camera, all the connectivity you may need, including Wireless N and Bluetooth 3.0. The Android 2.2 Froyo inside may not be the latest version, but it runs well on the 800MHz processor powering the Galaxy Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you could live with the average screen, then your only concern should be the OS limitations due to the QVGA resolution. Lots of apps in the Android Market don?t support it, so your app choice will be limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The competition at the moment is patchy ? there is the outdated and quite cheap Acer beTouch E130 running on Android 1.6 and also the also cheap T-Mobile exclusive Motorola CHARM. The later runs on Android 2.1 Eclair, but in case you live in USA you?re a T-Mobile user, then it is not an option for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Acer beTouch E130 ? Motorola CHARM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, there is quite a gang of QWERTY bars preparing to hit the market in the next couple of months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Acer and HTC are arming QWERTY droid bars based on 600MHz processors. HTC ChaCha is already available on pre-order for about &#x20ac;290 and will hit the stores next month. It runs on Android 2.4 Gingerbread, has the fancy HTC Sense on top of it plus an HVGA display and a dedicated hardware Facebook key. On the other hand is the Acer beTouch E210 running on the Android 2.2 Froyo and with a QVGA screen. The E210, though, should come with a seriously cheaper price.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you need more power and you?re ready to pay for it, then you should wait for the Motorola Pro. It has a lot better 1GHz processor and PowerVR SGX530 graphics, a bigger 3.1-inch HVGA display (but a smaller QWERTY keyboard) and better camera. It also runs on Android Froyo but Motorola has done some MotoBLUR magic on it. Unfortunately, there is still no official info on the pricing and the availability so it might take a while.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia has an excellent competitor in the labs that should be released soon - the E6. We already met with Nokia E6 and we were quite impressed. It runs on the latest Symbian Anna, comes with one of the highest dpi screens out there ? a 2.46 capacitive display with VGA resolution. There?s also an 8 megapixel snapper and 720p video recording. Add the stainless steel panels and the Gorilla glass protected screen, and we might have the next Nokia bestseller here. If you are willing pay at least &#x20ac;100 more for those features, then you should wait for the E6.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The competition is more or less irrelevant if you factor in all the existing customers using a Corby, Omnia or even older Windows-powered Samsung messengers. But whether the Galaxy Pro will become a bestseller, is not so important. It?s a good enough phone to give Android a try. That should probably be enough for most of its target users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we look at the bigger picture though ? it?s the evolution of the messenger form factor that?s a lot more interesting. Like it or not ? even the once revered Eseries find it hard to keep up. An E6 will never have the clout of an E71. With BlackBerries in a league of their own as usual, the QWERTY messengers of today are inching towards touchscreen. Like it or not. The versatility of Android may as well be a game changer yet again.</paragraph>
