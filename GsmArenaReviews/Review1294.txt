			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Honey, I shrunk the Xperia arc. No, that's a different story. And yes, we like the Sony Ericsson minis. But that's not how the real story of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray goes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They did things to the Xperia arc. They took out its beating heart and carved a new phone out of it. But this isn't a scary story, it has a happy ending. It feels the Ray was always living inside the Xperia arc, waiting to be released. Like a seed that will grow a new plant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's how we imagine the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray was born. They cracked the rock open to get to the gem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray had to shed off layers of armor but lost none of the courage. It's got all the exciting ingredients of the Xperia arc. The sharp BRAVIA engine display is there and so is the 8MP camera, complete with 720p video recording. And the ray is impressively thin too. It is one of the most compact members of the Xperia family, and one of the handsomest phones we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the arc is slimmer but it's a massive handset. The mini is tiny but too chubby at 16mm. If you want a really slim and compact droid, the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is one of the few that fit the bill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen takes much credit for the phone's good looks. The BRAVIA engine unit has the impressive pixel density of 300ppi. We had a close look at the advantages of the BRAVIA engine and the improvements are tangible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen isn't the only thing to borrow from the wealth of Sony experience. The 8MP camera packs an Exmor R sensor, which boasts improved low-light performance. It also captures 720p video with continuous autofocus - on paper, you get the same camera as in the Xperia arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on with the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray's story, you should get to know the protagonist better. Here's the list of all the virtues and the vices as we saw them:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ray is powered by the 1GHz processor with 512MB RAM and Adreno 205 graphics, courtesy of the Qualcomm MSM8255 chipset that is prevalent in the Xperia line. It's no match for dual-core, but if it's good enough for the gaming-centered Xperia Play, the ray shouldn?t have any issues with speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the hardware on the inside is pretty familiar and so is the software. But the slender, eye-catching body is the big deal so we'll focus on that first. We'll also rummage through the retail box, so follow us on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard sales package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray comes with a compact charger with a USB port in which you plug in the supplied USB cable. The cable is long and the microUSB end is L-shaped, which makes sense given the USB port on the ray is on its left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a one-piece headset too, which uses ear buds rather than in-ear design. There's a 4GB microSD card in the box too, enough to fit a respectable music collection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is topped off with the usual set of manuals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia ray 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Sony Ericsson Xperia ray stands at 111 x 53 x 9.4 mm and tips the scales at 100 grams sharp.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray moves away from the predominant Xperia line styling and gets closer to the minis instead. That design has the advantage of a big home button, but the Back and Menu keys are capacitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a perfectly usable combination, perhaps more comfortable to use than the thin hardware controls on the recent Xperia phones. It looks good too. The back of the Xperia ray is completely flat - no curve to it, but since the phone is narrow that doesn?t affect ergonomics and makes the phone stable when you put it on a table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the design team did a very good job on the phone - the ray is a looker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sharp display with BRAVIA engine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine Reality display on the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc is hands down one of the best LCD displays we've ever seen. It has FWVGA resolution (480 x 854 pixels), and a 16:9 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high resolution on a relatively small diagonal gives it 297ppi pixel density - just shy of the elusive 300ppi density which, according to no other than Steve Jobs, Apple?s CEO, himself, is the picture-perfect ideal for phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being an LCD unit, the Reality display suffers from color shift when viewed at an angle - light blues for example noticeably tend towards light green when you tilt the phone. Contrast is also reduced slightly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the up side, the screen boasts excellent contrast and deep darks. It's helped by the non-reflective surface coating, which leads to excellent sunlight legibility. Colors are very rich - beyond what the Xperia arc or the iPhone 4 can offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mobile BRAVIA engine further enhances the image quality in software - it borrows tricks from Sony's TVs. It boosts contrast and saturation and performs noise reduction. It also sharpens the image, which would usually lead to jaggies but with the extra-small pixels of the Xperia ray screen, they're not really noticeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we couldn?t run our display test as the auto brightness software could not be turned off and we couldn?t get reliable readings at 50% and 100% brightness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and feel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the usual lineup of an earpiece, proximity and ambient light sensors and a front-facing camera. Below the screen is the hardware Home key flanked by capacitive Back and Menu keys. Those two don't have clearly defined borders, so keep in mind you have to aim for the back and menu symbols and not to the side or below the key (haptic feedback lets you know your tap has been successful).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home key is a bit stiff but it got our attention with the illuminated strip around it. It can glow in different colors - white, red, green and blue. It works as a charge indicator and certain apps and serves as a notification light (e.g. blinks green for missed calls). Third party software couldn't control the light, unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Xperia ray houses the microUSB port, which doubles as a charger plug. With Android 2.3.4 it will also work as a USB On-The-Go port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the right side of the phone - it's small, quite thin and not very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top there's the Power/Lock key in the middle, which is small, rounded and comfortable to press (though not prone to accidental presses), and the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom there's the mic pinhole and the lanyard eyelet, plus a small groove to put a fingernail under and pull the back cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray comes in the usual Black and White color schemes, but if you find those dull, you can also grab it in Gold (as in Golden) or Pink. For the preview, we had the Black version, which had a nice matte black finish on the back and for the review we got the Pink version, which has a bright, eye-catching glossy finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back, there's the 8MP auto-focus camera and the LED flash. There's virtually no protection against scratches or smudges for the camera lens, so you'd need to be careful with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is also at the back, right next to the Sony Ericsson logo. The logo protrudes slightly, but the loudspeaker still lies too low and gets muffled. The secondary microphone is near the camera/flash duo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the back cover reveals the battery and the SIM and microSD cards nestled next to it. You can't pull either out without removing the battery first, which isn't a big deal for the SIM card, but not having a hot-swappable microSD card can be a drag some times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the battery is all good news - Sony Ericsson has managed to fit a massive 1500mAh battery in the compact Xperia ray. Official numbers promise up to nearly 18 days of standby (in 2G, a bit more in 3G) and almost 7 hours of talk time (in 2G, exactly 7 hours in 3G). The battery should also be good for 36 hours of non-stop music playback if the official numbers are to be believed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Part of the inner body of the Xperia ray is made of metal, which gives the phone excellent rigidity. Still, the outside is all plastic so you don't get the metal unibody feel you get from other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16:9 aspect ratio of the screen dictates the overall shape of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray - it's tall and narrow, which made the ray very comfortable to hold up as a phone. Pocketing the ray is a breeze too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the downside, most 3"-3.2" displays use HVGA resolution and by comparison, the wider display of the ray is smaller than you would expect. Actually, a 16:9 3.3" display has about 8% smaller surface area than a 3.2" display of the 3:2 aspect ratio, which most Androids have (think of the standard issue 320 x 480 pixel resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the build quality of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is solid. It?s all plastic, but the scratch-resistant glass on the front should prevent minor damage to the front of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is a beauty and the small frame reveals little of what it's really capable of. The styling is minimalist but the clean sharp lines instill a sense of confidence and strength.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface - Xperia-infused Gingerbread<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray makes no changes to the software borrowed from the Arc and the Neo. What it means is you get Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread with a very polished custom skin and a nice package of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a video of the user interface in action, which is a good starting point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray has a five pane homescreen (you can't add or delete panes), with four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen also does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All your widgets gather there and you can click the one you want and go to its screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality, it?s similar to the HTC Leap view or what Samsung do in TouchWiz. However widgets here are not crammed in small hard-to-read screens. Instead, they?re all shuffled on a single screen, so they can better use the space and remain as big as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray has some custom-made Sony Ericsson widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher puts shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid. You can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually shuffle the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is simple, using the iOS logic (and visual layout). You drag one icon over another and a pop-up prompts you to select an icon and a name for the folder you?re about to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is standard Xperia fare. Which means you get notifications for Facebook events too. The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon chipset has been around for a while and we know what to expect from it in terms of performance. Sony Ericsson already used this setup in several of their phones and the Xperia ray is on par with the Arc and the Neo. The results are virtually identical, within the usual benchmark margin of error. Looking back at some of our other benchmarks, the Xperia ray even manages to outperform old high-enders like the Samsung Galaxy S.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SNS-aware phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray?s visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. Info for each contact is presented in side-swipable interface that holds contact info, recent calls and more info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can ?join? their contact info to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony still misses smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray held on to signal well and we didn?t experience dropped calls. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Xperia ray does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray automatically disables the touchscreen when you hold it next to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray. Scoring a Below Average result, the ray isn't the loudest ringer around, so you might occasionally miss a call. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hidden in the Sound settings is xLOUD, a feature that claims to improve speaker loudness. A quick test shows deeper sound, but we also used our digital noise/loudness meter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>xLOUD made a difference of about 5dB when you sum up the tests ? but with or without it, the Xperia ray scores Below Average (note, the results in the table are with xLOUD on). It's not just a straightforward increase though - it boosts lower frequencies, while high frequencies (and high frequency ringtones) remain mostly untouched.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sound messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use search to locate a specific message in all conversations. You can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email app can do that however. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A preview pane splits the screen in half - one side lists the emails, while the other shows the currently selected email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works both in portrait and landscape and you can easily drag the separator between the two areas to make one bigger. Unfortunately, this feature works much better on a tablet than on the Xperia ray's small screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input is a little cramped<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia ray offers a pretty standard keyboard. By default, the portrait mode keyboard is multitap, but you can switch to QWERTY too. Though the tall, narrow screen makes typing on a portrait QWERTY harder than on most phones - at least you have spell correction to sort out minor typos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The on-screen keyboard takes more than most the screen and leaves only two lines for text. It does give you large, easy to tap buttons though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Haptic feedback can be enabled for the keyboard, which helps improve accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One addition to the keyboard is a row on top that gives you left/right arrows to move the cursor and a hide keyboard button. You also get the usual "handle" to move the cursor when you tap in the text field. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery on BRAVIA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have added support for Facebook albums too. They are distinguished by the small Facebook logo on them and when viewing individual pics from that album, you can "like" them with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Thanks to the Xperia ray's multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS also comes in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors, as it sharpens the image and reduces noise. These steps would normally lead to artifacts, but the high-density screen of the Xperia ray makes them invisible. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend you keep it on - it really improves the image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback - only 3GP and MP4 welcome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia ray as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Xperia ray did play a 720p MP4 video (but not 1080p). And the 3.3? FWVGA Reality screen offers excellent image quality (the BRAVIA engine comes into play here too) and spot-on aspect ratio, which compensates for the small size (a 3.2" HVGA screen would either show a smaller image or have to crop it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you re-encode your videos before hand, the Xperia ray can make a good PMP. Or you could just download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier. This would address other deficiencies of the Xperia ray video player, like lack of subtitles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with handy Infinite button<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia ray is the same app you get in the Arc and the Neo. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get a search shortcut, as well as send and delete options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key. The latter lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the rich selection of equalizer presets. You also get Silent mode, which mutes all other sounds except for alarms - great for uninterrupted listening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Gallery, the Music player on the Xperia ray lets you "like" tracks you're listening to, which posts it on your wall. Later on, you can discuss them with your friends through the Friends' music and videos app (sometimes called Media discovery). There's a widget too, so you can always be up to date with what you're friends are listening to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS, TrackID onboard too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray audio output is decent, but strangely, slightly worse than that of the other Sony Ericsson smartphones that we have tested recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The output is especially convincing when you use the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray with an active external amplifier. As you can see from the table below it got great scores across the board in that scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there was quite significant degradation when we connected a pair of headphones, most notably in terms of stereo crosstalk and distortion. The crosstalk shot well above the average and distortion levels were no longer impressive. Plus, there was a drop in volume so this is not really a commendable effort on ray's behalf.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera does OK but not spectacularly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray boasts an 8 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED light. Much like the Arc, the ray uses an Exmor R backlit sensor, which promises improved low-light performance - we'll test that for ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia ray are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. The left one holds five shortcuts to various settings, while the right one shows thumbnails of the five most recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pull to expand the settings taskbars or push them out of sight. It?s a clever solution that lets you pick how much of the camera controls are seen in the viewfinder. The shortcuts in the left column can be rearranged and you can replace some of them with others from the extended menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between three capture modes - Normal, Scene recognition or Smile detection. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia ray take a guess (it's fairly good at it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other settings include changing the resolution, toggling between front/back camera, photo light (but it's switched manually, not automatically as a flash), geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode. Also at your disposal are a self-timer, shutter sound, exposure, white balance and metering settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray handles the lack of a physical shutter key by making the entire viewfinder a virtual shutter key. You can press and hold to engage the autofocus. Touch focus is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is good - comparable to that of the Neo but not quite like the Arc. Noise levels are kept relatively low and photos have good contrast and colors. The amount of captured detail isn't among the best in the 8MP league however. Purple fringing and oversharpening are evident in high-contrast areas, but nothing drastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another downside of the camera is that it has a tendency to overexpose shots, especially when there are a lot of shadows in the shot. On the upside, the Xperia ray manages to keep some detail in those shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tested Sony Ericsson's claims regarding the Exmor R sensor. We snapped two photos in the dark, in poor lighting, with the Xperia ray and the Samsung Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray photos are clearly brighter, but with a lot of noise (which was to be expected). Tuning the S II photo brings up some detail in the dark areas but it's still marginally less than what the ray shows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Xperia ray provides slightly better shots in the dark and is better at picking the proper settings for such a shot too (no need to manually edit the photos for one).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray to our Photo Compare database. The tool?s page has a quick how to guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ray performs very well on the black on white lines of the first chart though the oversharpening is still easy to spot. The mostly flat grey of the second chart however brings out the noise - the grass and gravel squares fared quite well though, with reasonable amounts of detail left in them. The final chart shows good color rendering.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Midrange 720p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray captures 720p video at 30 fps and does a good job of it. The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera - focus mode, metering, exposure value and image stabilization are user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ray?s camcorder joins the select few with continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeating attempts to lock focus that may ruin a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 format with an overall bitrate of about 6.2Mbps. Frame rate hovers at just under the 30fps mark and there are no duplicated frames. The amount of captured detail is on the low side however and there are jaggies on diagonal lines (the relatively low bitrate is at least partially to blame here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs for audio capture are much more pleasing - sound is recorded at 130Kbps in stereo 48KHz format, which is very good for the class (and even overall for droid video cams).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p samples that we captured with the Xperia ray:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched sample 720p@30fps (12s, 9.4MB), taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively low bitrate doesn?t allow the Xperia ray to keep much detail in the videos - but the difference is less than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exposure adjustment is gradual too so it's not sudden or pulsating (and annoying) as in some other phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid connectivity with USB OTG<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray has a good deal of connectivity options. The basics are covered by quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n) and Bluetooth 2.1 for wireless local connectivity. The Connected devices app turns your Xperia ray into a DLNA server, letting you view media on DLNA-enabled devices (e.g. TV, PlayStation 3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB v2.0 port handles both wired data transfer and charging. With the Android 2.3.4 update, it also gets USB On-The-Go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LiveWare manager app lets you assign specific apps to be launched when a given accessory is connected, which can be quite handy (e.g. launch music player when you plug in headphones or a file browser for flash memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage has 300MB only available to the user, but you can expand it up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone will ship with a 4GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard 3.5mm audio jack completes the connectivity tally. Unfortunately, there's no HDMI port as on the Xperia arc and the Neo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser could use more screen real estate, but runs Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is simple, with almost no visible chrome by default. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 3.3? screen to fill with actual content, but the relatively small space still doesn?t fit all that much. There are three way to zoom in the Xperia ray?s browser: double tap, dedicated virtual controls and the pinch gesture. There's text reflow, which reformats text so that it best fits on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important new features in the web browser is the full Flash support. YouTube videos played smoothly at 360p (unless you're scrolling the page, which leads to slight lag). Higher res videos (including 480p) are too choppy to watch. Flash games however played trouble free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The organizer is full suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable on the high-resolution screen and panning is blazing fast. The screen is smallish, but OfficeSuite will reformat the document to fit the screen better. Full-screen mode also helps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with both Gmail and the generic email app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. The generic Email app even lets you download the attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for Agenda: a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Events appear just like regular events but you can't edit them from the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can pull out advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either. There's plenty of those in the Android Market though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps, A-GPS and limited navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray comes with a GPS receiver, which took about 3-4 minutes to get satellite lock from a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks or the network positioning if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our unit came with Maps 5.1 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without a connection though. There are also 3D buildings, two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, those features aren?t available everywhere. 3D buildings are available mostly in the biggest world cities. Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street view is, as usual, a part of the standard package - it gives you a panoramic view of every bit of road in the covered areas. With the compass mode enabled, it feels like a virtual tour of the place!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray should come with Wisepilot pre-installed (ours didn?t though). Still, if you're going to use it for navigation, you'll have to purchase a license - Wisepilot doesn?t do that out of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market stocks a ton of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray runs a very recent version of Android and has a FWVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market. The MSM8255 chipset should be able to handle most apps in there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and three buttons (Applications, Games and My apps). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Almost nothing went missing when Sony Ericsson turned the magnification down to change the arc into the ray. The HDMI port was dropped out, which is a pity. Had the Xperia ray been able to pair with an HDTV, the screen size would've been irrelevant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of it, the sharp 3.3" Reality display on the Xperia ray is one of the best LCDs we've seen yet. Even the battery, which is the second thing to go when phones get smaller has the whopping 1500mAh capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not everything that's the same on paper is the same in real life though - the 8MP camera of the Xperia ray isn't as good as the one on the arc. It's still pretty good, so we'll let this one slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been a while since we've been able to recommend a Symbian phone as an alternative to a droid, but right now, the Nokia 700 is the closest pick. It offers an eye-catching 3.2" 16:9 ClearBlack AMOLED screen, a 1GHz processor and Symbian Belle (which closes the gap on Android in terms of usability). There's the slender 9.7mm frame and 720p video camera too (though the still camera is a less than stellar 5MP fixed-focus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other alternatives are either bigger, with poorer specs, or too old already. The Nokia 701 is worth a look for Symbian Belle, the metal body and super bright screen. The Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 is an option if you want a compact droid on a budget. Then there's the original Samsung S8500 Wave with a 3.3" WVGA SuperAMOLED screen, metal body and Bada OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing you might want to do is wait for the next generation iPhone to come out and snatch the iPhone 4 on a lower price. It's got it all - the looks, the excellent screen, the very good camera, the performance and the apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 701 ? Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 ? Samsung S8500 Wave ? Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson is exploring a niche that other makers have mostly neglected, which gives the Xperia ray a lot of opportunity to widen their user base. And success will be well deserved - the ray does most of what it sets out to do just right. And it's too hot to pass by.</paragraph>
