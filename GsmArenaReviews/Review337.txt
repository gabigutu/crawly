			<paragraph>Visually appealing, the Samsung E950 is a feature-rich handset that takes Samsung?s idea of touch sensitive interface one step further. Fitted into a compact slider body you get a 3 megapixel camera, microSD card slot, FM radio, stereo Bluetooth and a 2? TFT display with a QVGA resolution. The handset is equipped with a novel input solution ? a dedicated touchscreen that serves as a navigation D-pad. That feature alone was enough to get us itching with impatience to lay our hands on one of those phones. Join us as we explore the Samsung E950 slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 is obviously the successor of last-year?s Samsung E900. Both handsets feature full touch sensitive navigation throughout the phone?s interface. Besides being among the first handsets with touch-based navigation, the E900 failed to impress with technical specifications when compared to the other high-end Samsung handsets at the time. The same holds true for the E950 now. Samsung have more advanced handsets currently, so we guess the E950 will mostly count on exciting technology (unique touchscreen pad) and fashion appeal (this baby just looks great).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having had our deal of Samsung reviews in the past month, we were still excited to see how far Samsung would go with that touch-pad, touch-screen and touch-everything extravaganza. So, we got busy with an early pre-release version of the Samsung E950.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps this is the right place for a little disclaimer. Being a pre-sales piece , our Samsung E950 suffered from some serious bugs. We do hope though they?ll be fixed in the retail version .</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You know the drill<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 measures 98 x 46 x 15 mm, which doesn?t make it the slimmest slider currently available, but in terms of size the Samsung E950 is pretty compact and even light. The mobile makes good use of metal and matt black plastic. We like the design and the construction itself seems pretty solid. Thanks to the touch-sensitive elements on the front panel, the surface is smooth and there are no keys sticking out. The touch-sensitive navigation display is inside a silver frame at the lower end. A slight recess above the display nests the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the handset powers up you will see that the touchpad display has red backlighting and white fonts unlike the one shown on advertisements (black with white fonts). Personally, we don?t like the choice of red for the backlighting. Our guess is that they used it to match the dark red styling of the user interface, but, who knows?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alpha-numeric keypad is really flat, but keys are large enough and have sufficient press feedback, so typing is easy and precise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset features the volume rocker and the universal port for plugging the charger, the headset, and the data cable. Samsung don?t offer a 3.5 mm audio jack or even an adapter which is a definite downside, since the originally included headset isn?t always the best there is. The same port is used for connecting the TV-out cable ? the availability of this cable in the retail package is region dependent and you might end up buying one separately in order to use the TV-out feature. In the upper corner of the left side you will also notice a wrist/neck strap eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom and top sides of the handset are completely bereft of controls. On the top however you will notice the fine brushed texture of the metallic parts of the Samsung E950. More of that is to follow when we review the back panel. The right side of Samsung E950 sports an On/Off key and the dedicated camera release button. The On/Off key can also be used to unlock the handset when the slider is closed or even wake up the touch-sensitive keypad if you let it turn off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel looks great ? the metallic finish is remarkably tasteful and pleasant to the touch. As usual with sliders, the camera on the back is only revealed when you slide the handset open. The camera module sits next to a self-portrait mirror and a LED flash. The metallic back panel features a really stylish loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the back panel is an easy task ? slide it up and there it goes. The battery cover doesn?t seem to hold firm enough, but it should do its day-to-day job just fine. Removing it reveals the battery, the SIM card holder and the memory card bed. The microSD memory card bed is hot-swap enabled ? you can exchange cards without turning the phone off. The Samsung E950 features a pretty much standard Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 900 mAh. So far, there is no word from the manufacturer on the expected battery life, and we can?t tell for sure. In our hands it lasted no more than a day, but that may well be attributed to our test handset being a pre-sales unit. Or best guess is that the battery will keep the E950 running for around 3 days when used moderately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Samsung E950 was generally a nice experience. The sliding mechanism was not the best we?ve seen, but we are pretty confident that it will change in the final retail version. It was as if the handset had ?beta version? written all over. Nevertheless ignoring all the little bugs, it gave us a pretty clear idea of how the final product will work and feel. Speaking of feeling, holding Samsung E950 is a pleasant experience ? it fits great in your hand, there?s no trouble sliding it open or closed with your thumb.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Taking your time with the keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung E950 the borderline between keypad and display is a bit blurred, as the keypad itself uses a display to navigate you through the menus. This extraordinary solution demands some special attention without a doubt. The touchscreen D-pad visualizes different context icons based on where you are within the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve got several screenshots of this intriguing navigation solution to show you how it adapts according to the currently running application. The standard home screen layout prompts that pressing the Up direction will open the proprietary Samsung MyMenu (a list of user-configurable shortcuts). Launching the music player turns the touchpad into music controls. The layout changes once more when you turn on the Calculator for example. And finally, the touchpad display lights up with an image of a charging battery when you plug in the charger. It should be noted that these shortcuts are valid throughout the whole range of Samsung handsets ? the only difference is that here they get visualized on the touchpad itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Different touchpad layouts: home screen ? music player ? calculator ? charging</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said all that, we should point out that we are pretty disappointed with the touchpad user-friendliness. The touch-sensitive keys surrounding it have a rather uneven backlighting and their performance is unreliable at best. Touching any of those sometimes produced an effect, while other times nothing happened at all. The situation with the touchpad sensitivity was pretty much the same. Topped with the somewhat slow interface response when you operate the touchpad, this new navigation solution from Samsung turns into a disaster. We really hope that these bugs will be tweaked up in the final version, because problems of this kind are a real deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alpha-numeric keypad of the Samsung E950 doesn?t suffer from any of these drawbacks and using it was a nice experience. It provides great tactile feedback together with large keys to conveniently rest your thumb on. It?s again backlit in white, with the backlighting being just a tad uneven. The 262K color TFT display proved great too and we are more than happy with its performance. It doesn?t do that well under bright sunlight, but the software Sunlight mode that boosts brightness and contrast manages to alleviate the situation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Colorful dial pad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The speaker of the Samsung E950 is good and really loud. At the highest levels you will never miss your call even in a noisy street. You can make or receive calls even with the slider closed. Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung and this time they?ve again included a bunch of dialing animations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The main menu is alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 home screen is fully user-configurable. Service icons provide information on signal strength, battery, as well as info about the inserted memory card. Several clock styles are available. You can set a photo or other image as a background, and even use two or more alternating images. The proprietary Samsung uGo feature automatically updates the home screen background to display landmarks of the city or country you?re in. The scenery even changes when night falls. In standby the upwards direction of the navigation pad activates the proprietary Samsung My Menu. It features several user-configurable shortcuts for your convenience. As it has always been with Samsung handsets, pressing the confirming key on the pad in standby launches the web browser ? a truly inconvenient solution but eventually one gets used to that. The handset also has an Offline mode that disconnects all wireless transmissions so that you can still use it as a camera or as a music player in places where the use of mobile phones is prohibited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 features a new style of main menu called Espresso user interface, which we haven?t seen before in previous models of the Korean manufacturer. The menu itself is no longer black, but dark red. The icons have gotten really small in order to make room for a new animated visualization of the currently selected icon. The animated visualization appears in the lower portion of the screen, while the icons are set above it. Overall, the effect is nice and we would have appreciated this new eye-candy style if it wasn?t for the choppy animation, which spoiled the fun for us. The number of the icons displayed is a total of twelve and as with most past models the menu features a white color scheme. It proves good when used in bright sunlight. The white theme however is applied only to the listed submenus and not to the main menu itself. The handset does feature a Sunlight mode which boosts the display brightness and contrast in order to allow better legibility under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice upgrade over previous models is the change of the system font used. It?s sleeker and the characters are more compact which means that almost all of the listed submenus fit on the screen with no need for side scrolling, as seen in models such as Samsung D900 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with almost all of the past Samsung handsets, no ringing profiles are available. All you have at your disposal is the Silent and Normal ringing modes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Spacious phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung E950 can store up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. It can display the names from the phone memory only or all names from both the phone memory and the SIM card at once. Searching employs gradual typing. Samsung E950 does not search in both the contact?s name and last name. That option though was available back in Samsung D900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A total of 12 fields of information are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers for each contact plus an email address and a note. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture; contacts can be organized into groups, but calls cannot be filtered on the base of created groups. Contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth. The only thing that?s missing here is a field for a contact?s birthday.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There aren?t any innovations in the call management department. The Dial key on the touchpad opens a list of the recent contacts, while opening the Call log from the main menu will provide additional details. A small innovation is the addition of a message counter, which monitors the received and sent messages ? we missed that feature in the first Samsung Ultra lineup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Add color to your messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E950 manages SMS, EMS, MMS, and emails. SMS, EMS and MMS use one and the same editor. MMS are created through a selection from the menu or by inserting an image, which makes the editor automatically switch from SMS to MMS. EMS allows you to apply formatting and font colors to your text messages. SMS can have maximum 1836 characters (12 messages). The number of the 160-symbol chunks that a longer message breaks down to is shown in the upper part of the message composer. T9 dictionary is there to assist you; both browsing and adding new words is fast and intuitive. If sending fails, say because of a network failure, the message is saved to the Outbox. The Samsung E950 can store up to 1000 messages (Samsung D900, for example could only store 200).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is relatively good. It can manage up to four accounts ? POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at predefined intervals (user-configurable, of course). The only downside we found with the mail client is the lack of support for SSL, which practically means that if you own a secure SSL mail account you cannot use it with the Samsung E950 (Gmail is a nice example). A nice feature in most of the Samsung handsets is the ability to block email messages from certain senders or messages with certain subjects. You cannot use that filter for incoming SMS messages as you could in D900.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The secret files<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 file browser is pretty much standard for Samsung handsets. The phone memory and the memory card are separate but they both have the same folder structure. There are folders for different types of files ? images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. Functionality of the file browser is sufficient. You can copy or move files ? both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete folders (except for the primary ones). Files can be sent again one by one or in bulk via Bluetooth. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent deleting by accident.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 picture gallery is a part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder. You can copy or move images but only to the Images folder on the memory card and vice versa. Unfortunately, the picture gallery has been cut down a bit compared to Samsung D900. Here you cannot view the pictures as a plain list, only list with thumbnails is available and, further, you cannot sort files by file type or size. All files are sorted by their date of creation by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view the picture full screen, but only in portrait mode (landscape pictures get cropped a bit). Additionally, you can zoom in on a picture in up to 8 steps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can do a bit of editing on your pictures using the integrated Scalado Image Editor, which is quite fast and rich in features. Processing images is quick but editing still takes time since all the features are organized in deep submenus which makes applying different effects rather sluggish. The Scalado Image Editor allows you to apply 14 special filters such as stamp, black and white, sepia, negative , milky, antique, fog, moonlight, color boost, posterize, solarize, blur, and sharpen. Then you can get serious with other effects like despeckle, noise, oil paint, emboss, sketch, sketch color, cartoon, paint, frosted glass, magic pen, spotlight, mirror. You can also adjust levels, brightness, contrast and color. You can of course flip, rotate and crop the image, as well as apply one of 10 warp styles that make pretty funny portrait images. Options are so many that elaborating on all of them calls for a full-fledged software review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with 70MB of internal memory and a microSD card slot, the Samsung E950 can be comfortably used as a portable music player. The Music player application allows filtering tracks by author or album, or you can choose to play either the tracks you?ve recently listened to or the ones that you?ve played the most. Custom playlists can be created too. You can minimize the application to continue playing in the background. The player does have several equalizer presets (you cannot create one of your own) plus a 3D sound effect. You can also make use of some pretty loud volume levels. You can also rate tracks and mark them as your favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with most Samsung handsets, the retail box will supply you with a wired headset that comes complete with a microphone and a remote control. There?s not an option to replace those, as Samsung doesn?t offer a standard audio jack adapter. You can use however a Bluetooth headset for listening to music ? both a mono and a stereo one will do the job as Samsung E950 supports the Bluetooth A2DP profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the audio hardware used in the Samsung E950, it has to be noted that it?s once again a product of the collaboration between Samsung and Bang&amp;Olufsen. The two companies have their history of cooperation, and the first IcePower-enabled mobile handsets we saw were the Samsung F300 and Samsung U600. The Samsung E950 also comes with an IcePower amplifier mobile chip. According to a third-party test, the volume level of IcePower-enabled devices is 20-25% louder in comparison to the second generation of Sony Ericsson Walkman mobiles. The sound quality hasn?t changed much, as there?s no dedicated sound processor (music is processed by the main ARM9 processor), however according to the Right Mark Audio Analyzer the sound experience is slightly better than rival Walkman handsets and way ahead of the S60-based devices by Nokia (except for Nokia N91). The IcePower devices lack any filters though (such as DSP), which may lead to some background noise ? only noticeable in test conditions, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 comes complete with an FM radio, which is a quite handy feature. You can store up to 30 radio stations. There is no RDS but you can set user-defined names to the stations just so you know which one to choose next time you go out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Music player and the FM radio have a similar interface; the same holds true for the video player interface, too. It doesn?t have many features but it can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos. As the camera records video in MPEG-4 format, you can rest assured that the player has full support for those ? you can easily convert your videos to watch them on the go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: LED flash and little to cheer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E950 features a 3 megapixel camera with a LED flash, which can take pictures at a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It doesn?t have auto focus, so taking shots of text and documents won?t be possible, but it does well at larger distances, and is of course faster than every auto focus enabled camera. There are several view modes ? the only way to see the whole composition is to select the ?standard ratio? viewfinder. While the fullscreen viewfinder is pleasing to the eye, it doesn?t allow you to see the whole composition you are shooting since it crops the center image and shows you only that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is intuitive and follows the current trend of showing settings with icons in the bottom of the screen while options appear as popup menus. The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single or multi-shot ), color effects (black and white, negative, sepia, emboss), white balance, and ISO. An interesting feature is the Mosaic shot seen also on previous Samsung handset, which allows you to make interesting photo collages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the photos produced by the Samsung E950 camera is average. The colors are natural but the pictures have a lot of noise when compared to a similar 3.2 megapixel camera (the one of Samsung D900 in this case).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without auto focus close-ups would prove impossible, let alone scanning text with your camera. In the same time, the handset takes pictures much faster and reliably (no focus lag), which is great for taking those spur-of-the-moment opportunist shots of moving objects. All that said, it?s worth pointing out that with most auto focus cameras you can simply turn the auto focus feature off to achieve the same results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We decided to make an improvised shootout between the Samsung E950 and the Samsung D900. Both handsets feature 3 megapixel cameras, but the D900 also has autofocus. As you all know, the autofocus doesn't necessarily improve landscape pictures such as those so the comparison is fair. If you take a look at the samples you will immediately notice the excess noise in the E950 pictures. We suppose, that it's not the sensor that messes up the things, but the software processing of the handset. That being said, it is highly possible that the retail version of the E950 might have that fixed. Since we have similar photos made by Samsung E590 (we're not publishing those here) we may easily conclude that Samsung E950 makes worse pictures than both D900 and E590.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is also able to shoot video ? in the so-called Camcorder mode. Recording length is only limited by the available free memory. The user interface of the camcorder is pretty much the same as the one of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950, as most other Samsung handsets, captures MPEG-4 videos with a maximum resolution of CIF (352 x 288 pixels) at 15 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may also see a sample Samsung E950 video clip</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser scores a mark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung E950 you can count on EDGE and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. As we?ve already mentioned, it also comes equipped with Bluetooth which even allows listening to music on a stereo headset (A2DP profile support). It works seamlessly when transferring data to and from a PC. A notable enhancement to the Bluetooth File Browser service is the ability to make certain files or folders visible or invisible according to your needs. A data cable will allow for even faster file transfers. When connected, the handset gets charged, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the phone as a modem with a PC, is also an option. Such transfers can be made via Bluetooth technology or through the data cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NetFront 3.4 web browser of the Samsung E950 is excellent for a feature phone ? it renders pages well with or without the Smart-Fit function. It offers a mini-map so that you know where you are at on large pages, and it even has a virtual cursor, which highlights the currently active hyperlink or field.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Day-to-day management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E950 calendar offers three views ? daily, weekly and monthly. There are three types of events available: appointment, anniversary and task. The Calendar can store up to 100 items of each type. Much like D900, you can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick which day the week starts on ? Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up to five alarms are available and each one of them can be set to repeat on given days of the week. There?s a separate setting for the type of snooze you would like to have for each of those five alarms. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also offers a personal task manager, a voice recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown and a stopwatch will cater to sports-minded users. Samsung E950 supports Java, so downloading additional applications or games is not a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Yahoo! ready<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to additional applications, Samsung fails to make a real mark, but, several of them are there and deserve to be mentioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Image Stamp application allows users to watermark their images ? simply select a watermark imprint, then select the image to be watermarked. Such an application is hardly a must-have on a mobile platform and is obviously meant for fun only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we saw Google search integration in the Samsung U700 that we reviewed recently, the Samsung E950 comes with an integrated Yahoo! search plus a Yahoo! messenger. Those of you using the Yahoo! services will probably be more than happy about those. They are even available as a main menu item for ease of access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recent Samsung handsets come also with an integrated search application that is rarely seen in feature phones ? the Smart search acts as a search engine, which you can use to search throughout the whole handset content ? it goes through your contacts, menus, messages, etc. Further on, the Smart Search activates automatically when you start dialing a number and shows you all the available contacts which have this number combination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, finally it is worth mentioning that the Samsung E950 has support for viewing MS Word, MS Excel and PDF files by means of the integrated Picsel viewer. The viewer itself is a nice application, but it?s rather slow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A pocketful of games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to games, Samsung have their handsets packed with them. It?s quite pleasing to see all those titles sitting in the fun corner. Alas, most the games turn out to be trial versions only. The Samsung E950 has full support for Java MDIP 2.0 so you can download additional titles and even other applications. When we say download, we mean it ? the only way to get a Java application or a game work on a Samsung handset is to download it online with the handset itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The games that the Samsung E950 bundles up are Asphalt Urban GT, Time Rider II, Bobby Carrot, Midnight Pool, Mini Golf Las Vegas, and Tetris. As you?ve probably guessed it, the most interesting of them are the trial ones. Even the minimalistic Tetris game is trial, too. If you take into account the unreliable touch pad navigation you may bet that playing those games is not such a nice experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As it turned out, the Samsung E950 is a wonderful phone, although the dodgy touchscreen navigation pad ruined the experience for us. It?s highly possible though that this problem has a lot to do with the unit being an early pre-sales piece. So, we are looking forward to the final retail version then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the handset has its pros and cons. While none of the cons is a real deal-breaker, the pros provide for a nice experience with this fashionable slider. The Samsung E950 doesn?t have a great camera or the features of a top performer. Its appeal lies elsewhere and style comes first.</paragraph>
