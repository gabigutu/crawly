			<paragraph>Motorola E1070 is an attractive clamshell offering plenty of features and the characteristics of the Motorola RAZR model. However, it is thicker. On the other hand, it has conveniences like 3G support, a megapixel camera, a MP3 player and a memory card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main Disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola E1070 is still a relatively unknown model of the famous American manufacturer. In fact, its trivial numeric indication kind of fades among sonorous models likes RAZR, SLVR, ROKR or PEBL. At the same time, in terms of functional equipment, the E1070 model is more of a 'smart' phone rather than a common mobile for the mass. Apparently the lack of a special name can be explained with the design of the phone, which is far too thick to be named after the RAZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola E1070</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case, Motorola E1070 is no boring or ugly device. It is a clamshell of simple lines with a balanced combination of black covers and silver frame. It is not over-rounded. Its technical design is meant to attract male clients rather than female ones. The phone loses in appeal a little bit due to its entire body being made of plastic, but on the other hand this is expected to reduce its price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other words, Motorola E1070 has been designed for all those, who need a clamshell mobile with rich equipment, but are not willing to pay extra for design. By buying this phone you will get a multimedia device with 3G support, but do not expect it to catch people's eyes. It just won't. Experienced customers will definitely notice it, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    It is no trivial clamshell</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device we have tested cannot be considered a final version of the phone. In this review we are going to point out all potential flaws we observed in the phone, but some of them might be fixed in the final version of Motorola E1070. (The original of this review was published on Mobilmania.cz in Nov 2005). </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The testing version of the phone is not the one that will be sold to end users</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile lout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is quite a piece of a phone - this was my first impression of Motorola E1070. It looks pretty robust, even though its dimensions of 96 x 50 x 24 mm are only slightly higher than usual. Anyway, even if eyes may get mislead, hands would not. Motorola E1070 weighs 129 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone is not as big as it seems at first sight</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front cover is black, with its top and bottom edge being in silver. The background plastic material of the front cover is matt, while the square area with a tiny display, a camera, and the manufacturer's logo is glossy and thus is susceptible to finger prints marks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Two types of plastic material on the front cover... ? ...the glossy one is looking forward to your fingerprints &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the device is shorter than the bottom one. That is why there is no standard line of separation at its bottom edge. Instead, the top part goes into the bottom one, just like in RAZR V3. The entire bottom part is made of plastics. The phone's system connector is a classic miniUSB one and is located on the right side of Motorola E1070.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the system connector you will see an square button, which activates the camera application. The memory card slot is situated a bit lower. On the opposite side there is a standard two-way volume-control key and a tiny functional key called "Instant key", which can be assigned any function the user pleases. All side keys are comfortable and work seamlessly. What I am worried about is that they may be much too easy to press in a narrow space like one's pocket, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera release button and miniUSB connector ? memory card slot is protected by a cap that can hardly be lost ? control buttons on the left side of the handset&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The joint of Motorola E1070 is solid. It shows no play. Phone's both parts join softly, without aggressive sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;When closed, the top part does not reach the bottom edge of the device</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is removable. Underneath, there is a lithium-ion battery with 1130 mAh capacity. It is said to provide enough energy for 290 hours on stand-by and 170 minutes of calls. So far I am quite impressed by the battery's durability as it has been three days since I last charged the phone and it's still on. The battery gets fully recharged in approximately two hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back cover and the battery hidden under it ? loud speaker is located beneath the bottom end of the rear cover</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Additional eye<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola E1070 has an extremely fine display, with resolution of 240 x 320 pixels and 262K colors. The display surface is smaller than the one of Motorola RAZR, so its high resolution grips even more. A single square cm accommodates more than 6000 pixels. Lines between the pixels are invisible for the human eye. The technology used is TFT, of course. The display is clear and perfectly visible even under strong daylight. Congratulations, Motorola, well done!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Display is exceptionally fine and good ? it is easy to read even under strong direct daylight</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external display is another story. It is passive, with a pretty low resolution of 96 x 80 pixels, and supports the visualization of 65K colors (unlike the older RAZR, which only supported 4K colors). The external display is pretty useful: it shows time, date and state icons, alerts about missed events. It is able to visualize caller's picture and name and can even be used as a mirror for self-portraits. While listening to music it shows the file name and active ringing profile. The most significant drawback of the outer display is its poor legibility once backlighting goes out. As a consequence, you may easily overlook an important missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   External display is quite legible when backlighting is on ? it remains more or less legible even when backlights are off, as long as a brighter surface reflects in it ? in practice, however, the display is mostly dark and nearly unreadable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's now turn our attention back to the opened phone. In the right corner below the main display there is a tiny VGA camera, which mainly serves for video calls. Apparently, Motorola E1070 supports UMTS 3G networks, along with the three standard GSM bands. You may want to use this internal camera for taking self-portraits for MMS, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The self-portrait camera is so tiny that it may easily remain unnoticed</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Landing runway for the thumb<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you open the phone in a dark room, it will probably be the keypad rather than the display that will catch your attention. The keypad is illuminated in sea-green. The light creates two circles limiting the main navigation key, and two lines dividing the columns of the keypad's numeric part. Keys legends are illuminated in a bit lighter nuance of the same color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thumb will hardly go wrong in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is completely flat. It unites both the functional and the numeric keys. The surface of the keypad constitutes of a thin plastic plate with line parting each key. Keep in mind, however, that parting lines are not really pronounced, which makes touch orientation somewhat difficult. As expected, the keys are set in pretty low, but on the other hand, correct press is confirmed by a moderate click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;Keypad is completely flat. Writing is seamless</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main control element in Motorola E1070 is the four-way navigation key and a confirming central area. Around it there are 7 functional keys - two context ones, a pair of green and red call keys, a correction C key, a web browser access key, and a key for making video calls (logically located above the green receiver button).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Typical Motorola UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola E1070's interface resembles any other Motorola phone interface, keeping on the tradition for several years now. Quite a pity, btw, as the menu structure of Motorola models has often been criticized. Motorola E1070 is no exception to that rule. First of all, let me start with its positive aspects, though. I mean its extensive customizing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Firstly, there is the possibility of placing any wallpaper (animated even) on the main display. Further on, you are given the option to decide what type of clock suits you best - an analog one, a digital one, or none. Operator's name and date can be centered or aligned either to the left or to the right. In the middle of the display you can place the icons of the functions that have been assigned to the four ways of the navigation key. Likewise, the context keys and the side Instant key can be assigned any function, likewise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Various settings of the stand-by display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The style of the main menu is subject to modifications. It can be displayed either as a list, or as a 12-element matrix. You can also determine the order of the menu items. Unfortunately, the phone does not allow the use of number shortcuts for menu navigation. In general, feedback is fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Main menu as a matrix of icons ? main menu as a list with items ? menu organization is a subject to modification</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sub menus are displayed with icons too ? personalization options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Modification of the menu design is possible with graphic themes. Motorola E1070 features three graphic themes, none of them being new. They all look much better thanks to the higher qualities of the display, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Default graphic theme is blue ? there is also a dark one, but what I liked the most was the green graphic theme (see all the rest of the pictures)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And one more detail regarding the display background: the image active on the internal display also appears on the external one. Here however, it is margined by white bars caused by the ratio difference of the two displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Image does not reach display's margins</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola E1070's microphone appears right in front of user's mouth due to the ideal length of the device when opened. The receiver produces clear and distinct sound, yet somewhat silent in noisy environment. Besides, the phone features a Handsfree function, whose acoustic qualities resemble those of the receiver. In other words, its sound is of high-quality but of insufficient volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The earphone above the display is decorated with manufacturer's logo&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing sounds come out from a speaker located in the bottom part of the rear cover. They are quite loud and can represent either a polyphonic melody, or a favorite MP3 file. Sound is a little bit distorted and lacks bass elements, but in no way is it unpleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Selecting ringing profile ? profile setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing sounds can be modified by profiles. The phone offers five ringing profiles to use for changes of ringing melodies and sound alerts. Two of the profiles feature vibration: the first one provides vibration only, while the other one offers simultaneous ringing and vibration. Volume is controlled by the side buttons. Each volume modification is accompanied by a disturbing sound effect typical for Motorola mobiles. Ringing profiles can be changed by using the side buttons, even when the device is closed. In such case, necessary details appear on the external display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Selecting a profile with closed phone</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No chaos in the phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contacts in the phonebook can be viewed in two modes: either as an accurate name list, where each name is accompanied by a tiny icon symbolizing default number (press the green receiver key to dial), or as a contact list, where each contact is displayed together with the default number icon, the number itself, and a mini-image on the left. Use vertical ways to search list contacts and the horizontal ones to browse numbers and emails attached to each contact name. It is possible to send a message or an email to the selected contact directly from the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phonebook as a simple list ? searching a name ? select...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  View with images ? a view at selected contact name</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a first and a last name, a nickname, 7 phone numbers, two email addresses, two web pages, two street addresses, a birth date, a picture and a specific ringing melody. Additional fields can be attached where necessary. What's more, you can even indicate which phone numbers can be video-called and which ones not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; Editing/entering a new contact  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is searched by letter-by-letter typing of name characters. Contacts can be organized into groups. To switch from one group to another press the asterisk or the hash button. Numbers stored on the SIM card form a separate group. Nevertheless, within the general list, they appear along with the contacts saved in the phone memory. Contacts featuring an email address are organized in a separate group as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grouping</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, I am not very positive as to whether voice dialing will be available in the phone. I have not managed to find any voice label insert option. On the other hand, after a press-hold on the green receiver key, the device evidently expects the user to pronounce a name. The phonebook capacity is another mysterious issue. Not only Motorola doesn't provide any details on this matter, but there is no graphic indicator in the phone itself. Considering my experience with former Motorola models, however, I expect the phonebook to fit in at least a thousand of entries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Goofing around with iTap<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola E1070 offers all kinds of conveniences for work with messages. Apart from standard SMS it also manages extended EMS, MMS, and emails. Creating a new message, I was intrigued by the fact that the phone did not ask me the usual question about what type of message I wished to create. The reason why this happens is that Motorola E1070 only disposes of one editor for both text and multimedia messages, which determines message type automatically. This solution is generally quite interesting, but has one crucial disadvantage: if you want to save some money by sending a bunch of text messages as a single MMS, you will need to attach an image or a voice note. Otherwise the message you have created will be recognized as a text one and will be sent as SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editor offers 7 lines for text messages. Countdown starts from a total amount of 3000 characters. The number of written divided SMS is shown shortly before the message is sent. As usual, help is to be found in iTap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Message menu ? writing a SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to write a MMS, simply open the context menu and select "Insert" to attach respective item. You can insert ready pictures, sounds and videos, as well as create new ones. The phone permits you to create sound records only when MMS is to be sent, which is quite interesting. Voice recorder is missing. An example of the somewhat illogical structure of the main menu is the option for creating an independent sound MMS situated somewhere in the very end of the list, below the folders with delivered and sent messages. The number of saved SMS and MMS is only limited by the available shared memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   SMS converted into MMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email messages are created apart. Once in the message menu you need to open the delivered emails folder, where you need to confirm connection to mailbox. Once you have done so, you can view the message list, at the end of which you will find and item called "Create Email". I am writing all this to demonstrate you how complicated operations in Motorola E1070 can sometimes be. On the other hand, however, the phone often offers you more than one way to execute one and the same operations: if you open the main menu and press the left context key, a smaller menu will appear. From here you can create new emails, common messages, and the above mentioned sound messages. The phone works with POP3 and IMAP4 protocols, including SSL, and is able to manage several accounts at a time. Emails can be checked automatically in pre-determined time intervals, or manually. The phone asks you which one of these two ways you prefer every time you open the delivered emails folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Viewing email messages ? reading email ? sending email ? there are plenty of attachment options available</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be instantly replied, or forwarded. Work with multimedia attachments is possible of course. The phone permits you to send several pictures in full megapixel resolution at a time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It plays MP3 without a player?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I cannot help myself but wondering and wondering why Motorola E1070 menu should be so complicated. For example, why does the camera occupy two position in the main menu (once as camera and once as video camera) since the same two icons are to be found on first position in the multimedia folder? Apart from this, I do not get the idea of doubling this application in general as switching from photo camera to video camera is absolutely seamless. The "Airplane mode" function appears twice too. Well, I do understand that such an important function deserves a place in the main menu, but why does it then pop out once again in the submenu...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>"Airplane mode" function deactivates the phone part of the device </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The airplane mode saves plenty of energy and is therefore quite convenient, if you prefer to listen to music. Btw, all Sony Ericsson Walkmans work on the same principle. Yet, where is Motorola E1070's music player? It is not in the multimedia folder, nor is to be found in the rest of the main menu. MP3 could be alternatively played by opening the Sounds folder, but it is not a real music player. So I thought: "The camera is presented by two icons both in the main menu and the multimedia folder. Could one of them be the music player?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I then found out that inside the Sounds folder files resembling fields from the phonebook can be created - to move from one file to another press the asterisk or the hash button. Consequently, these files can be grouped into playlists and filtered by genre. While a playlist is played, you can make use of functions like random play, repeat or Bass Boost. The player can be minimized too. In this case file name appears on the stand-by display. Switching between files is executed by the horizontal presses of the cursor key. Volume is controlled by the respective side buttons. There is no need to mention that the player also works when the device is closed. When you use this option file name will appear on the small external display. To switch between files without opening the phone use the appropriate side button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp; Item with sound files (with My Music playlist being on first position) ? files can be grouped into categories ? music player ? player setup</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So eventually the music player has been found. Unfortunately, I was forced to test it without earphones as the phone delivered to us didn't have any. That is why I am not able to evaluate the quality of the sound output, but I can guarantee that the loud speaker performs pretty well. The Bass Boost function does not have any impact on it, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; The file "Hyperactive" is being played as background; it is possible to play both forward and backward ? played file appears on the external display ? selecting file on the external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, I think that in the final version of the E1070 model Motorola could imply a music java application similar to the one we know from Motorola V360 (such that would allow filtering files by artist and album name). What I have not mentioned yet is music files in Motorola E1070 can occupy a maximum space of 32 MB of internal memory. The phone is equipped with a memory card slot of the MicroSD/TransFlash type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Memory Details</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decorated with a megapixel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola E1070 built-in camera features a megapixel resolution, but its performance is rather average. We can only hope that the final version of the phone is able to take pictures of somewhat better quality. On the other hand, we all know that Motorola has never been famous for making top-class photo mobiles. E1070's camera application features exposure compensation, white balance, zoom, and color effects (applied with the navigation key). Inside the setup menu you can also choose your preferences as to the image resolution, the deactivation of the lens shutter sound, or you can set up the self-release function. The camera has fixed focus lens and no dedicated macro mode, so anything closer than 50 cm is out of focus. The phone does not have a night mode. This is partly substituted by a LED, which is however weak and thus rather useless. The LED can be put to a better use as a small flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Camera viewfinder ? the image featuring a cross indicates which feature can be modified by using the navigation key ? camera settings </paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Motorola E1070 sample photos in full resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Motorola E1070 photos resampled to 800 x 600 pixels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Self-portraits can be made by using either the internal tiny camera and the bigger display, or the better camera and the external display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Active LED ? outer display serves as a mirror</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video mode you can shoot videos in 3GP format. Their quality is rather poor, though, so in practice these may only be used as attachments to go with MMS. It seems that the video recorder (at least in our firmware version) has trouble keeping up with the fast action - you can see this in our second video sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Fast switch between various camera modes ? a bit strange again: video player's detailed properties are set up in the camera setup menu ? folder with videos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Created images or videos are grouped in the same way like sounds are. In other words, you can create folders of your own. To switch between folders use the asterisk and the hash keys. In addition, pictures can be filed into Albums, or sequences of images. These can be slide-showed across the entire display, in a landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; Listing images ? creating a category of one's own ? like My Pictures, for example ? both pictures and videos can be viewed across entire screen</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer, Internet and Extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On first position inside the Tools menu is located the alarm clock. It offers several alarms to activate at various times and with different repeating intervals. The alarm clock can also be used as a "reminder" as it permits text notes. Of course, the reminder function is much better executed by the calendar. Here each event can be assigned a duration time, an alarm, and a repeating interval. As usual, month, week, and day views are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Useful functions menu ? month, week, and day view of the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another pretty interesting function to be found in the extras menu is the calculator featuring an integrated currency converter. Motorola E1070 does not offer time functions, nor does it have pre-installed java games. I suppose that the phone's final version will feature at least a pair of games, though, as it supports 2.0 Java version. Besides, JBenchmark test show that the phone is rather fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internet browser is no less entertaining. It is designed to primarily open WAP pages, which it does brilliantly. 8 text lines are viewed on the display en bloc. The browser is also able to open web pages, but their font size does not get automatically adjusted to the display dimensions, which causes part of the page to remain outside the screen borders. On the other hand, Motorola deserves a compliment for providing connection through internet APN.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Browser copes with WAP pretty well ? not so well with internet pages, though</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the phone is used as a modem, data for the internet browser or for the PC is delivered through GPRS Class 10 or via instant data transfers in UMTS. As to the connection with a PC, this is established through Bluetooth or a USB cable. Bear in mind that Motorola E1070 is equipped with a standard miniUSB connector, which means that the necessary cable will cost you a couple of euros, unless you have already obtained one with your digital camera, for example. Things get a bit more complicated as far as the connectivity software is concerned as it might not be delivered together with the phone. If it is, I expect it to be a demo version only as this is how Motorola has always done so far. Time will tell, though. Motorola may surprise us pleasantly as it already did once by enclosing a full version of its Mobile Phone Tools software into the original package of both the V3 RAZR model and the V635 model. Apart from file transfers, the service software is also able to synchronize data between the phonebook and the calendar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Is it worth it?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola E1070 is a phone for demanding customers, which prefer high-class equipment at moderate price to provocative design. At the same time, Motorola E1070's design seems to me quite attractive and I believe its keypad, for example, would grip the attention of any real style fans. The display is a spectacle for the eyes. Its drawbacks are minor, if any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is a particularly handy working tool due to its well-organized phonebook, calendar, and the option for fast data transfers in 3G. At the same time it is an attractive alternative for all those who require multimedia entertainment, too. The camera application appears to be the weakest link in the entire device. To resume, Motorola E1070 could become a pretty successful mobile as long as the manufacturer fixes its minor drawbacks and encloses fully functional synchronizing software in the original package of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A potential competitor of the new Motorola E1070 is Sony Ericsson K600 - a phone with standard construction, which supports 3G and features equipment pretty similar to the one of E1070. Motorola E1070's advantages are a fine display and a memory card backup, while Sony Ericsson K600 scores on compact design, intuitive menu, radio, and a lower price. On the other hand, here is also the slider phone Nokia 6280, which is more expensive, but its equipment suffers no handicaps, if directly compared to Motorola E1070. Apparently, the most serious competitor of all is going to be Samsung Z300 - a highly attractive clamshell phone, equipped with 3G support, two high-quality displays, an MP3 player, a memory card slot, an extensive phonebook, and a megapixel camera.</paragraph>
