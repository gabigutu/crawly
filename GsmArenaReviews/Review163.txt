			<paragraph>It now comes the time to pay due respect to the smaller makers (in terms of market mostly) that did bring some interesting devices to the MWC 2009. They will get their due coverage of course and our appreciation for having the skill and the courage to stand up to the big guns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It wasn't an easy choice of which brands to include and which to leave out of the article but we had to make it, so there we go. We've got something really exciting to get you started - the Toshiba TG01, one of the best-spec'd WinMo devices we have ever come across.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba TG01<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Toshiba TG01 is a monster of a phone and the giant 4.1" WVGA touchscreen leaves no doubt about that. But it not only looks it, a 1GHz CPU is its wicked beating heart and it's called the Snapdragon. We haven't yet seen a device, let alone one running Windows Mobile, go as high on specs, so hats off to Toshiba for pulling the TG01 out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, right out of the blue, the Toshiba TG01 manages an extremely slim waistline of only 9.9mm. This is quite exceptional and when you see that the device is even slimmer at edges you almost won't believe your eyes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If anyone thought that the battery life was compromised to get such a slim device running on the extremely powerful CPU, they are wrong. The Toshiba TG01 is said to last 11.5 days in standby and 5 hours of talk time, which is just about the same as the HTC Touch Diamond. Now we aren't saying that this is some great achievement but it isn't too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we aren't particularly pleased with is the fact that the device is way too big for single-handed use. The 4.1" screen has definitely crossed the border and two free hands to work with the TG01 are a must. We told you Samsung's Omnia HD wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea in terms of easy handling, and it only has a 3.7-inch screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to the strengths of the TG01, Toshiba have done a nice job customizing the UI of the handset so you don't need to use (or see) the underlying Windows Mobile OS too often. The Toshiba UI is way more practical in terms of bringing a huge number of shortcuts to your home screen, which can then be aligned to the colored stripes thematically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short live demo video of the key features of this new Stripes UI:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a full QWERTY keyboard on screen that can be used in portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another hip feature are the UI accelerometer-based gestures. It's easy - a double shake of the device sideways can do anyone out of 5 available task such as open the phone dialer, end a task, end all tasks, go to the today screen, or simply answer a call. And also double-tapping the device can activate the Task Manager. Sounds pretty nifty, and Toshiba are promising that accidental shake commands are highly unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finger sweep gestures and a large number of customization options improve the user experience even further. You get to pick which stripes (each stripe is responsible for a specific part of the UI - contacts, calendar etc.) appear on you homescreen and what color they are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon quite expectedly has a very positive impact on the Toshiba TG01 performance. The handset is sharp and responsive even at this pre-release stage of development. The display sensitivity is a bit short of the highest standard but we've seen enough of those issues getting fixed with a few tweaks even after the handset has hit the shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device we checked at the Toshiba MWC booth had only one game preinstalled - the Prince of Persia HD. It ran fullscreen with on-screen controls and some impressively looking graphics. Just in case you've missed it in the end of that live video demo up there, here's a screenie.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Garmin-Asus Nuvifone G60 and Nuvifone M20<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last year our trip to the Garmin booth at the Fira de Barcelona was one of the greatest disappointments of the whole event. By that time we were promised that the upccoming Garmin nuvifone G60 a mobile with great GPS-navigation and a smoothly operating touch UI. Instead we got a couple of dummies, and nothing really to write home about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that Garmin have joined forces with Asus things are starting to look a whole lot better. Of course a whole year has passed and the nuvifone G60 risks getting way too late even if it arrives on schedule in Q2 of this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the Linux-based interface is a real looker, easily thumbable and running very fast and smoothly. The Garmin-Asus nuvifone G60 is also equipped with a very sensitive display and is really responsive. The image quality of the widescreen display is also pretty nice with some impressive viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a quick video demo of the UI. It should give you an idea of its layout and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new handset at the Garmin-Asus stand is the Nuvifone M20. Running on Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional this ultra-compact device is still quite far from release at this point and was only showcased behind glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily we managed to get one of those dummies out of its cage for a quick photo session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, the body of the handset looks better than the official photos suggest. However, there is always a possibility for parts of the exterior to be changed before the Nuvifone M20 actually gets going.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also noticed in the screenshots that the M20 will come with some Garmin-Asus home-brewed UI plug-in. It seems nicely thumbable but only after we acquire a more mature unit will we be able to judge its performance. Until then we'll have to do with the bunch of photos we took and hope for the best.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>i-mate introduced only one new device at this year's WMC. However, it's pretty unusual handset by many standards - even military ones, we should add. Known as i-mate 810-F, this Windows Mobile tough phone is strictly up to the rigorous requirements of the American military specs MIL-STD-810 revision F.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A ruggedized WinMo PocketPC with full QWERTY keyboard and a built-in GPS receiver. the i-mate 810-F is well versed in connectivity with quad-band GSM, tri-band 7.2Mbps HSDPA with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0 for local data transfers (A2DP profile supported) .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The i-mate 810-F sports a 2.46 inch QVGA touchscreen and is powered by a 624MHz CPU and 128 MB of RAM. There is no card slot so you'll have to make do with the built-in 2 GB memory. The camera is a no-thrills 2 megapixel fixed-focus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OS is Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional but it's upgradable to 6.5 (when it eventually comes out).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely i-mate left the Windows Mobile user interface quite bare, even though they released their touch-friendly i-mate Go UI a couple of months ago. i-mate have at least provided the device with their proprietary security system Secure i-Q that allows for remote lockdown and remote wipe should the device be stolen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here's the bit that may be of interest to cave divers in the Arctic region that feel the need to bring their PowerPoint presentations with them. The i-mate 810-F was designed around its namesake military standard, which means that the phone will operate in the temperature range of -10 to +60C, can be fully submerged under water, and it's shock resistant as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, those of you who were thinking of Rambo-level toughness are probably a bit disappointed but keep in mind that this is a capable PocketPC, and rugged PocketPCs usually are the size of an average family car. Many phones claim compliance with the 810 standard (Sonim's XP phones and Verizon's G'zOne Type-V to name a few) but they are usually feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>i-mate are so sure of the toughness of the 810-F that they even offer a conditional lifetime warranty - if it breaks, they'll replace it. Here's a short torture test we took at the i-mate stand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, despite all the toughness you get, the i-mate 810-F is among the ugliest devices presented at the MWC 2009.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>i-Mate also presented a dummy version of the i-mate Centurion - a QWERTY-enabled WinMo smartphone, which however is no bigger than a credt card. The Centurion is still just a codename, and as it seems i-mate are only teasing the public with its appearance at the MWC 2009. An actual working device will be presented this summer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Centurion has a full QWERTY keyboard and packs 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Gigabyte had a really nice booth this year at the MWC and they also has some interesting devices to show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, the MWC 2009 met the official announcement of the Giga-byte g-Smart S1200 - a brand new Windows Mobile 6.1 device that's only 11.4mm thick but doesn't skimp on specifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also saw a well forgotten PocketPC called MS820 that was announced at last year's Computex, back when it was probably the first PocketPC to have a 5 megapixel camera and definitely the first to offer face detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides those two, Gigabyte also showcased two of their future devices that seemed quite bold and high-tech given the current market situation. The g-Smart S1204 is an 8 megapixel PocketPC with a waist of only 12mm. Based on Windows Mobile 6.5, it has a 3.1-inch touchscreen display plus GPS and Wi-Fi - and it looks the part indeed! The g-Smart S1224 is a 3 megapixel PocketPC, which sports DVB-H and DVB-T dupport along with GPS and Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides a Qualcomm 528Mhz CPU, 128MB RAM, GPS and Wi-Fi, the g-Smart S1200 has full HSPA support, a 3.1-inch touchscreen display and a 1010 mAh battery - and we are talking HTC Diamond big (or rather, small).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gigabyte g-Smart S1200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte announcements at MWC 2009 featured the g-Smart S1200 in their focus as the major product of the company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the g-Smart S1200 runs on Windows Mobile 6.1 but Gigabyte are promising an upgrade will be offered once Windows Mobile 6.5 is officially out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S1200 is based on the well-known Qialcomm MSM7200A platform that gives it aa 528MHz CPU, 128MB RAM, a GPS receiver and Wi-Fi connectivity. Quite sufficient we would add. The 3 megapixel camera on board the device may not sound attractive, but you've got to remember that the g-Smart S1200 has a thickness of only 11.4mm, which is quite impressive for a WinMo PocketPC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the 3.1-inch WVGA display you will find another surprise by Gigabyte - their latest thumbable user interface SmartZone, which is fully based on Flash and covers the underlying OS pretty completely. Even the Start menu has gone missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video showing what the new SmartZone interface looks like in reality:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gigabyte g-Smart MS820<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte g-Smart MS820 definitely looks like an older generation device, which it is, as it was first showcased in June 2008 at last year's Computex 2008.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MS820 is exactly what the WinMo PocketPC looked like before the HTC Touch Diamond changed the game - big and bulky. While it's relevantly secured on the specifications front, its looks definitively don't do it any good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main features of the MS820 include a 2.8-inch VGA screen, a 520Mhz Marvel CPU, 128MB RAM, GPS, Wi-Fi and an accelerometer. The most impressive part of the spec sheet is the 5 megapixel AF camera with face detection, which was the world's first back in June 2008 when the device was first showcased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From what we saw at Gigabyte booth this year, the MS820 runs on an older version of the home UI and if we were you looking at an MS820 as a prospective buy, well, we'd look elsewhere. The g-Smart S1200 looks and feels way better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gigabyte g-Smart S1204 and S1224<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, Gigabyte had something else in store for us - the Gigabyte S1204 and the S1224 which were rather impressive gadgets, though at a quite an early stage of development.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte g-Smart S1204 has a 3.1-inch touchscreen display with the impressive WVGA resolution, but the goodies are far from over. The 8 megapixel AF camera is currently a world's first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S1204 also has an accelerometer, TV-out and a 1250mAh battery, which is impressive given the tight girth. The S1204 is only 12.1mm thick and runs on a Qualcomm MSM7200A 528MHz CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile 6.5 is in charge on board the S1204, but there's the clever new Flash-based g-Smart UI on top of it to improve usability. At the time we saw it however, it was behind glass displaying the home screen of an early beta of Windows Mobile 6.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to a technical glitch, we cannot show you our own photos of the S1204, so we'll use ones borrowed from JournalduGeek.com and MobileArena.hu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte g-Smart S1224 is the last of the Gigabyte phones we checked out at the MWC 2009. With a stylish brushed metal finish, the S1224 is again 12.1mm slim, but offers DVB-H as well as DVB-T mobile TV support along with GPS, Wi-Fi, and a 3 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you'll notice we spent more time with the S1224 and it certainly deserved it, although it was a non-functioning device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At this year's MWC Motorola once again failed to grab the attention of the public. Their nicely made booth was in fact a home of rather various devices that didn't exactly qualify as novel. To cut the long story short, Motorola didn't present any new phones at the MWC 2009.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we rarely see much of the once top manufacturer, we decided to go through a couple of their devices that we hadn't seen in person before. The first one is the Motorola A3100, also known by its codename Atilla, along with the Motorola Aura - an exclusive extra expensive device meant for the rich and famous.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola A3100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola A3100, also known as Atilla, is the first keyboard-less Windows Mobile device by the company. It's an iPhone-sized device with a 2.8-inch QVGA-only screen, Wi-Fi, GPS and a 3 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Externally, perhaps the most attractive feature of the A3100 is the brushed metal back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main method of navigating throughout the interface (besides the obvious touching of course) is the trackball just below the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola A3100 runs on a vanilla Windows Mobile 6.1 with a basic home screen interface consisting of various tabs scrolling across the screen sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've basically got a Today screen with a scoop of messages and appointments, but you can easily scroll to check weather information in selected cities. There's also a quick-dial Contacts screen, an application launcher and a fullscreen RSS reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Motorola A3100 lacks any wow-factor and probably only die-hard WinMo fans will be attracted to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Aura<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If there's anything that the Motorola Aura certainly has it's an aura of extravagance and exclusivity. Sporting the world's first Swiss-made opening mechanism, a unique circular display and interface and finally, an all-metallic body, the Aura of Motorola has certainly got the killer looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening mechanism of the upper part of the rotation cover of the Aura has some really interesting design logic. The opening movement is assisted, so you can easily open it up single-handedly, however closing requires some extra effort. Opening the cover works in either direction, however you have to close it going in the opposite direction of the one you chose for opening it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mechanism behind the whole thing seems quite exquisitely exposed through the special port hole on the back of the phone. Reportedly, it takes a whole week to assemble the whole upper cover with all the tidbits and that makes the 2000 US dollars price a bit more understandable, but not a notch easier to swallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were really interested in the circular user interface developed especially for the Motorola AURA. It ticks quite fast with excellent responsiveness. Unfortunately, the D-pad seemed a bit small for comfortable clicking through the menu icons. nevertheless, the UI graphics are extra nice and make really nice use of the unorthodox screen form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Aura have been announced for quite some time now but Motorola have decided to officially pimp it up with a set of approximately 90 brilliant cut diamonds set around the display amounting to a total of 1 karat. You can even pick the colors of the diamonds to match your wishes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Motorola Aura Diamoniqe is an exclusively limited edition with only 50 units made. It's styled by luxury designer Alexander Amosu, known for making a diamond Blackberry Bold, diamond iPhone, diamond iPod Touch, diamond Nokia N95 or even diamond Canon IXUS 80IS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Aura Diamoniqe comes with one year free international concierge service in 44 cities around the world and will set you back a good 5000 GBP - and that's without the delivery cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if that is a bit too much for you, Alexander Amosu and Motorola have teamed up for a Gold edition of the Motorola Aura, which comes slightly more cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gold-plated with 24-carat gold, the Motorola Aura Gold can be yours for "only" 2000 GBP, which is less than half of what you would pay for the Aura Diamoniqe. Plus you get to choose out of rose, yellow, pink and rhodium black gold.</paragraph>
