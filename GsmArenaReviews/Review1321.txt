			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tablets are killing netbooks, pundits say, and all gadget makers are jumping on the bandwagon. LG, it seemed, were in no particular hurry but now that their Optimus Pad is here, it shows they mean business. The 8.9" tablet is powered by Tegra 2 and adds a bit of stereoscopic 3D for a dash of excitement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, the LG Optimus Pad is a beast. Other tablets lose out on quite a few specs. The Optimus Pad is powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 2 chipset, which is the norm for droid tablets, as is Android Honeycomb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>5MP cameras are fairly rare though, dual-5MP cameras even harder to find. And they'll record 1080p in 2D mode when most others stop at 720p. And there?s 720p 3D video capture. The 2MP front-facing camera promises solid video calling experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, a standard miniHDMI port will sure save some adapter-related headaches. There's USB On-The-Go too, with a cable for that and a miniHDMI cable both included in the bundle. The LG Optimus Pad has the richest tablet package we've seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Optimus Pad has a few more tricks than your average tablet. Here's the summary, along with the downsides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad and Optimus 3D are leading LG's charge into mobile stereoscopic imaging. Unlike the phone however, the Pad doesn?t have a goggle-free screen - it uses anaglyph glasses (unfortunately, there aren?t any to be found in the box), which spoils the viewing experience somewhat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the Optimus Pad is capable of playing 3D over HDMI, which can quickly turn it into your 3D movie player of choice. And if you don't have a 3D TV, you can use the same anaglyph glasses you use with the Pad itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next on the Optimus Pad channel is unboxing, followed by The Screen Show and General hardware overview, Season 2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the LG Optimus Pad is fairly rich. You get the basics such as a charger (the size of a laptop charger), a microUSB cable and some manuals. You also get niceties like a USB On-The-Go cable and a miniHDMI cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the richest tablet box we've seen so far. Now, anaglyph glasses are said to be part of the standard package, but our box came without them even though we have a retail product fresh off the street. It's a good idea to check that before buying your Pad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pixel-rich screen suffers outdoors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad has an 8.9" screen at 1280 x 768, which means a pixel density of 167ppi. That?s higher than the iPad, the Motorola XOOM and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 - enough for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a plain TFT unit though (not IPS, that is), and viewing angles are a little limited. Contrast deteriorates the further you move away from the dead-on angle, but overall the screen holds up very well. It's much better than what we experienced in the preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is the display's weak spot. On a sunny day, it's very hard to see anything on the screen, which isn't helped by how reflective the screen is. Outdoors, you'll struggle to hit a good viewing angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our display test table follows, to pit the LG Optimus Pad against some of the competing screens we?ve tested. The brightness results are pretty uniform across the sample of tablets, but the Optimus Pad comes out ahead by a whisker. The black pixels leak quite a bit of light, so contrast readings are not very impressive (still, a little better than the iPad 2 though).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad looks for a design identity in the more recent batch of Optimus line smartphones. It may not be quite the classy stone-cold looker that the Motorola XOOM is, but it's not ugly by any means. In fact the LG tablet looks a bit better than the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9, which is the only other 8.9" droid slate at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the device has only a few things besides the screen itself: the 2MP front facing camera, an ambient light sensor and a small status LED. The typical Android keys have been moved to the screen as is the case with other Honeycomb tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's talk about the equipment on the sides of the Optimus Pad. Assuming "top" is where the LG logo is, on the top of the device you'll find the charger plug, the 3.5mm audio jack and one of the loudspeaker grills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is the Power/Lock key, which is small and almost flush against the top of the Optimus Pad. It's comfortable to use and accidental presses are unlikely. Also, when you hold the tablet horizontally, the Power/Lock key goes on the left side and it's still alright to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the tablet (or bottom when held horizontally) houses the microUSB port (you can't charge the Optimus Pad with it, even with a microUSB charger) and the miniHDMI port, both of which are left uncovered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side houses the volume rocker and the microphone which comes up on the top side of the tablet when you hold it horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the tablet is home to two loudspeakers, which pushes the total to three. There's a good reason for that - if you hold the Optimus Pad upright (with the logo on top), it?s the two loudspeakers that play. But if you hold the Pad horizontally, only one of the two at the bottom remains active and it couples with the third loudspeaker on the far side of the tablet for better stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the tablet is the more intriguing place. There we find the dual 5 MP camera lenses, fitted with a single LED flash. The lenses are symmetrically placed either side of a brushed metal strip - an accent found on recent Optimus smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the two cameras protrude quite a bit so the tablet ends up resting on them when you place it on a table. You need to take care, as that exposes them to scratches. Also, there's nothing to stop fingerprint smudges on the camera lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can slide to open a tiny bit at the top to access the SIM compartment. There is no microSD card slot on the Optimus Pad, 32GB of inbuilt storage is all you get. The battery, as you might expect, is not user accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6400mAh battery is quoted at up to 9 hours and 20 minutes of calls or 273h of standby time. We also ran the browser battery test and compared the results to other tablets we've tested. The LG Optimus Pad came close to the other Android tablet we've tested, the Motorola XOOM, but both are two hours behind the Apple iPad 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, just over 7 hours of constant (and we do mean constant, the test script moves through pages faster than most people would) is enough to last you the whole day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad is a well-built device and we found an 8.9" screen to be very welcoming. The matte, rubbery finish on the back is quite pleasant to touch and great at hiding fingerprints. The brushed metal strip in the center is a nod at Optimus smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the problem of the Optimus Pad is weight. At more or less the same size as its Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9, the LG tablet is a whole 150g heavier, which is a smartphone's worth of weight, even a bit more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Honeycomb is in charge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad runs an unmodified version of Android 3.0.1 Honeycomb, which makes it virtually identical to some of the competing devices. The tablet version of Android is powerful enough to handle almost anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 3 Honeycomb offers a resized user interface to make best use of all the available resolution and screen real estate. The hardware buttons have been replaced with on-screen controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home and Back buttons are in the lower left corner, with a dedicated Task Switcher key right next to them. In part, this is perhaps a move to emphasize the multitasking abilities of Honeycomb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search key has been placed in the top left corner, while the app launcher is now accessed via a button at the top right. Next to it, there?s another dedicated button that the smartphone-friendly Android versions lack ? homescreen edit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come upon the status icons, which are in the lower right corner. Tapping on any of them will open the notification pop-up. In Honeycomb the notification area doesn?t take the entire screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a shortcut to settings. It is more of a replacement of the connectivity switches that you find in some Android smartphones (such as the Samsung TouchWiz droids), than the real settings menu, which is accessible through the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen has also been modified to make better use of the bigger screen. In edit mode you get all five homescreen panes on top with four tabs available at the bottom: widgets, apps, wallpapers and ?more?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way you can grab a widget from the bottom tab and drag it to the desired homescreen pane on top. With smartphones you need to scroll if you want to place a widget on any other screen but the currently selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has seen some changes too ? it?s now split in two tabs ? All and Downloaded. The first one contains all the available apps, while the second one holds those installed by you. A press and hold on any of them will make the five homescreen panes appear so you can place a shortcut on whichever you might need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, we are pretty pleased with the usability of the Honeycomb interface. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into its design and it really is a notch above the competition in terms of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Optimus Pad did well in terms of handling, though using live wallpaper did cause a lag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the benchmarks for the number-crunchers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contacts: phones but no calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is fairly straightforward on the LG Optimus Pad. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger screen has allowed some modifications that reduce the needed clicks for some tasks and thus improve usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You now get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field on top as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or editing the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Optimus Pad has no telephony, clicking a phone number opens the messaging app and tapping an email address or a website automatically launches the email app or the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is not the best-looking part of the contact management on the Optimus pad, but at least it?s easy to use. You get the available fields organized in groups, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a filed that hasn?t existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom filed names aren?t available at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the Optimus Pad results from our traditional loudspeaker test. The device did pretty bad getting a really low below average mark, that may disappoint some users. You can find more about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the messaging app above. It is pretty simple and lets you send texts to one or more recipients. MMS are not enabled, it's just a simple SMS composer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Split-screen email clients<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad comes with two optimized email applications out of the box ? one for your Gmail and one to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single email the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and check mail manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s basically the treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few optimizations permitted by the large screen and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Now this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won?t notice any big difference when handling short emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s auto correction and auto capitalization available and you can enable sounds on key presses. There?s no haptic feedback so it?s not perfect just yet, but the overall experience is pretty decent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Honeycomb image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of functionality but it has too been tweaked to feel more comfortable on the large screen. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper right corner holds shortcuts to the camera, image details or extra settings (like make available offline for Picasa albums).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are browsing a specific album/date/location/tag the shortcuts change a bit ? the extra settings shortcut is replaced by a button that starts a slide show. The icon in the very top left corner becomes active and clicking it brings you back to the full gallery view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Optimus Pad gallery has the same issue as most of its smartphone siblings ? it doesn?t show you full size images, but downsized versions instead. This means that you cannot see all the detail on a photo on the tablet itself, which is a pity, given the excellent picture browsing potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To end the gallery overview on a positive note we?ll mention a cool accelerometer-based trick. In the default view, albums with more than one photo inside have a cool 3D shadow effect when you tilt the slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A music player to like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad music player has a visually appealing interface and lets you sort your tracks by album, artist, song, genre, playlist or just bring the new and recent additions on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, there?s also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) you get the familiar split screen interface. Album art, which is naturally supported, appears on the left along with the playlist details. The track list goes on the right and the currently playing track (if any) appears at the bottom with quick controls available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen offers shuffle and repeat (including repeat one) functionality, but no equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background, a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name. There are also quick pause and skip controls right there so you don?t need to open the music player every time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD video playback, lack of codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the large screen and enviable processing power, the LG Optimus Pad doesn?t make for much of a portable video player. And you can tell that right from the start as the thing doesn?t even have a dedicated video player app - everything is in the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the player handles MP4 videos up to 1080p. You have to be careful with the bitrate though, because higher bitrate 1080p videos might end up choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The codec support is also seemingly a few years old with DivX and XviD nowhere in sight. You will have to either get a third-party app for playing those, which will inevitably harm performance or convert all your videos before uploading them to the Optimus Pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully, the Optimus Pad has Mass Storage mode supported, unlike the Motorola XOOM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output as good as you'd expect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you would expect from a device this size, the LG Optimus Pad offers nice and clean audio output. Save for the iPad, it could match or beat just about every other slate out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In collaboration with an active external amplifier the Optimus Pad produces perfectly clean output and pretty high volume levels. As you can see from the scores below, there's not a single weak part of its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there's not too much degradation with headphones in the picture either, except for the volume levels, which take a plunge. Stereo crosstalk does increase, but it's still better than most of the devices we have tested (including the iPad). In fact, if it wasn't for the only average volume level in this scenario, the Optimus Pad might have successfully challanged the title in this category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel stills and Full HD video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a pair of 3D-enabled 5 megapixel cameras and a 2 megapixel front-facing unit, the LG Optimus Pad is unmatched for imaging skills among tablets. However, shooting with a tablet is hardly the most comfortable thing so we wonder how high Full HD video and 720p 3D clips will rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad's camera interface is quite simple. You get flash settings, white balance, color effects and scenes on a convenient dial as well as resolution settings, picture quality, focus mode and exposure compensation in the extra settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also shortcuts for switching between the two cameras and toggling camcorder and still camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re more than pleased with the image quality. The amount of resolved detail is excellent, the colors quite pleasant. The only thing we noticed is the low contrast on some photos, but nothing to ruin your images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Photo Compare Tool proves that the LG Optimus Pad is a better performer than the Motorola XOOM and other 5 megapixel droids.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad is capable of recording videos up to 1080p. There aren?t too many settings available to the user: LED as video light, white balance, color effects, video quality and time-lapse interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The captured videos also turned out quite decent. We noticed a few dropped frames and the contrast is also a bit low as the stills, but the colors and the captured detail are very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s an untouched video sample taken straight from the Optimus Pad camera for you to enjoy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here you can see how the Optimus Pad compares to other tablets and smartphones for video quality. The Optimus Pad video quality is on par or better compared to most of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here on the video compare you can notice some strange video defect - a blue line at the top of the videos. Our preview unit didn?t have it, so we guess it is a software issue and should be fixed with the next firmware update.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D camcorder and 3D video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Optimus Pad is not capable of taking 3D still images - it has the hardware, but LG didn't provide the software. Still, there is a 3D camcorder capable of shooting 720p 3D videos and a 3D video player to enjoy them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder offers very few options. You get to choose the 3D viewing mode: anaglyph, mixed, single or side-by-side. Generally, you will have the viewfinder in anaglyph mode with 3D glasses, but it's good to see you have options here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set the 3D depth (be careful with that), choose the video quality, set the white balance and turn the audio recording on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come some samples from the LG Optimus Pad camcorder. It's not the best 720p footage quality we've seen, but you will hardly notice it when watching it in 3D with or without glasses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an untouched 720p video sample for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the samples in 3D, you have to use the integrated LG 3D video player. The interface is rather simple and you have just one option - view the video in anaglyph mode or side by side. You need a standard pair of anaglyph glasses to watch the 3D content. These were not supplied with our unit, so we guess their availability is region-dependent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We uploaded the Optimus Pad 3D videos onto an Optimus 3D smartphone and they are fully compatible. We watched them in 3D without glasses trouble free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad is well equipped in terms of connectivity. You get standard microUSB complete with USB host functionality. Unfortunately, you won?t be able to use it before the expected Android 3.1 Honeycomb update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG chose not to enable charging off USB either, so you will need to keep the proprietary charger at hand at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you get Wi-Fi and GPS radios plus 3G speeds of up to 10.2 Mbps HSDPA and 2 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no microSD card slot. The 32GB of internal storage is plentiful and Mass Storage is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity options worth mentioning are Bluetooth (with file transfer support) and the microHDMI port that allows high definition TV-out without an adapter. Luckily, LG has supplied an HDMI cable within the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 3.0 Honeycomb's browser is great, but for better Flash performance you need 3.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. With full Flash support, the Optimus Pad gets an edge over the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser. The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field - typical Android - which scores another point for the Optimus Pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks have their own screen and history uses a split-screen interface letting you check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There?s also a most visited tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn?t need any extra software ? you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also auto-complete for forms and passwords and you can pick the default zoom level for the browser. Not that altering the zoom is that hard with pinch-zoom, naturally, being supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though so you have to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for the Flash performance ? the Optimus Pad does okay at 360p videos right in the browser and 480p are watchable too (even if they do get slightly choppy at times). 720p Flash videos on the other hand are completely out of the question, though early reports suggest that the Android 3.1 update upgrades them to only mildly choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And this might have sounded good if it wasn?t for the fact that some Android smartphones are already doing 720p Flash and the Galaxy S II even manages 1080p. Obviously LG (or NVIDIA, we are not quite sure here) still has some catching up to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, if you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause stutter when panning, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off all together).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A good set of organizer apps are available on the Optimus Pad, including the Polaris Office that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you think of organizer features on a smartphone (or tablet) the first app that comes to mind is the calendar. It has five different types of view: daily, weekly and monthly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app on the Optimus Pad features an alarm clock. It is optimized for big-screen use and is pretty intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can naturally set as many alarms as you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market on a big screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The additional applications are the heart of every modern mobile platform. The more and the higher-quality they are the better the market prospects of their OS. For the Optimus Pad this is a two-sided tale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a customized Android market interface that lets you browse and search the hundreds of thousands of apps quicker than ever before. The productivity is probably the best there is on the market and gaming is second only to the App store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand though, only a handful of those apps are actually optimized for the Optimus Pad. WVGA ones aren?t too pixelated but they are not perfectly sharp either. As to those meant for lower resolution ? you need not bother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is really a mixed bag with quite a lot of the apps we installed suffering puzzling lags. We are speaking of apps that run fine on single-core WVGA handsets and that we would?ve assumed to be a walk in the park for the Optimus Pad. Obviously, there?s some more optimization needed before the Optimus Pad can really enjoy the same kind of freedom as its smartphone siblings.It may not even be the Pad that?s to blame, we had the same issues with the Motorola Xoom too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s good to be a tablet these days. But it?s hard to rise above the rest. Honeycomb, Tegra dual-core and pretty much standard screen resolution, makers need to go to great lengths to make their slates stand out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad seems to have more reasons than usual to call itself special. A pretty capable 5MP camera (actually two of them) and 1080p videos bolster its imaging credentials. The connectivity package is above the average too, with a standard miniHDMI port and USB On-The-Go. It?s a well-accessorized gadget too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then there?s 3D. If nothing else, it feeds the hype machine and gives the Pad an extra leg to stand on. In fairness, the 3D stills turned out to be disabled, and the mandatory 3D glasses were not supplied with our unit. Not to mention, photo and video don?t usually top the bill for tablet users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, 3D may be a joke for some (can?t blame them at this point) while others may find use for it in the right environment. In a wider context with 3D smartphones and TVs, the Optimus Pad may actually prove relevant. Just like the HDMI port is more than a mere line in the spec sheet if you think a 3D-enabled TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D stuff aside, the Optimus Pad is pretty much like the lot: unskinned Android Honeycomb, 32GB of internal storage, Tegra 2 chipset and rich connectivity options. We?re less than impressed with the screen, but it?s got nothing to do with the resolution or size. In fact, at 8.9? the Optimus Pad hits the sweet spot between performance and portability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the screen size that leaves no doubt about the main rival. The Galaxy Tab 8.9 is still to be released but perhaps it doesn?t mind coming late as long as it comes prepared. If Samsung?s tablet gets released with Honeycomb 3.1, the tables may turn. In terms of features, the choice between the two Korean tablets is one between telephony and a memory card slot (Samsung) and 3D imaging (LG). We however think that the real decider will be size and weight. The super slim and lightweight Galaxy Tab 8.9 is in no mood to fool around when it comes to the key feature of tablets, portability.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM was the first tablet to the market to run Honeycomb and one that?s certain to get a boost from Honeycomb 3.1. The XOOM is a well featured tablet, matching the Optimus Pad spec for spec down to the HDMI port. It?s got a microSD slot too but obviously none of the Optimus Pad?s 3D trickery. The XOOM was released with a hefty price tag but it?s now significantly cheaper than the Optimus Pad.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Speaking of it, budget-conscious users are not without options. The EeePad Transformer by Asus is one. It brings a 10.1? LED-backlit IPS LCD display with scratch protection, a memory card slot, Waveshare UI and an optional keyboard dock. Not to mention the lower price.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The 3G-capable Acer Iconia Tab A501 also features a microSD card slot. The Iconia Tab A501 was released in April and its 32GB version is cheaper than the Optimus Pad.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So, there?re cheaper and better-looking alternatives, bigger screens and better screens, custom interfaces. These are more or less subtle differences ? performance and productivity are quite similar. A unique ability helps the Optimus Pad stand out but it pushes the price up. The 3D technology creates a habitat for the Optimus Pad to exist. But it?s still a species that needs to evolve to earn its own place in this ecosystem.</paragraph>
