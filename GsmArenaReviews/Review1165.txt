		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>According to recent estimates Nokia's smartphone sales could really use a boost. The Finns are putting most of their hopes on the WP flagship Lumia 900 and the Symbian 808 PureView cameraphone, but the one we're about to review might come in quite handy too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 is a simple phone with a simple goal: make the Windows Phone experience even more accessible. This basic smartphone is priced to not gather dust on the shelves and you can guess the features aren't exactly top notch. But this is where the Lumia 610 is perhaps more fortunate than its expensive siblings. It must be harder for the likes of the Lumia 800 and Lumia 900 to get away with some of the platform's limitations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 610 looks a lot like the 710 on the outside, but has less-capable hardware inside. Now, that means even tighter limits on what the phone can do but it's an entry-level smartphone after all. Focusing on what you get rather than on what's missing is the right attitude in this price range. And that's exactly what we're going to do in the following lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The long list of cons might ring a lot of bells and, if you are familiar with the Windows Phone OS you already know most of them are platform-wide limitations. On the other hand, familiarity with the OS most probably takes you off the list of potential Lumia 610 targets. It's rather a beginner's smartphone, one that will introduce you to WP7 if you're ready to move on from feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users with no smartphone experience are less likely to be concerned about the amount of RAM. In fact, people with some experience with older Symbian will see nothing wrong with 256MB. What it actually means is there's no HD video recording and playback. Some apps, like Skype and Angry Birds will not run due to insufficient memory, but you should be getting the same solid set of features for the most part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Lumia 610 offers is a low-cost Windows Phone experience. It seems perfectly suited for emerging markets, where Nokia should have built a strong customer base of potential first-time smartphone users by now. Carriers on the old continent will most certainly be interested in the Lumia 610, too, and if you think an entry-level Windows smartphone is worth a look, this review will hopefully help you know it better. We start with the hardware right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Lumia 610<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The plain cardboard box of the Nokia Lumia 610 is fairly big but it doesn't carry much more than the basics. There's a charger head to be used with the supplied microUSB cable, a headset of reasonably good quality and several printed guides.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 610 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 measures are almost identical to those of the Lumia 710 at 119 x 62 x 12 mm and its 133 g weight strikes a good balance between carrying comfort and nice solid feel. The shape and hand feel are quite similar too. The easiest way to tell them apart is the set of controls beneath the screen. The Lumia 710 has hardware buttons on a single rocker-styled piece, while the 610 goes for three separate capacitive keys.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Based on the Lumia 710's body, the Nokia Lumia 610 uses a different finish and the asymmetrically fitting front and back create a hint of a chin below the screen. There are some differences in the location of controls and connectivity ports too. The Lumia 710 has the power/lock key at the top while in the Lumia 610 it's on a side, Symbian style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the Lumia 610 has a faint resemblance to Symbian smartphones, the Nokia C7 in particular should ring a bell. It's an all-plastic handset but, while it looks well put together, the quality of the finish could've been better. The rubbery plastic at the rear is easily smudged and fingerprints are a big issue up front on the screen too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A glossy chrome-like frame runs along the sides and extends to the phone's top, housing all the controls and ports. The Lumia 610 is available in the traditional color versions for the series: cyan, magenta, white and black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 has a standard issue LCD screen of WVGA resolution. AMOLED is clearly out of the Lumia 610's league and even a Nokia ClearBlack display (Lumia 710) would've been way over budget. Overall, the Nokia 610 has to make do with a typical Widows Phone screen. The 3.7" diagonal translates into a pixel density of 252ppi, which is OK, considering WVGA is stretched quite thin on bigger screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast could've been better though and the Metro UI that we quite like doesn't look its best. The poor sunlight legibility was an unpleasant surprise. The highly reflective display is nearly unusable outdoors on bright sunny days, so untypical of Nokia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Lumia 610 stacks up against the competition. You can learn more about the testing process over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We zoomed into the display using our digital microscope so you can get a better idea of how the pixels are arranged, and how big they are. Check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Nokia Lumia 610 display matrix compared to the Xperia U matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard set of Windows Phone controls are below the screen and they're all capacitive this time around, compared to the regular press buttons of the Lumia 710. The Back, Home and Search keys, left to right, are well spaced and sufficiently far from the bottom edge to allow comfortable single-hand operation. The usual extra functionality upon a press-and-hold is enabled. A long press of the Back key launches the task switcher, while tapping and holding the Home key activates voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is right on the border between the chrome frame and the rubbery chin, just below the capacitive keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you'll spot the earpiece and a proximity sensor, just right of the Nokia logo. There is no front-facing camera on the Lumia 710, and no ambient light sensor either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Lumia 610 features a volume rocker, a tiny lock/power button and a shutter key. The latter is soft and responsive, with distinct half-press for auto-focus, and will power up the camera upon a long press even when the phone is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is completely bare. There is nothing at the bottom either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy top of the Lumia 610 has the 3.5mm audio jack, a microUSB port and a secondary microphone pinhole. There's a lanyard eyelet as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610's battery cover has soft rubbery finish for extra grip. The 5MP camera lens and the LED flash are near the top, with the loudspeaker grille at the bottom, which is the same layout as the Lumia 710.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may want to occasionally open the battery cover and clean the lens protection glass on the inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover you'll see the microSIM card slot within the battery compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its modest 1300 mAh battery, the Nokia Lumia 610 achieved an endurance rating of 43 hours in our battery test, which surprised us nicely. It managed some pretty impressive scores in the individual tests too, suggesting that Windows Phone 7.5 Refresh has brought some tweaks to battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 610 handles nicely and single-hand operation is trouble-free. Using the 710 blueprints, Nokia have done a good job of giving the Lumia 610 its own distinct look and character. It's a well-built phone with a grippy back and a solid feel in the hand. There're no massive gaps between joining parts and nothing that looks particularly vulnerable. The finish could've been of higher quality - and we mostly mean it should have been less fingerprint-prone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone in power-saving mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 runs Windows Phone 7.5 Refresh. The latest release was revealed at this year's MWC in Barcelona under the codename Tango and should be on all second-gen WP7 smartphones already. The very point of this update, barring some minor added features, was to allow the OS to run on less powerful hardware. The 1GHz CPU and 512MB RAM threshold has been lowered and the Lumia 610 does reasonably well with an 800MHz processor and 256MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it cannot do is run some memory-intensive apps, like Skype (upon trying to install it off the marketplace, you get a "not available" warning). HD recording and playback are missing too. App backgrounding has been disabled, but that doesn't mean an end to multitasking - the WP7 version of it anyway. Quick switching between apps is supported, and so are push notifications and live-tile updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is almost impossible to tell WP7 smartphones apart by looking at the interface. The simple but effective two-page homescreen does not lend itself to customizations the way Android does. In the Windows phone ecosystem, the difference comes from the preloaded software, which is one of the highlights of the Nokia Lumia 610.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin, here's a demo video of the Nokia Lumia 610 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a vertical grid of Live tiles that can be reordered the way you like. Practically any app can be placed in the grid by holding your finger over it and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a clean and simple interface. The Live tile of each app shows info relevant to the app's function - stuff such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's a bit oversimplifying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, a thing we really like about Windows Phone is that you can wake the phone and jump straight into the camera by pressing and holding the camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access all installed apps by going into the application list - which is a swipe away from the Live tiles. Apps are alphabetically sorted there and you have a virtual Search button to easily locate apps if you have many of those installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 610 goes about multitasking like every other WP7 smartphone. It's not true multitasking; things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. The app switcher itself looks similar to that of WebOS or a bit like Android on Sense UI: thumbnails of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to exactly how you left it. It's never more than the last 5 apps,- the one on top is always the start screen. You can't "kill" any of those apps, this is more of a history of the recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, as you open more apps, the older ones start to drop out of the list. Once an app is gone, you have to launch it again the old-fashioned way, which means you'll need to start over. However, the browser for example will still load the last visited page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 runs on a Qualcomm MSM7227A Snapdragon chipset featuring a single-core processor, clocked at 800 MHz,and the Adreno 200 GPU, coupled with the lowly 256 MB RAM. It's obvious that you can't expect miracles in terms of performance, but you are probably wondering how much difference the dated hardware makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider tests the JavaScript performance of the handsets, but with the three selected devices running the same OS with the same browser and JavaScript engines the difference in their performance is all down to the CPU speed. No wonder then, that the Lumia 610 falls behind its bigger brother the 710 and the Samsung Omnia W.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark adds HTML5 to the equation, but hardly changes the picture. The result of the Nokia Lumia 610 is nearly two times lower than that of its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer fish tank test has been around for some time now. It's HTML 5 based uses the GPU rather than the CPU to do the heavy lifting. The Adreno 200 isn't really the performance champion either though and the Lumia 610 reached just 18 frames per second. In comparison the Omnia W and Lumia 710 went as high as 52 and 50, respectively.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FishIE HTML5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher fps is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's safe to say that the Nokia Lumia 610 isn't the fastest phone around. It's mission is to offer an attractive price tag even if that means cutting a few corners in performance and it shows. The Lumia 610 didn't struggle in too many of its daily tasks, but whenever we had to open more intensive apps such as Nokia Drive or Maps, the effects of the less capable hardware were easy to spot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>People hub: phonebook meets SNS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first tab of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone, social network, email - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and you can also filter contacts by service (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of setting favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access just like regular contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Under their profile photo, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and messages just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 had no trouble holding on to signal, even in areas with spotty coverage. The in-call sound is good and loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls, as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Lumia 610 did good in recognizing our commands, though it did have trouble guessing the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name of "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist - it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone - a feature some of you might miss (it can be done, but it's hard). You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen and for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note: status indicators auto-hide (except the clock) but you can pull them down with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional loudspeaker test on the Nokia Lumia 610 and it got a Good mark. The prominent loudspeaker grille on the back obviously isn't an overstatement and you'll be unlikely to miss any calls. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is WP7's strong suit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging was heavily retooled for version 7.5. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing about Windows Phone is that the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use for the reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages, you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 delivers a unified inbox for email, a highly requested feature. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically merge their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view was expected - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. We expected to be able to swipe between the messages, but that wasn't the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. You can of course search your entire mail for individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains consistent across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard feels a little squeezed on the 3.7" screen, and landscape doesn't seem to provide too much extra space. There's no vibration and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that in apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, and displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your Favorites section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't choose what albums the individual camera roll photos go to, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends so that their Facebook galleries get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll brings together your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Photos can be viewed in both portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch. We appreciate it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 used to be quite limited in terms of sharing - it's still not perfect (photos get downsized before emailing, for one) but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email or Facebook. SkyDrive is not an option though, due to the 256MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as background for the hub or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn't recognize .AVI files - in other words, don't expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 - so, you can watch those formats on the Lumia 610, it's just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities). And of course, HD videos are another casualty of the limited RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pin individual items to the homescreen - like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos and Nokia Music too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which sports the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, giving you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them more like categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has a simple and straightforward interface, you won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are on the side of the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits - swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will let you pin them to the homescreen. RDS is enabled and so is playing through the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Music works as a general music player but with a location-aware twist. You also get access to the Nokia Music store, which is an alternative to the Zune Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs lined up - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location-aware feature is called Gigs - as the name suggests, it finds concerts near you. It's region dependent and may not work everywhere.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Average audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 audio output is much better than the Lumia 710, which is pretty good news. Since its bigger brother was one of the worst performers we have seen, we were worried the Lumia 610 will be downright disastrous, but fortunately that wasn't the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response had its extreme bass frequencies cut off with both headphones and an active external equalizer, but was spot on for the rest of the range. The signal-to-noise and dynamic range readings were great on both occasions, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The total harmonic distortion was good with no headphones attached, but worsened quite a lot when we plugged them in, while the intermodulation distortion went from above average to high. Stereo crosstalk started off as great, but dropped to average with a pair of headphones, which is also what we would say for the overall performance of the Lumia 610 here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP still camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 has a 5MP camera (photos have a maximum resolution of 2592x1944) coupled with a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the gallery. Alternatively, you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more. You have a dedicated Macro mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, always on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key will wake the phone with a single press - that is unlock it and start the camera. There's an option that prevents the shutter key from starting the camera if the proximity sensor is triggered (to prevent accidental launches when the phone is in your pocket). This option is off by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the shutter key on the Nokia Lumia 610. It's very soft to the touch and with distinct half-press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the shots produced with the Nokia Lumia 610 camera is rather mediocre. Resolved detail just isn't up to 5MP standards, colors look washed out and the camera obviously struggles in low-lit scenes. The white balance is often off too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full-res images for you guys to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit we liked how fast the camera was on the Lumia 610, shot to shot times were really zippy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Lumia 610 is okay for those coming from lower megapixel phones and will do the job in case of an amateur photo-shoot emergency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 steps up in our photo quality compare tool to face other 5MP shooters. It turns out that the its snapper is better suited to the studio environment and did slightly better here. It's not exactly a world beater, but at least it's average on the second and third charts and really good on the first one. The tool's page will give you more information on what to look out for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can use scenes, set contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also apply image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 shoots video with up to VGA resolution, which just doesn't cut for a good smartphone anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available while recording. Unlike the Lumia 710 and 800 though, which were a bit too eager to refocus, especially in scenes with movement, the Lumia 610 chooses to lock focus in the center of the scene and keep it there for quite a while before the continuous autofocus eventually kicks back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an untouched VGA video sample (0:12s, 2.36MB) from the Lumia 610's camera for direct download. The bitrate is a low 1600 Kbps, meaning that the videos taken with the Nokia 610 can't really preserve much detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 610 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and 3G with HSPA (7.2Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink). The supported 3G bands vary by region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is currently limited in what it can do - there's no file transfer support, for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Computer sync is done with the desktop Zune application. It's the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Windows Phone - there's no Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync files with Zune over the USB cable and Wi-Fi. There's a Mac version of it available too - the Windows Phone 7 Connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional SD storage isn't available on Windows Phone so the Lumia 610 doesn't offer such an option. Plus, it only packs 8GB of built-in storage, of which you get around 5.6 GB, amounting to a limited storage for many.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get SkyDrive for free though. It's a Microsoft service that gives you 7GB of cloud storage. You can share your photos on SkyDrive but can't have them automatically uploaded as soon as they're taken. That's another feature scrapped as background processes were disabled due to limited RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 610 can act as Wi-Fi hotspot and share its data connection with other devices. All you need is an active microSIM card with a data plan and you're all set.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer Mobile is fast, Flash-less<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile is the only way to go with Windows Phone. Its interface is really simple. The address bar at the bottom is always visible, but the status bar is hidden, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate. Next to the address bar is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended menu, which offers a great deal of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended menu offers tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it also has a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six tab ceiling in from the original release of the OS hasn't been lifted - it's not too bad, but competing OSes don't have such limitations. We were also hoping to see text reflow, but no luck on that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser relies on hardware graphic acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and the JavaScript engine has been retooled as well. Overall, browsing with the Internet Explorer Mobile is a smooth experience. However, if you like numbers you won't be impressed by the performance of WP7.5 in benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace keeps growing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace is playing catch up with the Apple App store and the Android Market. Currently the apps in the Windows Phone Marketplace are a little short of 90 thousand. Due to the lower amount of RAM, the Nokia Lumia 610 has less than that to choose from - 95% of apps should be OK according to Microsoft. Skype, Angry Birds and video-call service Tango aren't supported (yet) on the Lumia 610. Rovio are supposedly working on a compatible version of Angry Birds, and maybe it's more likely than not for Microsoft's very own Skype to eventually follow suit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is organized into three main sections - applications, games and music. Another one called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything over 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it costs 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>App Highlights is preloaded by Nokia. It offers an assortment of apps into several categories to give you a start. The first category is actually called Starter kit - a list of what are considered vital apps (e.g. YouTube, Netflix, etc.), then there's Addictive (games go there), Health+ and Foodies have apps to help you stay fit or indulge yourself respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is accelerometer-enabled and can reshuffle the lists of applications every time you shake the phone, which is a fun way to find new apps. Also, the tile for the app would occasionally change to promote some of the apps it recommends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It lets you try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as a what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. Compatibility issues are to be expected here as well. Reportedly, one out of four Xbox Live games will not run on 256MB of RAM and that's not as bad as some people may've feared.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps for basic mapping<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows Phone is Bing Maps. They have driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free, but they're not a match for Nokia's bespoke applications (we'll discuss them in the next section).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that are easy to read. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Normally, Windows Phone devices have a location-based service called Local Scout, which detects points of interest near you - restaurants, cafes, complete with user recommendations, reviews, etc. The feature is missing from the Lumia 610, due yet again to its hardware limitations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Nokia Drive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a lower-end offering than the Lumia 710, 800 and 900 one would think the Lumia 610 would miss out on the cool lifetime voice-guided navigation that Nokia WP smartphones are so proud of. But that's not the case - both Nokia Maps and, more importantly, Drive come preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes the Nokia Lumia 610 about a minute to get GPS lock and you can make that even faster if you have a data connection for the A-GPS. Wi-Fi and Cell-ID positioning are also available if you only need a rough idea of your whereabouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps is an alternative to Microsoft's Bing Maps. It lets you view maps in three different modes - map, satellite and public transport. You can use pinch zoom to navigate the map (you can also enable old-school zoom controls) and panning around is fast and smooth. Nokia Maps does only 2D mode - there's no 3D option like Google Maps has for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It pulls its maps from the Internet, so you'll need an Internet connection to use it. Yes, even if you have downloaded offline maps for Nokia Drive (which we found to be weird).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the more interesting part of the duo, the Nokia Drive, unlike Maps, lets you easily download maps for offline usage for any country in the world - free of charge, of course. Bigger countries are split into pieces, if you don't want to waste your limited internal memory with maps you'll never need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps aren't that big - the map for the whole of the US is 1.9GB, while the map for the entire UK, for example, is 274MB. The 8GB of built-in memory is more than enough for any trip you're likely to take. It's easy to delete unneeded maps or download new ones on the go wherever there is Wi-Fi. Nokia Drive can operate in Offline mode too, which is a must-have feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive does support a 3D view, unlike Maps. It also has 3D landmarks for some of the bigger world cities. You can also use 2D mode if that's what you prefer, but in 3D you get to see further down the road than in 2D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than 2D/3D, settings are pretty scarce - you can toggle daylight and night color schemes, choose whether landmarks should be displayed and choose a voice for the navigation. Many voices in a number of languages are available for free download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were hoping for options to fine-tune the routing algorithm - like avoid toll roads, find fastest or shortest route and so on - but there were none to be had. You just set your destination (with an option to review the planned route before you go), hit start and you're off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While navigating, you can zoom in and out depending on your preference to see more of the road ahead or more details. At the top of the screen is an instruction for the next turn in big, easy to read white on blue letters and a big icon noting the turn. At the bottom of the screen you have the time remaining and current speed. Those get pushed to the left side of the screen in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like Nokia Drive's no-distraction's approach to navigation, but we are used to having more control over how the route is planned. A few other options would have been welcome too (the Symbian version of Nokia's SatNav solution is very feature-rich).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Lumia 610 beats all non-Nokia Windows Phone handsets on the market. The free voice-guided navigation might be just what it takes to convince people to go for the cheaper Lumia 610, instead of competing WP phones - at least in that price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Maps and Nokia Drive are the two apps that take longest to launch. The 256MB of RAM were never as painfully evident in the entire interface. The Nokia Drive takes close to 30 seconds to fully load. It goes on fairly smooth from then and we think most people should be able to forgive a budget smartphone for testing their patience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured Office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Mango, SkyDrive integration is one thing that was improved. Docs are now automatically synced between the phone and your computer and Microsoft are offering free 7GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - the Locations tab replaces the old SharePoint tab. This lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still, there's little doubt that Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use and has an iOS-esque interface. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in PIM but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an app called Contacts Transfer, which does just that - it pairs with another phone over Bluetooth and leeches out your address book. This makes switching from your old phone to the Nokia Lumia 610 a smooth sailing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WindowsPhone.com remotely protects your data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone website is the cloud of sorts for all WP7 smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use the site is register your email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) and then setup an account on your Windows Phone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options given to you on the windowsphone.com website are limited to billing information and security. You can update your billing information, view the apps you've bought and go to the web version of the WP Marketplace and buy new apps. Take note that they will be sent to your phone to be downloaded locally on the device, unlike on the Zune app for your PC or Mac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features most important to users are the Find, Ring, Lock or Erase. To use them you'll have to input a phone number out of a growing list totaling 50 supported countries. After you've done this the website will have access to your phone's location so you'll be able to pinpoint its almost exact location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features are pretty self-explanatory. Ring will use your phone's ringtone to send a single if you've lost it around the house, Lock will lock it with a 4-digit PIN code and Erase will wipe all your sensitive data off the device so you don't have to worry about it falling into undesirable hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about the windowsphone.com cloud is that it doesn't allow wireless sync like on the iCloud, for example. We just think that any cloud-based service should offer this. Also the number of countries that allow tracking your device is limited and many countries where WP is available won't have access to these much-needed features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the website includes guides on each individual feature of your phone and depending on where you live there's a very detailed list of providers and operators that offer WP handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making Windows Phone more accessible was one of the goals Nokia set out to achieve when the deal with Microsoft was sealed. Well, it took the Finns only five months after the release of their first Microsoft-powered smartphones, to come up with the Lumia 610, which is ready to challenge the Windows Phone definition of affordable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering that the Nokia Lumia 610 is a first attempt, and essentially a conscious downgrade, the end result is pretty solid. The smartphone behaves way smoother than its spec sheet suggests. Sure, heavy apps like Nokia Drive take a while to load but the overall speed and response are good. Surprisingly good, to be fair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That leaves the issue of app incompatibility due to insufficient RAM. No two ways about it, not having Skype is bad but, with some developers already busy accommodating the lower specs, Microsoft are not likely to leave their own service out for long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The free lifetime voice-guided navigation on the other hand is probably worth a huge chunck of the price tag on its own and the build quality is better than what we are used to seeing in this class. A screen of this size and resolution is also hard to come by in the sub-?200 bracket and it's another point in the Lumia 610's favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there's no denying the fact that Windows Phone ecosystem is still catching up with Android (even if the Lumia 610 competitors are all still running Gingerbread) in terms of both features and choice of apps. The droid rivals have the luxury too of choosing from a number of chipsets, some of which are powerful enough to handle the more demanding OS. That makes WP increasingly hard to recommend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not get ahead of ourselves and take a look at what smartphones are out there to threaten the Lumia 610. We'll begin with some in-house competition. The Lumia 710 has been out for a while and its price is currently quite close to that of the Lumia 610 - even lower in some markets. It offers a faster processor, more RAM, meaning you'll be getting the full WP experience (apps or otherwise). It has a superior camera to boot, with decent 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 710</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W is only slightly more expensive than the Lumia 610 but it has some clear advantages. The front is dominated by a beautiful SuperAMOLED display. The back features a fine 5 MP camera, and there's a more powerful processor inside making the whole UI feel much smoother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Omnia W I8350</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A short stroll over to Android takes us to a likable little smartphone by Sony. The Xperia U is not only the most affordable dual-core smartphone, but it's also offering a Bravia-powered display of slightly better resolution and a flashy transparent strip that changes color to match the screen contents. Even more impressively, the Xperia U costs about the same as the Lumia 610, and might turn out to be the one to beat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia U</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just like in most other price brackets we have an alternative by Samsung. The Ace 2 is basically offering the same package as the Xperia U, but solves the memory issue with a microSD card slot and adds a slightly larger screen. It does cost about ?40 extra though, and that's a significant difference here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 I8160</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth is the Nokia Lumia 610 is currently slightly overpriced. We did say that it's all about what you get and not what you miss in this class but, as things currently stand, its competitors will give you more without extra charge. It sounds like common sense that the only way for an affordable WP smartphone to succeed is to be cheaper than its droid peers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Lumia 610 looks like the right phone for Nokia. An entry level smartphone could do well for them in traditionally loyal markets. This affordable option may also be an awareness raiser in the buildup to Windows Phone 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Would you call it common sense too that if they got Windows Phone 7 to run on an 800MHz chip and 256MB of RAM, they might as well find a way to put Apollo on the current single-core smartphones? It seems the Lumia 610 gives loyal Windows Phone users something to look forward to. And we don't just mean a price drop. Although one can really do wonders for the prospects of what is otherwise a pretty good smartphone for first-time users.</paragraph>
