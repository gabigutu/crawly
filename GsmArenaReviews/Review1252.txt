		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus S is the top dog in the Korean company?s Windows Phone lineup. It is the bigger brother of the Samsung Focus Flash in AT&amp;T?s smartphone lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The term ?bigger? is almost entirely related to size here. Due to Microsoft?s tight hardware restrictions for their Windows Phone platform, the line between a flagship and a budget device is quite thin. Thus, the Focus S and Focus Flash share chipsets and CPUs. The differences between the two are in the screen size, built-in memory, and the camera units ? here the Focus S is better equipped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus S, despite being a new release, should look quite familiar to you. In a rather clever fashion, Samsung?s designers have decided to shape the device as a twin to the highly successful I9100 Galaxy S II ? not a bad idea given the fact that the Android powered handset is still selling like hotcakes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we?ll kick the review off with the key features of the Samsung Focus S, followed by its main disadvantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve already encountered Windows Phone 7.5 Mango on several occasions. The OS has significantly matured with the latest update ? it is now a viable alternative for those, who don?t want to go down the iOS or Android road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly however, Microsoft?s creation leaves no room for customization. You get the same experience, regarding of the device you?re using it on. This means that it is up to the hardware of the respective devices to win the potential consumer over ? a welcome news for the Samsung Focus S, given its Galaxy S II pedigree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is unboxing of the Focus S, followed by an inspection of its design and build quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The retail package has all bases covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the small, AT&amp;T branded retail box of the Samsung Focus S, you will find everything you need. There is a charger, a USB cable, and a pair of high quality Samsung earbuds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, we cannot expect to find a memory card in the box, as the phone does not have a slot for one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing revolutionary about the looks of the Samsung Focus S ? we already mentioned this above. The phone looks almost identical to the original Galaxy S II, save for the button configuration at the front, and the slightly rounder edges. From certain angles you can easily mistake the device for its Android cousin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung has relied heavily on high quality plastic when building the Focus S. This might not be to everyone?s taste, but the end result is a light and easily pocketable phone. The front of the device is protected by Corning?s Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With measures of 126 x 66.8 x 8.5 mm and 110.6 grams of weight, the Samsung Focus S has almost the exact same measures as the I9100. It has even managed to shed 5 grams of its waistline ? not a bad thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all black color scheme of the phone, coupled with the Super AMOLED Plus screen, give it a pleasantly understated look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3? Super AMOLED Plus display with WVGA resolution of the Focus S is a familiar sight. Its contrast and viewing angles are nothing short of superb. The screen is a perfect match to the Windows Phone OS. When using a dark color scheme for the OS, there is practically no telling of where the screen borders are ? it is perfectly integrated with the rest of the device?s hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, you will find the usual for all Windows Phone devices, three buttons. In the case of the Samsung Focus S, they are touch-sensitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, you will find the earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the 1.3MP front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the left side of the device. On the right, you will find the power/lock key, along with a dedicated camera button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm audio jack, along with a secondary microphone for active noise cancelling is residing on top of the Focus S. On the bottom, you will find the microUSB port and the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera and its LED flash are on the back of the device. Just like in the Galaxy S II, there is a chin on the back, where the loudspeaker grille resides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the paper-thin battery cover us business as usual. A SIM card slot and the battery itself can be found there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1650 mAh battery of the Samsung Focus S is exactly the same as the Galaxy S II?s. It achieved a score of the respectable rate of 38 hours in our battery test. This means that if you use your device for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day, you will have to recharge it every 38 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Samsung Focus S battery scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get the full scoop on the battery test of the Samsung Focus S here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the Samsung Focus S pleasant to handle. The grippy plastic on the back prevents the thin body from accidental drops. The device feels solidly built despite its low weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are going to continue now with the software tour of the Samsung Focus S. Things might look familiar here as the OS looks and feels the same on all devices its runs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface: Windows Phone 7.5 Mango<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus S comes with Microsoft?s latest Windows Phone 7.5 Mango update. By now, it should be a familiar sight since we?ve tested several devices which run the OS, including Samsung?s own Focus Flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the Samsung Focus S in action. See it below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pushing the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. The background of the lock screen can be changed from either the settings menu or from the picture gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a very fluid vertical grid of Live tiles that shows one or two tiles organized in bricked style. Each of these can be reorganized by whichever order you like and you can place almost anything in the grid by holding your finger over it and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live tiles, the basic building blocks of the Start screen of Windows Phone have been revamped. Now they are quicker and offer more info. For example, the Pictures tile shows an animated slideshow of your images. The Group tile (Groups is a new feature to boot) lists friend updates. The application list has grown a virtual Search button, which makes finding apps easier for those with many apps installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the main novelties brought by the latest WP build - 7.5 Mango - is multitasking. It still isn't true multitasking; things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We only worry that this logic can be too restrictive for some apps, but we'll see how things pan out. Of course, there will be a transitional period when some apps will support multitasking and others won't. We've been there with the iOS, when it first left the realm of single-tasking ? it?s not that bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key (that's right, the Back key, not the Windows key). The app switcher itself looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to exactly how you left it. Usually, the last 5-6 apps are here. You can't "kill" any of those apps, this is more of a history of the recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, as you open more apps, the old ones start to drop out of the list. Once an app is gone, you have to launch it again the old fashioned way, which has the drawback of starting it over from the beginning. Finally apps with active background tasks (e.g. streaming online radio) will keep on working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled from the settings to save battery. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu reveals two sets of options - system and applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Applications settings enables you to configure individual settings for each app you have installed on the device - the People hub, Phone, Maps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (*cough*Android*cough*) but voice commands are a big part of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A hub for a phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub from Windows Phone 7 was impressive, but the 7.5 update makes it absolutely brilliant. Part of that is due to the better social network support, complete with Twitter and LinkedIn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty much the same. You still get the clever way of jumping to contacts starting with a specific letter, the What's new tab that aggregates status updates from all contacts and the Recent tab, which lists only recently viewed contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And deeper social networking support makes things even better. When viewing a contact's profile, you get everything from call, text, send email, write on wall, mention on Twitter and so on. The contact photo, along with its latest status update is visible on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The What's new tab works like its namesake in the People hub, but only shows updates from the specific contact. Pictures is the place where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting addition is the new History tab. The complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features of the hub is Groups, a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People hub is present in the Phone app too. It takes the form of a contacts tab but only instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term taken right out of social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the ?What?s new? panel?, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hassle free telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Call reception on the Samsung Focus S was good and it held on to signal even in closed quarters where by default the signal bars drop a few. In-call sound quality is brilliant and loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Focus S did well in recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smooth messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging was heavily retooled for version 7.5. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages; you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the new OS (that is dependent on the carrier and your plan). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email where Mango contributed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the highly requested features was a unified inbox for email - and Windows Phone 7.5 delivers. You can now link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view was expected - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It?s the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. We expected to be able to swipe between the messages, but that wasn?t the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone constitutes of the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same on all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard comes in many sizes, depending on the device. On the Samsung Focus S, it's quite comfortable and, given that currently the smallest WP7 screen found on a phone is 3.5", there can't be any size complaints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection and copy-paste functionality were desired functions even before the 7.5 Mango update. They became a reality with the pre-Mango No-Do update. Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The picture gallery is gorgeous<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub has been polished up a bit in Windows Phone Mango. There's a new People tab, which lets you browse photo albums by individual contacts or groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums contain the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 used to be quite restricted when it came to sharing - it's still not perfect (it still downsizes photos before emailing them, for one) but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the Samsung Focus S, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio stations so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won?t have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings along a slight change in design to the now playing screen. The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are now placed horizontally next to the album cover instead of hidden behind it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus S sounded great on a loudspeaker, or with headphones attached. A normal user will find nothing to complain about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>An 8MP camera with a dedicated button<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus S packs an 8MP autofocus camera, capable of shooting photos with 3264x2448 pixels in resolution. An LED flash is on board as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, second video-call camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera; alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlocking it and start the camera. There's an option that prevents the shutter key from starting the camera if the proximity sensor is triggered (to prevent accidental launches when the phone is in your pocket). This option is off by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images captured with the 8MP camera of the Samsung Focus S come out pretty good ? there's plenty of detail and noise is kept well under control. Contrast is good too, but colors are a bit oversaturated and the white balance is a bit too cold for our liking.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video camera maxes out at 720p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your captured videos appear in a thumbnail slideshow just as they do in the Pictures hub and Music &amp; videos hub. You get a flash on/off toggle in the settings menu too - the phone uses the LED as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as on every other WP smartphone the Samsung Focus S video recording capabilities max out at 720p. That's no longer considered top of the food chain achievement and you should expect miracles from it. Still, the Focus S videos aren't bad either with a good amount of resolved detail (for the 720p league), smooth framerate and decent colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video, captured with Samsung Focus S?s camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, as always, here goes an untouched 720p video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is abundant with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus S has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and tril-band 3G with HSPA (14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support, for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune computer application. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Windows Phone ? there's no Mass storage mode, even now with Mango.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync files with Zune over the USB cable and Wi-Fi. There?s a Mac version of available too - Windows Phone 7 Connector. You can check our detailed review of the Zune software here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional SD storage isn't available on Windows Phone so the Focus S doesn't offer such an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB of cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings Wi-Fi hotspot functionality too. All you need is an active SIM card with a data connection and you're all set.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is flash-less, but impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone was updated to the latest version for the 7.5 update and it improves the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar is always visible (but the status bar at the top of the screen is auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalist - you have only the URL bar at the bottom with a reload icon to the left. Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it does offer a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six tab ceiling hasn?t been lifted - it's not too bad, but competing OSes don't have such limitations. We were also hoping to see text reflow, but no luck on that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What has changed is performance - the new browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and the JavaScript engine have been retooled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft are so confident that they've set up a page specifically for testing the performance of your phone - both JavaScript and graphics. You can find the page here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't be afraid to pit the phone against even a desktop browser - the tests are pretty demanding and if you're not running a recent version of the major desktop browsers, your computer will surely break a sweat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search has the looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also grew two new search modes - song recognition and barcode scanner. Those are features popular with apps, but with WP7.5 you get those natively as part of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Marketplace is still trailing the big boys<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace is playing catch up with the Apple Appstore and the Android Market. Currently it has north of 38 thousand apps available. It?s organized into four main sections ? applications, games, music and the Samsung Zone. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, then three more featured artists, a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (its 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox Live<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We did test games like Need for Speed, Kinectimals, Angry birds and had no problems with the Samsung Focus S, the 1.4GHz processor and Adreno 205 GPU were more than adequate in handling more complex graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bing Maps is the heart of the Windows Phone "getting around" scene, until Nokia's WP devices come along with full-fledged voice guided navigation for free via Nokia Drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps is a core part of the Windows Phone experience and there's a new feature that makes version 7.5 a must-have - driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though; it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the new Maps can do for you though. The app will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool functionality of Local scout is you can pin places to your homescreen. So let's say you like a pub and like to check it out from time to time, read reviews, call for a reservation - it's right there on your homescreen - that's neat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office is fully covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Mango SkyDrive integration is one thing that was improved. Now, docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive. In case you missed it, Microsoft is offering free 25GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - the Locations tab replaces the old SharePoint tab. This lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Officeweb apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported. PowerPoint files live in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub got better too - it grew the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The organizer doesn?t disappoint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing skills on Windows Phone are dully covered. You have the usual calendar, alarm, calculator, to-do apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It seems hard to find a better player than the Samsung Focus S in the US Windows Phone game at the moment. The device?s hardware is as good as it gets for the platform, but its main selling point is certainly the Super AMOLED Plus screen ? its ultra-deep blacks and Microsoft?s Metro UI are a match made in heaven.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However Microsoft?s hardware limitations do not allow for better differentiation between budget and high-end Windows Phone devices and that may steer a lot of people clear from spending extra cash on the same user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And given that the Samsung Focus S is priced at $199.99 with a two-year contract on AT&amp;T Wireless it's in the pond with some pretty big fish. For this amount of money, you can purchase a lot of high end smartphones, but chances are that if you are considering the Focus S, you have already set your mind on the Windows Phone platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most obvious alternative to the Focus S is the HTC Titan. The smartphone is offered by AT&amp;T for the same price as the Samsung. It stands out with a bigger 4.7? screen and metal clad body. Keep in mind, however, that 4.7? display with WVGA resolution is not the prettiest sight around. And the Titan screen lacks the contrast and viewing angles of the Focus S Super AMOLED Plus unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Titan</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 is also a great choice, provided that money is no object. The device looks beautiful, has a screen up to snuff, and is more pocketable than the Samsung. Sadly, the Lumia 800 isn't available at a carrier-subsidized rate in the US just yet so you'll have to go SIM-free if you choose it. And that's certainly not a cheap option - you'll have to spend north of $700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 800</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus Flash has the same chipset as the Focus S, but comes with a lower-res camera and its AMOLED uses the PenTile matrix. However, the Focus Flash costs only a quarter of the price of its bigger brother on AT&amp;T and, dare we say, looks better. If you are on a budget, this device should be on your list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Focus Flash I677</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there is no shortage of WP options on the market. Yet, all the Focus S alternatives will require you to make a compromise of some kind, so if you are living in the US and looking to jump into the Windows Phone pool at this point, going for the Samsung Focus S is a choice you are unlikely to regret.</paragraph>
