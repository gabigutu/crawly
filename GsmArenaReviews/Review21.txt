			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There was a time when Windows Mobile used to rule the smartphone seas. Then along came Symbian but that?s a whole other story. It was touchscreen that showed to all the willing challengers that Windows Mobile is just too big to turn around quickly enough and catch the new wind. HTC however seem to disagree and dispel doubts of jumping ship. They have not given up on the cause and the HTC HD mini is the living proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, mini is perhaps the right approach to users who would otherwise feel timid about giving Windows Mobile a try ? especially with so many touchscreen temptations around. On the other hand, it does matter whose mini version it is. The almighty HD2 was the first PocketPC with a capacitive screen and a Snapdragon core.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the HTC HD mini is obviously shorter on size, resolution and processing power. But it may be well worth the resources invested in making it what it is ? a pocket-friendly, but still powerful handset with solid build, slick design and a touch-friendly UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the HTC HD mini key strengths and possible turn-offs in the lists below to get an idea if this is the handset that will suit you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We all know there?s more to a contemporary smartphone (touchscreen at that) than its spec sheet. The HTC HD mini certainly has the pedigree but the verdict will only be passed on its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile has been known to be pretty demanding on a phone?s processing power, and the Sense UI probably takes its toll too. Our initial impressions of the HD mini were downright positive but it still needs to pass the test of a full review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Reasonable retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC HD mini comes in a modestly-sized box, but if there?s anything that this phone is trying to teach us is that size isn?t all important. Indeed, all the essentials are covered and the only major omission is a memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It leaves you with no adequate storage out of the box but microSD cards go for pennies these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the box you will find a microUSB cable, a one-piece headset and a very sleek charger. The microUSB cable is used for both data connections and charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a whole load of paperwork inside the retail package, including a leaflet with an activation key for the CoPilot navigation software. Don?t get your hopes too high though as it is only good for 15 days ? you will need to purchase a license after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also made a short unboxing video to show you what the HD mini accessories look like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC HD mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini is way smaller than the HTC HD2, but that?s hardly a great achievement by itself. Miniaturization is nowhere near the scale of the XPERIA X10 mini. The HTC HD mini has the benefit of a reasonably sized screen though and a slimmer waistline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini stands at 103 x 57.7 x 11.7 mm, which is just slightly more compact than the average touchphone. However this is more than enough to make it amazingly pocket-friendly and we doubt it there will be too many people unhappy with its size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini weight of 110 grams comes as a little surprise given the dimensions. We do like it when a phone weighs more than its volume suggests as it gives a nice solid feel. Still, even if you like your phones light, the HD mini won?t disappoint.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-black body of the HTC HD mini probably won?t blow your mind but we do appreciate the solid gadgety feel of this stocky bloke. The time-tested formula of quality build and minimalistic design has worked once again for HTC. It?s the accents they added however, that work quite well too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini is targeting a younger audience than the HD2 and those are exactly the kind of people that might appreciate those oddities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, the HTC HD mini rear cover notably adds to the phone?s size. It covers the sides of the handset too. One would think that designing a mini handset, they?d need to shave every possible millimeter off but maybe HTC opted for ruggedness instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the front inevitably brings us to the 3.2? capacitive touchscreen of HVGA resolution. Its image quality is pretty decent, though nowhere near Super AMOLED standards (not even regular AMOLED). In the TFT world the HD mini doesn?t rank too bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD mini has a HVGA display, instead of the WVGA unit of the HTC HD2. The downsides are obvious but the good news is the mini doesn?t need a 1 GHz Snapdragon to offer similar performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower screen resolution is most noticeable in some applications like the web browser (where less content fits on the screen) and image gallery (where the photos look less detailed). But still the HD mini display doesn?t fare too bad in terms of pixel density. After all, if the iPhone can get away with stretching HVGA over 3.5 inches, then why should the HTC HD mini be criticized about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have discussed the 65K-color limitation of Windows Mobile many times before but here?s the short summary. You will notice banding when looking at single-color gradients on the HTC HD mini but the 3.2? display makes it less prominent than on 3.7? and larger screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, an area where the HD mini fails to impress is sunlight legibility. The HTC latest device isn?t the worst we have seen but is still less than enjoyable to operate in the bright sun. Windows Mobile phones have never actually done particularly well under direct sunlight so fans of the OS are probably used to it by now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display we find five capacitive controls ? the two call keys along with the home, menu and back buttons. It?s the same layout as the HD2 but this time they?re all touch-sensitive instead of actual press buttons. The haptic-enabled capacitive keys are well sized and spaced. The transition from and to the display is always seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the HTC HD mini display is the earpiece dead center and a status LED to the left of it. A stylish chrome accent at the top marks the earpiece out and hosts the power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side hosts the volume rocker, which works throughout the interface, controlling the ringing and system volumes. It?s well sized and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is completely bare and that?s bad news for all those who expected to find a camera key there. HTC might?ve thought touch focus makes up for the lack of an actual half-press shutter key but it would?ve been handy to have a shortcut to start the camera too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is at the bottom of the HTC HD mini, right next to the microUSB port. There is no cover over the connectivity port to keep dust and moisture away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same holds true for the 3.5mm audio jack on top. It is placed on a sloping surface so the jacks you plug in will always slightly stick out even if they are properly connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing of interest at the top is the power key, which also acts as a screen lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini back hosts the unprotected but deeply embedded camera lens, located right next to the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no flash of any kind so the HD mini won?t be doing much of a job in low-light shoots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screw heads at the four corners at the back might not be everyone?s cup of tea but we do like them. Another design quirk is only revealed if you remove the rear cover. The phone?s inner body ? including the battery ? is flashy yellow. The lower bit is semi transparent and you can see the bits and pieces the thing is made of, a bit like a Swatch watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?ll also notice that the screws are real, not just decoration. Not that you?ll possibly have ? or need ? the right screwdriver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood we find the SIM card compratment, the microSD card slot and the 1200 mAh battery. Despite being under the cover, the microSD card is fully hot-swappable. We had no issues with a 16GB microSD card so we are guessing 32GB won?t be any trouble too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini lasted for two days on a single charge under what might be considered regular use (15 minutes of telephony, 30 minutes of browsing over Wi-Fi, several shots with the camera and 30 minutes of fiddling with the other apps a day). If you tend to push your phone harder, chances are you?ll have to charge daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the HTC HD mini is commendable, the handset feeling sturdy in the hand and all. We suspect the rubbery rear panel might start showing signs of wear and tear sooner than the rest of the body but we cannot be certain of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to styling, we do like the solid gadgety feel and the industrial accents. This mini lives up to its name ? it looks and feels friendly and inviting. At the same time, a 3.2? capacitive screen is quite a good deal in a handset this size. The great response is an added gain. Of course, sunlight legibility and resolution are less than stellar, but you can?t have it all in a mini. Basically, you get what you signed for: a smaller (and cheaper) HTC HD2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? Windows Mobile is all but gone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC are reportedly pondering their own OS ? we?re this close to thinking they?ve done it already. Starting with TouchFLO and following with Sense, HTC have been continually painting over the aging interface of WinMo, and aside from a few blank spots, everything is silky smooth Sense UI on the HD mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Programs menu uses the honeycomb pattern from Windows Mobile 6.5.3, and that?s one of the better changes 6.5 brought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Icons within the main menu are easy to rearrange: a press and hold is enough to move the frequently used icons to the top. However, the menu structure is flat and can quickly become overcrowded with icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few folders, but you can?t move shortcuts into them or create new folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other places left untouched by HTC?s pixie dust are the file manager, the email app and the advanced options when editing a contact, but when using the HD mini you?ll spend most of the time in Sense UI land.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to look at the centerpiece of the Sense UI ? the homescreen. It uses the well-known tabbed interface, with plenty of eye candy for anything from the weather forecast to messages, photos and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lot of the key functionality resides on the homescreen ? there?s a tab for almost anything you can think of. In the HTC HD2 review, we had an in-depth look into each tab, so you can check it out for more details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll go over each tab again, but we won?t waste too much time ? they are quite intuitive and you can get going without a manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home tab gives you access to the revamped calendar, world clock and alarm. Swiping up brings out a dock in which you can assign nine quick links to almost any app or setting on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home tab has its own context menu, where you can change the homescreen wallpaper - there are both animated and still backgrounds, but you can also opt for a weather wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the People tab, you can set 12 shortcuts to your favorite contacts ? each shortcut can be set to either dial the contact, send a message (text or email) or view the contact?s details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages tab and the Email tab work similarly ? they present you with a stack of messages, which you can browse by vertical sweeps and there are handy shortcuts to create a new message. The Email tab can handle several mailboxes ? there?s a button for each mailbox and these buttons can be used to switch between mailboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet tab launches the Internet Explorer Mobile 6 web browser (you can switch that to Opera if you like). You can scroll down to your favorite bookmarks (maximum 10, displayed as thumbs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar is nicely touch-optimized and packed with functionality. You can change between the Month and Agenda view or by tapping on a date ? the Day view, which also offers a weather forecast (for days up to 5 days in the future).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks tab displays various stock quotes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos and Video tab gives you access to your images and video files, which you can scroll with finger sweeps. Two additional shortcuts allow you to start the camera or camcorder directly from here. You can also launch the Album app or start a slideshow, but the landscape mode is gone (tapping a photo still displays it fullscreen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music tab displays Album art and the essential play/pause and skip buttons, as well as toggle shuffle and repeat modes. Here, the landscape mode is gone too. Since this is the main interface of the music player, we?ll revisit it later on in the review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Weather tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Weather tab still amazes with its beautiful graphics. It displays the weather today and for the next five days. You can check the weather in up to 7 locations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Twitter and Footprints tabs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Twitter tab is a full blown Twitter app ? you can read tweets but also post new ones. The tab automatically handles things like URL shortening, adding a photo (from the gallery or a new one) and geotagging the tweets. The URL shortener and photo upload can work with several services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Footprints are geotagged photos stored with additional information such as a note, a name, a phone number, or a website.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Settings tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Settings tab lets you control various system options and replaces the old and confusing Windows Mobile Settings page. Alternatively, you can access the standard WinMo settings by tapping on the All Settings key, but that?s hardly our preferred course of action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize option can be used to customize tabs. In Sound &amp; Display you can find the on/off switch for the relatively new Pocket mode (we saw it on the HD2 as well) - upon an incoming call, the phone automatically recognizes that you're carrying it in your pocket or purse and sets its maximum ringing volume so you won't miss the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to Pocket mode, you also have Quiet ring on pickup. This does exactly what the name suggests - if your phone is ringing, the moment you pick it up from the desk it turns down the ringing volume considerably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, Wireless controls is the new name for the Communication manager, while the Data Services packs all kind of accounts and data sync options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new System status screen is also here. When you touch the icons on the top of the Home screen, you'll bring up the notifications area where you can check missed events, operator messages, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections, battery life and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this is the only way to switching apps ? and it?s a long one. From the status screen, you select the Task Manager, and finally a double-tap switches to the desired app. That?s 4 taps in total, 2 more than it should have been if you ask us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another way to view various notifications such as missed calls, new messages or emails, or even today's appointments is through the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the traditional Spb Benchmark to try and find out how much of a difference there is between the HD mini and its big bro, the HD2. Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD mini?s CPU performed respectably given the sizeable gap in processor speed and amounts of RAM, but there were occasions when the HD mini would lag. Not always, and not in the same place, but there were hang-ups, which made it seem unresponsive for several moments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, we?re perfectly pleased with its overall performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contact manager is great, embraces Facebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile is no longer targeting corporate users mainly but top notch contact management and synchronization features are still easily taken for granted. HTC however have turned the ugly duckling of an interface into a beautiful Sense UI swan, but also built on the features to make the contact app even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts use a tabbed interface, similar to the homescreen and you can navigate it the same way - by dragging a finger over the shortcut bar or by onscreen sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search for a specific contact with the alphabet scroll or by gradual typing of the name. There are two ways to organize contacts ? favorites (the ones from the People tab on the homescreen) and Groups. Favorites is like a special group and it gets its own tab in the Contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Updates &amp; Events, which displays updates from your contacts and has a shortcut to your unread messages. The last one is the Call History tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard editing options are just great ? sleek looking and quite extensive. If you need extra fields, the More button at the bottom is here to help ? however it drops you back into Windows Mobile land.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact editing UI has been updated since the days of WinMo 6.1, but is still unsightly and not particularly user friendly. To make it worse, HTC use the Notes field to store metadata (Facebook profile, etc.) in XML format. This makes editing advanced fields quite an unpleasant trip outside the comfort of Sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact is very stylish and visually attractive ? it?s among the most usable interfaces we?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A contact's information is neatly divided into categories - name, actions and information. There are five icons on a taskbar at the bottom - details, messaging, all emails, events and call history. You can scroll between the different tabs the same way you do it with the tabbed homescreens - by dragging a finger over the shortcut bar or by onscreen sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can compose a SMS/MMS directly in the message tab and messages are displayed in threaded view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Events tab is all about social networking. You can associate every contact with their Facebook profile. If you do that, the HD mini will automatically set birthday and download the contact?s profile picture and use it for contact photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The events tab will show you the new Facebook updates of the person in question and their mood message will appear in the contact list just under their name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other extra you receive with the Facebook link is the additional Online Album key in the General Information tab - it gives you full access to Facebook albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook makes information quick and easy to find and sending an SMS or an email is as easy as it gets. We love what HTC have done with the place ? both visually and functionally.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is always a priority for any phone and PocketPCs such as the HD mini are no exception. And like most other recent HTC handsets, this one keeps to the high standard of in-call quality, crisp and loud sound and strong signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you dial someone, the HD mini vibrates to let you know when the call is connected. The proximity sensor automatically locks the display when you put it at your ear to prevent accidental presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone application offers Smart dialing, so you hardly ever need to go to the Contact list in order to dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the HTC HD mini a familiar cool feature: you can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you turn the handset back up, the ringing won't resume by itself. Don't worry, it's unlikely your calls will get muted accidentally in your pocket - the feature is set up in such a way that it's more likely to not engage at all rather than engage for no particular reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One point of note though is that if the HD mini is already face down when a call comes in, you need to flip it face up and then face down for the feature to take effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD mini did quite well in our loudness test. It snatched a Very Good mark and here is how it stacks up against some other handsets we've tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini supports SMS, MMS and email. Both text and multimedia messages share an inbox and an editor ? and thanks to Sense UI you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and in longer messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox is also available as a homescreen tab with eye-catching styling. The email editor will hold no surprises for experienced WinMo users as it hasn?t changed at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest mid or high range phones. You type your email and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the HD mini. The device relies on three virtual keyboards ? a regular numpad, a half-QWERTY and a full QWERTY. These are available in portrait mode ? in landscape you automatically get the full QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The orientation switch is made automatically thanks to the accelerometer, but it also hides the keyboard, so there?s an extra tap needed to continue typing. There is no handwriting recognition, but we don?t think it is a huge loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The half and full QWERTY keyboards are available in multiple languages with a convenient button to switch between the different layouts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery does multi-touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HD mini offers a nice thumbnail browser straight in the Photos &amp; Videos tab on the Home screen ? and we already saw it in the UI chapter. It?s the best way to quickly preview all the images on the phone, both preloaded and captured by you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the actual gallery, you need to either hit Albums in the Photos &amp; Videos tab, or launch it from the Programs menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image is opened automatically in landscape mode and there is no option to rotate it to portrait view. Once the image is opened, you can zoom in or out using the pinch gesture or the double tab, or skip back and forth by finger sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming and panning is blazing fast ? the HD mini keeps up with the HD2 (of course, it only needs to refresh fewer screen pixels). But it won?t choke on even full-res 5MP images from the camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player iPod-style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like recent HTC PocketPCs, the HD mini has a good music player that makes excellent use of Album art. The music player is accessible straight on the Sense home screen with a cool Apple-like Cover Flow animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls on the homescreen let you scrub through the song, go to the previous/next track and toggle shuffle and repeat modes. The landscape mode from the HD2 is not present though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a track does not have album art, the music player has the option to automatically find one using Gracenote. You can have it search for just the current song, the songs in the Now playing list or all songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to filter tracks by other than album, the Library shortcut will take you to the player backend where you can sort music by artist, genre, composer, purchased tracks or simply create custom playlists. The visual interface of the library is fluid and eerily reminiscent of iPhone's very own music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets are available only when you have the headset plugged in. They are not part of the music player itself but of a separate application called Audio Booster. That setup allows you to make use of the presets when you watch videos or even when you listen to music on an alternative player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the 3.5 mm audio jack you can plug your favorite headset in and worry not about the bundled headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The FM radio does the job perfectly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini built-in FM radio naturally requires the headset to be plugged-in. It has an excellent interface much like the rest of the multimedia players on board and offers memory for some 20 radio stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS is available too and there is a sleep function, which can turn off the radio automatically after 30, 60 or 90 minutes. So overall, radio is handled pretty well on the HD mini.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini is among the louder handsets we have tested recently but fortunately that does not come at the price of increased distortions. On the contrary, the audio output of the WinMo handset is very good overall, with no major weaknesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response of the handset keeps within the +-1 dB limit with ease for the whole range and the noise levels are excellent. The same holds true for the dynamic range and the stereo crosstalk of the HD mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the HD mini performance for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player hasn?t heard of DivX<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HD mini comes with the standard - and sadly underperforming - Windows Media Player. It only manages mp4 and 3gp and for DivX/XviD support you will need a third party application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching videos on the HD mini is enjoyable but videos will either have to be cropped or watched in a letterbox format ? and of course converted to a format that WMP can handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have also added their own video player but it only supports the video/audio codecs available to the Windows Media player in the first place. To enjoy a wider range of video options on the HD mini (DivX or XviD for example), you will probably need to purchase a dedicated video player with additional codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We made out traditional Core Player benchmarks with the HTC HD2 along and compared them with the HD mini. It managed to play D1 video without a hitch - all you have to do is keep the bitrate of the videos under 3Mbps and you'll be OK. The HVGA aspect of the screen is not ideal for movies though - 16:9 content will wither have to be cropped or watched in a letterbox format (and movies can be even wider).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP snapper needs further tweaking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini has a 5 megapixel auto focus camera producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. It?s left bare without a flash. The camera offers an intuitive user interface and shoots in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It lacks a dedicated camera key, but autofocus is handled the iPhone way ? it automatically refocuses whenever you move the device. Once focus is locked, you can take the picture by pressing the virtual capture button. There is touch-focus too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on the settings, the viewfinder is cropped to full the entire screen or there?s a black strip on the right. The second option has its advantages ? you can see the entire scene and the black strip is where the two constantly visible controls are (they can?t be hidden).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera features, the HTC HD mini has the usual and offers the standard self-timer, white balance presets, ISO settings (up to ISO800), effects and a viewfinder gridline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can shoot geo-tagged photos too, thanks to the GPS Photo mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD mini doesn?t have a dedicated macro mode, but most times it manages to focus in close-ups. Some photos come out well, others are out of focus, but there?s nothing that can be done about it ? except maybe forcing it to refocus (by moving the phone) and taking another shot, just in case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is somewhat disappointing ? the photos have OK detail levels and colors are fine, though on the dull side. But the contrast definitely could have been higher and for some reason the HD mini underexposes all photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using an image editing program, you can brighten up dark areas (some of which are so dark that you can?t make out anything), but nothing can bring back all the lost detail in the shadows.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the HTC HD mini. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there?s a hint of a pink spot, but nowhere near as eye-poking as it used to be on the HD2 (they patched that).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video capturing capabilities of the HTC HD mini are unimpressive ? they max out at CIF@25 frames. The bitrate of the videos is low, which leaves more compression artifacts than details. Switching between H.264 and MPEG-4 in the settings menu didn?t improve the situation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 26 Apr: It turns out that the HD mini is capable of recording VGA videos @ 30fps, but only when the MPEG4 codec is selected. Unfortunately there's not too great of improvement in the overall quality as compression is still excessive and neither contrast nor color rendering is impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the new sample video captured in VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder resembles that of the still camera. You can only adjust the white balance, resolution, brightness and finally add some color effects.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity to match the HD2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity the HTC HD mini is an equal to the HD2 - HSDPA 7.2Mbps, HSUPA 2Mbps, Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth + EDR. Wi-Fi support is limited to b/g, which is something to consider if you use the n standard at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD mini has quad-band GSM support and dual-band 3G - 900 and 2100 MHz bands are supported (that is Europe and the like - you?re welcome to check out our Worldwide GSM Network Bands distribution database).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 connections are supported as well, through a microUSB port rather than ExtUSB, which is featured on most HTC phones. When connected to a computer, the HD mini prompts you to select among ActiveSync, Mass Storage or Modem mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack for the audio purists is also onboard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser ? IE wins over Opera, just barely<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, Opera is the browser of choice for HTC ? it comes preinstalled on the HD mini. But the default browser is still the Internet Explorer Mobile 6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key advantage of IE Mobile over Opera is Flash ? and the key disadvantage was lack of pinch zoom, which has been sorted. However, there are still problems with IE Mobile. Anyway, since both are preinstalled, you can choose the one that best suits you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile 6 is nicely touch optimized, unlike its predecessors, and the on-screen controls are as unobtrusive as possible. Usually, there?s just one button in the lower-right corner (it hides while you?re panning), which brings up all the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting the two browsers side to side, it?s easy to see that IE Mobile has borrowed a lot from the UI design. And that?s a good thing ? Opera has a great interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However Internet Explorer Mobile 6, as much as it has improved over time, still has a few faults that will keep people using Opera instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, load times on Opera are easily 30 percent lower. Also, IE Mobile can?t handle multiple tabs, but Opera can handle three at a time. IE Mobile has minor rendering problems ? it will sometimes cause problems, but not too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What is more, IE?s Flash support is not all roses ? YouTube videos worked, but Vimeo and DailyMotion videos didn?t. We also had problems with Flash games (out of memory, old Flash Player, etc.). Since there?s a dedicated app for YouTube (which has a more usable UI), Flash support is not a huge point in its favor after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mobile has a very compact interface too ? and while it skimps on Flash, it has several features that can be very helpful. Saving the current page (IE can save pages too, but only from a link to that page, which is either inconvenient or impossible), searching on a page, a download manager and, of course, up to three pages open at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing Opera has over IE is text reflow. After you zoom in or out, lines of text are adjusted to fit exactly the width of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both browsers support auto-rotation, and while both are reasonably fast, Opera Mobile needs noticeably less time to redraw ? wherever you scroll, there?s no sight of the placeholder pattern, that fills in the blanks until that part of the page is rendered. IE Mobile needs a noticeable second to fill in the blanks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The organizer we like the most<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with Outlook. On the HD mini, the standard interface is kept under wraps at all times. Even creating a new event (which in the HD2 was done via the non-modified UI) is nicely skinned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly views. All of them are available in the Sense UI, but the left context key allows you to switch only between the monthly and agenda views. For the others you will need to go to the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding an appointment is easy and you can do it by the dedicated button. It has plenty of fields, reminders and notes. The time settings resemble the iPhone clock wheels, which LG already adopted in their S-Class UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing tasks, you can also see weather information for that particular day if available. The Sense UI preloads the weather forecast for up to 5 days ahead of the last update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority; the Notes also come in handy (though both are untouched by Sense UI). The Voice recorder and Calculator need no explanation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the limited customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some of the free third-party alternatives.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A document editor is readily available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are pleased with the performance of the HD mini in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on handhelds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four viewers support pinch-zooming (yey!) but there?s still no auto-rotation. So, you?re stuck with portrait orientation ? the 3.2? screen still fits a decent amount of text though. When you bring up the keyboard to enter text however, it?s a different deal ? you only have about 20% of the screen left to view the document. That?s not sufficient for anything but minor edits.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps and stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini comes with plenty of preloaded applications: an MP3 Trimmer, HTC Peep, Facebook, Wi-Fi Router, World Card Mobile, a YouTube application and a Streaming Media manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager on the HD mini is the standard Windows Mobile one and won't surprise anyone ? it has the full functionality you need. The phone offers a small amount of user available storage - about 160MB available to the user. This is barely sufficient and you'll definitely find yourself needing a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Streaming Media manager allows access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook and Peep are the official mobile apps for accessing the popular social networks of Facebook and Twitter. You can do almost everything with them - change status, write posts, upload photos or organize albums, stay connected to your friends and all that stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned before, there is complete Facebook integration with the new phonebook. When you link a Facebook profile to a contact you can view its status message, updates and online albums directly in the Contact manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Peep works directly in the Twitter tab, so you won't need to run it from the Start menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi router allows you to share your HSPA connection to other Wi-Fi enabled devices such as a mobile computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WorldCard Mobile is a business card scanner. You can capture cards, and then edit or save them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC HD mini also ships with the MP3 Trimmer app. It allows you to crop MP3 tracks to make your own ringtones. Another goodie is the Remote Desktop Mobile client. It allows you to connect remotely to any PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that has become a part of the HTC experience is the well-known Teeter game. The game is simple - by tilting the phone, you must guide a ball through various mazes avoiding trap holes along the way. The other game that came with the HD mini is the classic timewaster, Solitaire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube application is here again. It offers a fluid, excellent looking interface - shinier than even the iPhone's.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows Mobile has a Marketplace too, needs cheaper apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini comes with the Microsoft Marketplace (it?s not preinstalled, but installs the first time you run it). It?s simple to use and should be the first place you check when you need an app, but it?s not as good as the iPhone and Android stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty straightforward - it gives you shortcuts to the most popular applications, the most recent ones and category view. There is of course a search box too to make things easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each app in the Marketplace there are user reviews, screenshots and, as usual, individual ratings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of apps has grown significantly since Marketplace launched ? we counted 688. Nowhere near App Store or Android Market numbers. There are free apps but they?re rare ? most apps cost 1 or 2 US dollars but there are $10 and even $30 ones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Embedded GPS, CoPilot Live 8 trial to whet your appetite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini features a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi, the 2G/3G network or via ActiveSync for a much faster satellite lock. It can be done in seconds thanks to a handy tool in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD mini comes with a trial version of CoPilot Live 8 and the free Google Maps. The 3.2? screen of the HD mini is good enough for navigation, but its no match for dedicated SatNav units or the HD2. Anyway, you have 15 days to test the CoPilot Live and decide if the HD mini can do the full-time job of an in-car SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing about CoPilot Live 8 is that it allows you to download the whole map for your region so you don't need to download it over the wireless network on the go. Maps are downloaded on the memory card, so the limited internal storage is not a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chip sensitivity of the HTC HD mini is reasonable but not great ? after downloading A-GPS data, it took about 40 seconds to get a lock. Both CoPilot 8 and Google Maps have multi-touch support, while the double tap works only in the Gmaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini comes with Google Maps 3.3.1, which adds digital compass support, but the mini doesn?t have one, so you can?t use that feature. Gmaps can also plan routes, but it doesn?t have voice commands. It is also completely reliable on Google?s servers for map data, so you?d need a data plan ? you can?t preload the data.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD mini is pretty much what a modern-day smartphone should be all about. We are not talking the ultimate of technology, a ridiculously expensive piece of gear to flash around and impress everyone around. We mean a handy working tool that can also keep you entertained.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much more pocket-friendly than the HTC HD2, the HD mini offers a comparable (although admittedly inferior) performance at a lower price. It?s the ultimate speed and power against the friendly appearance and cheery attitude. It?s a matter of priorities of course, but the HD mini can be a pretty good deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense UI has done well to cover the WinMo user interface shortcomings and the capacitive multi-touch display adds value to the whole package. The youthful design (just not as childish as we?ve seen XpressMusic get) seems well suited to the target audience too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is, yet again, pricing is just steeper than most of the competing smartphone platforms out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero will gladly deliver for far less cash, while the HTC Legend will throw in AMOLED for the same asking price. The Galaxy Spica is also a comparable package within the same price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Hero ? HTC Legend ? Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X6 16 GB has had its price tag duly corrected and 16 gigs of internal memory do sound tempting. The Symbian touch user interface is nowhere near the Sense UI standards though, and the X6 CPU and RAM are less impressive. The Finn offers higher screen resolution and the audio quality to go with the XpressMusic background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia X6 16GB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Within the very same PocketPC ranks, the HTC Touch Diamond2 will tempt you with WVGA resolution if you can live without the multi-touch capacitive screen. It comes with an earlier version of the OS and the Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Diamond2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia II will take this offer to the next step by adding a much larger 3.7? AMOLED display, D1 video and faster CPU. Sorry for stating the obvious but the Omnia II will give you much more bang for your buck. It?s fair to note though, these two are not competing for the same kind of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Omnia II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC HD mini is a great idea overall, and it has the advantage of packing the latest software available. The disadvantage is having to compete with too many equal (and stronger) rivals in the same price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Value for money is not its strongest point, and it doesn?t get any better when you put WinPho 7 in the picture. What we now know as Windows Mobile 6.5 will become Windows Phone Starter edition. No need to tell you Windows Phone 7 will be the pet project and the starter edition will be the entry-level alternative. We can only guess what the implications will be for the level of support ? and we cannot say Microsoft are doing such a good job of it even now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, with that bit of warning, is the HTC HD mini good to go? We?d still say yes. Not because we did our job and it?s your responsibility henceforth. There?s just something about this kiddo.</paragraph>
