			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W960 is aptly the big gun in the Sony Ericsson portfolio of music-centered handsets. Gifted with the scorching 8GB of storage space and a large touchscreen TFT display, a 3-megapixel camera, Wi-Fi and 3G capabilities, the W960 easily stands out in the Walkman crowd. Powered by the Symbian OS and UIQ user interface, it delivers one-of-a-kind Walkman experience with rich fullscreen visualizations and advanced track filtering. All this is enough to have us drooling over the specs sheet, eager to get our hands on this smarty Walkman and see what it's made of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 is the successor of Sony Ericsson W950, which came with 4GB of integrated memory, but failed to gain popularity for the lack of camera and Wi-Fi capabilities. In fact, featurewise the W960 resembles more the Sony Ericsson P1 - they are almost identical in terms of hardware (although the P1 has an Infrared port, which lacks in W960). The W960 features the same 208MHz processor and the same amount of RAM - 128MB. However, the W960 boasts a dedicated Walkman key, three touch-sensitive keys for controlling the music player and, finally, that all-important Walkman home screen application with fullscreen visualizations. You probably are as excited as we are about this review, so let's not waste any more time and get on to it, shall we?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W960 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First encounter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we first saw the W960 on the Sony Ericsson product shots, we thought it was gorgeous. Truth is, it doesn't look that good in person - in fact, it looks cheaper than it really is. But hey, it's just us - don't let us ruin your pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W960 measures pretty much the same as the W950 or the P1 smartphone - 109 x 55 x 16 mm and it weighs 119 g. That's not much really, considering the handset's rich functionality. The dominating solemn black color of the casing contrasts with a sporty white edging along all sides. The front panel design is rather minimalist. At the top, above the display, you can see the video-call camera and the earpiece. Below the screen, there is a row of hidden touch-sensitive keys, which light up once you start the Walkman music player. The keypad comes in conservative design and colors, unlike most other Walkman handsets, that tend to be flashier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device is the one that caught us quite off guard. Somehow, a key we are so used to, has gone missing. On all previous Sony Ericsson smartphones, a Back key has always been present right next to the traditional Jog Wheel. Now, the only place the users will find that key is on the front keypad. Next to the Jog wheel, you can easily see the neck/wrist strap eyelet, styled in silver. The stylus compartment is right next to this eyelet. The stylus itself has a rather innovative design - not telescopic this time and entirely made of plastic, it comes with a rather sporty design and... has a dreaded removable tip. Used to have, to be more precise. After taking these shots, the removable tip made us scour the office floor in a vain search - it had obviously fallen off and was nowhere to be found. Seems like a truly clumsy solution by Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the W960 features only two volume keys and the camera shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the handset hosts the On/Off key, which is also used for switching between Normal and Flight mode. The bottom side features the proprietary Fast port and the microphone pinhole. You probably won't be able to see it but just above the Fast port there is a lighter strip that is in fact a status LED. It blinks in red when the battery is empty, and it gets lit up in green when you charge the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Sony Ericsson W960 is made of black matt plastic. A stylishly looking ring of brushed metal encircles the 3-megapixel camera lens. It also hosts the dual-LED flash. Right next to it is the loudspeaker grill (by the way, anyone got a spare W960 stylus?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Po battery is revealed once you remove the back cover. It has a capacity of 900 mAh and the manufacturer promises up to 370 h of standby time and up to 9 h of talk time. These times seem rather optimistic. In reality, the battery lasted around 4 full days hooked to a 3G network. We didn't do a thorough music playback battery test, but Sony Ericsson claim the W960 should provide up to 27 hours of music playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Usability breakdown<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Using the Sony Ericsson W960 in everyday scenarios like making calls, managing contacts and listening to music was a pleasant task. We do miss the side Back button, which enabled single-handed operation of the interface. There is of course a software Back key, but it's hardly usable in combination with the Jog wheel, especially for left-handed users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is comfortable to use and keys provide nice tactile feedback. That of course does not hold true for the touch-sensitive keys. All keys have a rather uneven white backlighting (it does seem bluish on the photos, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TFT display on the W960 is pretty much the same as the displays used in recent Sony Ericsson smartphones. It has a 2.6" diagonal, supports 262K colors and works in QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) resolution. As it is transreflective, it does well under bright sunlight, but colors and contrast look a bit washed out in most situations, compared to regular Sony Ericsson feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As anyone could expect, W960 offers nice signal reception and we found no problems during calls. The vibration is on a medium level, while the ringing volume is more than enough to alert you of incoming calls even in a noisy setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Sony Ericsson W960 ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our new speakerphone loudness test. More info on our test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Symbian UIQ<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 interface is UIQ 3.0 - a customizable stylus-based user interface for mobile phones, based on the Symbian 9.1 OS. The interface is the same one used in previous Sony Ericsson smartphones such as the W950, the P990, and the P1. With W960 however, the Walkman functionality is on focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the biggest update is the ability to change the well-known Today screen with a Walkman one. When the player is inactive, you have a big Walkman shortcut right in the middle of the screen. Once you get your music playlist rolling, the home screen will visualize every detail about the currently running track plus its album art. The most definite eye-catcher of all is the fullscreen visualizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking our eyes off the player (a bit of a challenge, really) we must duly note that the home screen also offers information on time, date, signal strength and battery meter and, of course, there is the customizable shortcuts bar. It can hold up to 15 different shortcuts to your favorite features. The shortcuts bar is cleverly only a touch away, so that it doesn't consume the precious screen real estate (much like on Sony Ericsson P1). The shortcut items have large graphic icons, aptly sized for finger touching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about the new home screen is that the old one is still an option when you use your smartphone to run everyday jobs. In case you opt for it, the Today screen will display the current Calendar events, messages and emails, missed calls, general notes, etc. With the Today screen on, the four top shortcuts of the bar we mentioned earlier appear at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the standby screen, there are two pop-up menus. The first one can is launched by pressing the More softkey and the second one can be opened by touching the triangle in the upper left corner. While some of their functions overlap, the first one offers the option to turn on a connectivity feature, change the ringtone volume, view the smartphone status, and allows access to a call management option for filtering incoming calls. It's here that you can also access the Task manager. The other pop-up gives you access to the most important items or actions you may need or like to do - for example, you can again turn on connectivity options such as Bluetooth or WLAN, make a new call, add a new contact or put down some appointments and notes. Furthermore, it gives you access to the dual time zone clock and allows you to control the volume level for different events centrally. We are very pleased with this menu, as it allows quick access to the most important functions of any smartphone. The only downside is that it's only accessible with the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice thing is that the smartphone has a dedicated Flight mode, which can be turned seamlessly on without restarting the phone. Starting the handset directly into Flight mode is another option, which you get prompted about every time you power it on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu of the Sony Ericsson W960 allows two different views: icon grid and list view. The font throughout the user interface is rather small, except for the file manager, messaging and phonebook, where you can choose between there different font sizes. The smartphone interface is customizable through various graphic themes - unfortunately, ours had only the default Walkman one preinstalled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Make contact<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 offers an extensive phonebook designed to suit everybody's needs. It can store unlimited amount of numbers. You can choose to filter your contacts by groups or by saving location; and group them into individual folders, which you can later use for call management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The details you can save for a given contact are plenty and include several numbers and email addresses, job title, office and home postal addresses and voice commands for the different phone numbers of the contact. Finally, you can associate a ringtone and a picture to a specific contact. There is a field to enter the contact's birthday and the entered date gets synced with the Calendar. Much like the smartphones based on S60 user interface, you can add your own custom fields here, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Call log lists store all the information about the calls received or made. Now, when it comes to call management, besides call filtering there are two other nice things that the W960 can do for you. The first one is sending an SMS with a predefined text to the person whose call you are rejecting. The second one is automatically storing a callback event in the calendar every time you reject a call. In case you opt for that, you can set how many minutes after the call the call back reminder should appear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A touch of messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Usually the messaging department is among the strengths of any smartphone. Sony Ericsson W960 is not an exception to the rule. It offers rich functions combined with several text-input options. You can enter text using a virtual on-screen QWERTY keyboard or simply handwrite with the stylus on the touchscreen display. As regards handwriting recognition, the phone manages very well. The Sony Ericsson W960 also offers an enhanced version of the T9 dictionary - its thesaurus is expandable - you can add your own words and it can even remember whole messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All messages share one inbox. The supported types are SMS, EMS, MMS, and RSS feeds. The last one is available through a dedicated application. Emails have their own separate Inbox for every single account. Composing messages is nice and easy with the different input methods available. Use of emoticons is enabled, should you feel short on words. The font size can vary according to your needs. A lot of editing options are at your disposal, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is not really a separate application. It has extensive options but setting it up to work with your email account is quite easy. It supports the POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols, as well as SSL and TLS encryption. The W960 has support for various push email providers - the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync comes preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing an email is as simple as writing a standard SMS. By default, the client downloads only the email headers or you can set it up to automatically download entire messages if they don't exceed a predefined KB limit. Adding an attachment is easy as usual - all you have to do is open the corresponding tab in the "new email" editor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scouring the internals<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 has 160MB of flash memory available to the user. There are additional 8GB of storage space, which are supposed to make the absence of a card slot self explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone offers a nice file manager, which looks a lot like the file manager interface of Sony Ericsson non-OS phones. It has two tabs - one showing the folders in the main memory (160MB) and another one showing the files and folders on the flash memory (8GB). You can mark multiple files or folders and then copy, move or send them to another device. There is support for DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing through pictures though, is much easier with the Picture gallery application. It offers almost the same folder and file structure as the file manager but it has some additional options as along with several view settings. You can browse the pictures in portrait or landscape mode. You can also set whether the pictures in portrait mode should be viewed fullscreen. When browsing in landscape mode, the fullscreen is the only available option. Of course, you can zoom in the pictures to their original size and even more. When zooming, a mini-map appears which allows you to see which picture area you are looking at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a picture editor that allows you to do quick editing on selected pictures. You can adjust stuff like brightness, contrast, intensity or color balance, and you can further apply several color effects to the images such as solarize, sepia, black and white or negative. Additionally, you can warp or emboss images and you can add text or clipart to them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Walkman inspired<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W960 boasts one of the most elaborate music players we have seen in a mobile phone. Of course, it supports playlists with shuffle and loop options, while offering the usual equalizer presets including the Walkman MegaBass. The dedicated music player key on the keypad, along with the touch-sensitive multimedia keys, that come alive once you've started the player, offer great user-friendliness - not that we would expect any less when a Walkman-branded mobile is in question. The touch-sensitive keys react to every touch, no matter if it's your fingers or some other object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much as with W950, you can sort all your music by using the Rating and Mood categories. First, you can add ratings to the songs and then filter the available tracks by their rating. Mood is another label you can add to your tracks, allowing you to subsequently filter songs and listen only to those that suit your current mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The track filtering is advanced enough with artist, album, compilations, playlists and auto playlists available as options. The auto playlists deserve special attention - you can have the handset dynamically create playlists based on rules such as top rated tracks, most played tracks, latest additions, tracks from a specific year or decade, bookmarked tracks, least played, or last played tracks. Unfortunately, the player doesn't use the actual file names for filtering, but the ID3 tags only. So, if there are some tracks that do not have their ID3 tags set up correctly, the filtering lists them as unknown and they are left out of their respective albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Track searching is also available by using a dedicated box in the bottom left corner. It can accept even handwriting, if you have set it to be your default input method.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already said, the greatest innovation is the addition of several fullscreen background visualizations. They change in speed and patterns according to the mood label your current track has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player also offers a sleep timer allowing it to turn off automatically after a user-defined period. One of the coolest things about the player is the option to scroll through your tracks using the side Jog Dial: a lot easier than on any feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external speaker of Sony Ericsson W960 provides a nice listening experience - nothing less than what one would expect in a Walkman phone. The speaker manages a very soft and pleasant sound, though lacking ample bass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we cannot rely on our audio quality test for determining the quality of the sound produced by the Fast port. It seems that our test unit (being a pre-release one) has a sound equalizer setting that is permanently on and cannot be turned off manually. It seems to be suppressing the low frequencies, while pumping up the high ones. So it produced a rather strange frequency response graph that cannot be compared to other handsets. Anyways you can have a look at it as well as have a peek at the other numbers that we collected through analysis. More on our audio quality test can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial comment: The review of the Sony Ericsson W960 was written before the handset had become market available. At this pre-release stage the Sony Ericsson HBH-DS220 stereo Bluetooth headset adaptor was to be offered as a standard accessory in the W960 retail package, however later on Sony Ericsson dropped it from the accessories list. The Sony Ericsson HBH-DS220 stereo Bluetooth headset adaptor is now available as an optional accessory, which can be bought separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, an intriguing accessory of the W960 is the Sony Ericsson HBH-DS220 stereo Bluetooth headset adaptor. You get a Bluetooth adapter to plug in your very own third-party headphones. The sound quality is nice and they easily receive signal from as far as 7 m, when no obstacles are in the way. We really liked the sound reproduction when listening through third-party regular headphones. The headset adaptor has a clever miniature charging port that uses a regular Sony Ericsson charger. In terms of battery life the Bluetooth adaptor naturally scores differently when used with large home stereo headphones and small ear plugs. The music volume levels are also of importance. In our case of listenig to music with large headphones and high volume levels the Bluetooth adaptor lasted 2-3 hours of constant music playback with a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video Player application offers nice functionality. You can watch your videos in landscape mode at fullscreen view. The W960 has support for streaming H.264 video content, so you can surely watch high-quality online TV on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo FM radio that the Sony Ericsson W960 is equipped with supports RDS and can store up to 20 radio stations. If the radio station broadcasts RDS data, it will get automatically stored in the phone memory with its name. The fullscreen visualizations used in the music player are available here as well, although with the FM radio you can choose their colors instead of relying on the mood ratings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio is equipped with the TrackID function, which records several seconds of a song you are listening to, matches it against Gracenote's server database and returns the name and artist. As we have seen in so many other Sony Ericsson phones, the service is reliable in around 50% of the cases.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We finally got a camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 is equipped with a 3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus and a dual-LED flash - again, much like the P1 and unlike the previous Walkman-enabled smartphone W950. The maximum resolution is 2048 x 1536 pixels. Pictures are taken by holding the handset in landscape mode. The camera interface is intuitive - all settings are arranged in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the snappy camera interface reminds a lot of the interface of the latest Sony Ericsson phones, with its similar graphics and functions. There are three quality levels and the camera has a full automatic exposure control, while offering nice manual overexposure control accessible from the main viewfinder interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The autofocus settings of the camera feature a dedicated macro mode. You can even turn the autofocus off and use a fixed focal length for even faster snapshots. The camera offers automatic white balance but there are four custom white balance presets to choose from, depending on the environment. You can apply several color effects to the pictures and video, such as Black &amp; white, Sepia, Solarization and Negative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will refrain from much comment on the picture quality, as we're convinced that the final, retail version of the smartphone will have the camera quality improved. Our unit (being a pre-release one) produced images with very high contrast and sharpness. So we don't find our samples satisfactory, so we'll not publish full-size shots. Instead, we post some of the better images downsampled to 1024 x 768 pixels. We expect that when launched, Sony Ericsson W960 will produce images as good as the Sony Ericsson P1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like previous smartphones, the Sony Ericsson W960 can capture video with a maximum resolution of 320 x 240 pixels at 15 fps. There are S60 mobile phones on the market capable of recording video in VGA resolution at 30 fps while providing full smartphone capabilities. Obviously, QVGA and the low frame rate are somewhat of a downer. Lower resolutions (such as QCIF - 176 x 144) though, allow recording at 30 fps but the picture details are far than adequate. All videos are recorded in 3GP format. The video recording times (no matter what the resolution), are limited by the available memory only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That sort of a video capturing is a serious downside for a smartphone intended to be an all-in-one multimedia device such as Sony Ericsson W960.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample video (Download size: 570KB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the front VGA video-call camera was easy since it offers a rather intuitive interface. A nice thing is that you can use the rear main camera in video calls too, meaning you can easily show the other party your surroundings. The video-call camera also has a dedicated Night mode. Generally, when it comes to video calls, the W960 Video phone application manages well enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>On the Fast Track<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connecting the Sony Ericsson W960 smartphone to a computer or other devices, you have various options. You can use a USB cable or the Bluetooth 2.0 functionality. Connecting the smartphone to a PC via the Bluetooth worked like a charm. Of course, the Bluetooth capabilities of the device include support for the A2DP profile, which allows you to use a stereo Bluetooth headset for listening to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connecting the handset via the USB cable was hassle-free and the 8GB of flash memory appeared as a removable drive in Windows Explorer, much like your regular flash drive would. We are satisfied with the transfer speeds reachable with this connection. Using Windows Vista the upload transfer speed reached around 7.5MB/s, not bad at all. That would mean you could easily fill up those 8GB with tracks in less than 20 minutes. What's even better is that the phone gets charged while it's connected to the PC. If you decide to use the device as a portable storage, you can enjoy even faster download transfer speeds - our tests showed up to 16MB/s!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson are said to have developed new PC software for transferring music to your handset. The first models to ship with it should be K850 and W960. It is called Sony Ericsson Media Manager but at the time of writing of this review, it was still unavailable. However, with it users should be able to make better use of the tracks' Mood label in the latest Sony Ericsson music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization with the PC or remote server via SyncML also works seamlessly. The user can choose items to be synchronized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 has tri-band GSM/UMTS support (GSM 900/1800/1900) and supports GPRS for fast data transfers in non-3G enabled networks. EDGE support lacks here, as it does in previous smartphones. HSDPA would have been welcome, as it's getting rather wide spread these days, but unfortunately Sony Ericsson chose not to support it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the W960 comes with Wi-Fi support, as opposed to the W950. The integrated connection manager does pretty well with the available connections. For example, when you have several connectivity accounts available at the same time, such as Bluetooth, WLAN and UMTS, you can set priority for their usage. This is something that S60 smartphones are unable to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 comes equipped with the Opera 8.0 Web browser, which has made a reputation as one of the best in mobile devices. It supports HTML, XHTML, JavaScript, frames, CSS, and TSL and SSL security protocols. It's not on par with the Nokia web browser but it surely renders pages fast enough and offers rich view options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users can quickly and easily switch between portrait and landscape modes as well as change from a windowed view to a fullscreen view. We found the portrait fullscreen view to suit our liking best. Furthermore, you can use the Text mode option to reformat pages to exclude pictures and thus save some of those precious megabytes your network carrier charges you for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is the Find option, which allows you to search a text string in the page you have opened. You can hardly see that in other mobile browsers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plan ahead<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the Time application, we already wrote about. It is nothing special really but it does its job more than all right. You can set a ringtone of your choice as an Alarm sound, or you can have a radio station wake you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the Calendar application is at a decent level. You can choose between monthly, weekly and daily view and two time zones. The available events that you can store are Appointment, Reminder, All day event, and Anniversary. Birthdays can be set as Anniversary events, since those have automatic annual repetition. There are a lot of user-configurable options at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any Sony Ericsson phone, you have two other applications to organize your daily routine: the Tasks and Notes applications. Tasks allow you to enter simple events, which do not require extensive setup as the ones in Calendar. The Notes application allows saving short notes as the name itself implies. The interesting thing here is that the notes can be in handwritten form.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W960 also offers a nicely designed Calculator, Unit converter and a Sound Recorder with a recording time only limited by the available memory. Sony Ericsson has decided to ditch the MusicDJ application seen on almost all of their mobile phones - it allows you to create polyphonic ringtones within a simple user interface. For an unknown reason, the VideoDJ application seen on some of the latest Sony Ericsson mobiles, also lacks here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe this is the most appropriate place to say a few things about the Task Manager, which is something of a separate application, although fully integrated into the OS. The Task Manager icon is available in the upper right angle of the screen almost throughout the whole smartphone interface. You probably have noticed that on almost all of our screenshots. Unfortunately, the icon itself is so small that the only way to press it is by using the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task Manager has two tabs - the first and default one, which you see whenever you open the Manager contains shortcuts to the Main Menu and the Standby, as well as access to the recently used applications. The second tab of the Task Manager contains all the currently running applications and allows you to terminate them - unfortunately only one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 also comes with the Quickoffice application, allowing it to open and even edit MS Word, MS Excel and MS Powerpoint documents. The PDF+ application allows reading PDF files. However, it renders PDF files excessively slowly - not anything like the Acrobat Reader LE we saw in Nokia E61i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson W960 had no games installed whatsoever, but we are sure this is a unit-specific issue and that the retail version would at least have a title or two for you to enjoy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Summing it up, the Sony Ericsson W960 easily offers more than any other Sony Ericsson Walkman before. Positive changes compared to the W950 are noticeable both in system performance and in the hardware equipment. In terms of software, the handset is identical to the previous UIQ 3 mobiles and, when compared to Nokia S60 smartphones, loses only on VoIP capabilities, which are much more elaborate in the latest S60 mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest controversy as we see it, when making the purchase decision for W960, lies in the use of a touchscreen interface for a regular smartphone. Our opinion is that a smartphone interface should be either optimized for finger touching or the screen should not be touch sensitive at all. Pulling the stylus out for anything except handwriting on the screen is not justifiable. So, just to put it shortly, the W960 would have been a great choice if it had some sort of a D-pad to allow easy single-handed navigation through the menu options without the need for stylus all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we find the Sony Ericsson W960 a great choice for all you music fans that don't mind using both hands for operating their handset.</paragraph>
