			<paragraph>Motorola ROKR E1 seems to be a new and quite progressive mobile. Well, it is not really new, as it takes its roots in the older E398 model, but it does brings a sure novelty: a direct cooperation with the iTunes program as well as with one of the world's biggest music dealers via internet - iTunes Music Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In cooperation with Apple, Motorola has launched an old-new mobile phone, called ROKR E1. It is the first mobile phone to support the iTunes Music Store service, one of the world's biggest internet music stores. Until now common Apple iPod MP3 have been the only devices to freely cooperate with iTunes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola and Apple started working together more than a year ago, in July 2004. The result of their cooperation was first presented at the CES fair at the beginning of this year. Soon afterwards, in the spring of 2005, we were shown the first pictures of their new music phone. And here we have it - the result, Motorola ROKR E1. Yet, we expect our experienced readers to stay calm, for the new Motorola is almost identical to the one year-old E398 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    ROKR's snowy white color version </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As there are very few differences between the mentioned old model and the current new one, I think that a review with an extended and detailed description is not necessary. Instead, you may want to have a look straight at the detailed review of Motorola E398. In this article I will pay attention to the phone's most important characteristics and will go deeper in description of the music player's work, its reproduction quality as well as the comfort of applying iTunes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Changes visible at first glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Provided you were attracted by the design of the dark Motorola E398, the new model will make you feel euphoric. The combination of white and matt silver goes well with the design of iPod models. The color combination is far from new. Yet, I am quite willing to forgive Motorola this lack of originality. What's more, I give it the best mark possible, for Motorola has proved that the way colors are combined can transform impersonal grey into one of the most attractive mobile phones on the current market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In my review on the E398 model I was complaining about the accentuated model logo positioned behind the transparent rubber in the bottom part of the phone. I was not the only one to raise a voice of dislike and as you can see, the manufacturer has heard the customers' opinion and has made the necessary modifications. The new model is equipped with a descent Motorola logo, hidden behind a rubber strip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    ROKR E1 in a palm and compared with a credit card </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both sides of the phone are decorated with notable ribbing, which hides two stereophonic speakers. Here you will also find phone's color diodes. These, however, are made to serve for fun, called clubbing light only. It is basically a combination of colors and music, which reacts to loud rhythm impulses. What is a real pity is that these lights cannot be used as alerts for incoming calls and messages, as it is in the M55 Siemens model, for example. Correction: They can be used for alerts too - to activate the lights, just go to the Main menu, Settings, Ring styles, Event Lights and select 'On'. Make sure you select your desire Ring Lights pattern at the Ring Lights section. (Thanks, Jason).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Accentuated ribbing on both sides of the phone hides diodes and speakers </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I do like Motorola ROKR's design. The new color version has inspired a brand new style into the one-year old model. Is there anybody at all whom this phone's design seems old-fashioned?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Better display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the new ROKR is a novelty. It shows 262K colors. In comparison, the old E398 model was able to view 65K only. I must confess, however, that I would have not noticed the difference if I had not written the technical information on the new Motorola. In any case, the top-quality that was established by the previous model has been maintained in ROKR E1 too: colors are perfectly vivid; display is easy to read in direct sunlight. Resolution of 176 x 220 pixels on a relatively small surface ensures finesse and clearness of al graphics and texts. In other words, Motorola's display is brilliant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A thousand and one keys<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are more than 20 keys on ROKR's surface. Let's count together: 10 number keys, 2 keys with receivers, a five-way control key, 4 keys placed below the display, 2 volume control keys placed on the sides and 2 more keys on the sides that serve the camera. The phone is literally snowed under with keys. Even though this logically results in a slightly unusual method of control, with time you will surely get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The quantity of keys placed on the front side of the phone; with time you will get used to them </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric keypad buttons are made of plastic. They move accurately and have an easy-to-recognize reaction. You may find it difficult to orientate by touching only, for the keypad is united into a block. A bit more interesting are the keys below the display. The two marginal ones serve phone's software. The second key from the left starts the iTunes player. The second from the right opens the context menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The display of Motorola ROKR E1 is simply perfect </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphic design of the main menu depends on you and nobody else. You can choose between traditional icons and more clearly readable text descriptions. In addition you can move or group various items at your will.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook, phone calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Up to 1000 contacts can fit into ROKR's memory, each of which can be additionally assigned a number of tags. Each contact name can be sorted into a group and assigned a picture or a ringing melody. The phone book is accessed through the main menu or by a short key: each way of the control key can be set up to provide you a shortcut access to a certain part of the phone. In addition, you can search into the phone book by more than one character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phone's camera lens is mounted on its backside </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones are very good quality. The sound is clear, pure and loud enough. To your will, you are free to use a loud handsfree set while phoning. The phone supports ringing profiles. When a call is coming in, the phone can alert you of an incoming phone by using a melody, a MP3 file or vibration. The sound that comes out of ROKR's two speakers is really loud, so the phone can be heard even in the loudest environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola ROKR E1 works with Bluetooth, so you will be able to use a wireless handsfree set. Thanks to Bluetooth you can manage files in the phone's memory, as well. Yet, the wireless transfer speed is much lower than the one a cable would provide you with, so I recommend you to transfer data wirelessly in urgent situations only.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>How to deal with SMS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ROKR E1 will definitely satisfy SMS fans. The phone is equipped with shared memory that allows for saving a huge number of messages. As for the writing process itself, my feelings are mixed: on one hand the phone features a big display, a comfortable keypad and a rich dictionary iTap; on the other hand it makes you wait for centuries before it lets you press the same key once again... Fortunately, the phone does not get significantly slow when a bigger amount of characters have been written.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Bottom side: what a pity that the manufacturers have not implemented a common mini-USB connector </paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS support is a matter of fact in a phone of this class. The built-in camera has not undergone any modifications since the E398 model - it still offers a maximum resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. It is regrettable though. In my opinion, all modern mobile phones cameras should be equipped with 1 megapixel at least. The phone offers a new video record application, with a maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels - much too poor, as obvious.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Extras and additional functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola supports GPRS class 10 data transfers and can be therefore used as a modem, connected through either Bluetooth, or a cable. The phone has a calendar with notes, calculator etc. ether. For leisure moments Motorola has prepared one game - the famous Java Worms. Within the memory you will find another application, which lets you save your personal data, like passwords, pin codes, login names etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Earphones get connected at the topside of the phone; the connector alone is protected by a rubber cap </paragraph>
			<paragraph>New ringing profiles, wallpapers or screen savers can be additionally downloaded in ROKR E1 through its file manager, thanks to its packed-in synchronizing cable and its easy-to-access memory. If you intent to do so, however, be prepared that phone's common speed will notably slow down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most important part of ROKR E1 is its memory card. In phone's original box you will find one of the TransFlash type with a capacity of 128 MB. The most specific characteristic of this type of memory cards is their miniature parameters, for they are no bigger than a man's smallest fingernail. The price of such a card is not exceptionally high either - you can get one for approximately ?50. Together with the memory card you are also given a TransFlash to SD/MMC adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Memory card and adapter, earphones and synchronizing cable </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In ROKR's original box you will also find a cable to connect the phone with a PC through USB port. This cable features one crucial disadvantage - when ROKR is in the middle of cooperation with PC, it does not allow you to charge it, nor does it let you plug the charger in. Besides, I would have appreciated a universal mini-USB connector, just like the one newer Motorola models are equipped with. If you happen to damage the cable, do not worry - substitutes are not expensive. Together with ROKR E1 you get a charge adapter for the net plug as well as a stereo handsfree.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Let the music play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola ROKR E1 has been made to serve as a full-function music player. To do so, however, it has had to use the know-how of Apple, and more precisely the service support of iTunes Music Store. The common price of a music file is ? 0.99. It is you, the customer, who should decide, whether it is or it is not a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Internet iTunes Music Store</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, Motorola ROKR has two music file players. One of them is the already mentioned iTunes. The other one is a standard music player, which was to be found in the E398 model. The former requires that the iTunes program be installed on a PC. If you find its installation unnecessary, you can skip this step. The phone supports the Mass Storage mode, so its card's file structure appears among other drives once the phone has been connected. You can then search the card and use the file manager options. Compared to iTunes however, the old player has a high number of disadvantages: i.e. after it has played the first music file it stops instead of continuing playing the rest of the files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iTunes in the computer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Installing iTunes on your PC seems to be a much more convenient solution. When you upload music into ROKR, music files get compressed into AAC format with a data rate of 128 kb/s. As a result, recorded files occupy approximately 1 MB per minute. This lets you save about 30 songs on a card with capacity of 128 MB. To my understanding, the compression does not appear to have influence on the quality of the music files. I need to stress, however, that I am writing this from the position of a common user, not as an expensively equipped audiophile. As matter of fact, I do not find any difference between the sound of ROKR's player (using the attached earphones) and the sound performed by my MP3 player on 192 kb/s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of iTunes application is quite simple, so you will get into it quickly. Don't worry - iTunes does not limit you to downloading music from iTunes Music Store only. You can direct it to you personal music-file archive and continue working. You may run into one serious problem though: untitled files as well as files, whose ID3Tag has not been filled in, appear as numbers only, so you will not know where to sort them. In other words, iTunes does not work with folders. It mixes up all files and then sorts them by file name, artist, title etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A list of the music pieces saved in ROKR </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have connected ROKR E1 to you computer, the phone appears in the iTunes program's left menu. Then you need to simply enter the music library, select the files you like and paste them into ROKR's folder. This way you start an automatic conversion from the PC into the mobile phone. Files are uploaded in a relatively low speed - about 170 KB/s. Curiously, reading is even slower - 110 KB/s. An overview of the phone's memory capacity is constantly displayed in the bottom part of the program. As far as I know, the most serious con of iTunes appears to be its slowness as well as the fact that it eats up a lot of memory space. Be prepared therefore for significant delays when you apply certain options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iTunes in the phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Using iTunes in the mobile phone alone is a simple task, as well. Files can be played by artist's name, album's title or music style. While listening to music, you can make any other common phone operation. Yet, keep in mind the delays, especially when you write SMS. What a pity that ROKR does not have a radio of at least basic characteristics. I am sure that many users would have appreciated it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    iTunes environment in the mobile phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sorting music by artist's name, playing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Player setup, capacity details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we have already loaded the music we wanted and there is nothing to stop us from enjoying it now. It can be listened to through the built-in stereo speakers, mounted on phone's sideways. Believe me or not, I tell you that no matter how small those speakers are, the sound they give out is superb. Pay attention to the earphones attached to the Motorola ROKR E1, for I am sure that they will provide you with even greater pleasure than the speakers. They can be used as a light handsfree set, as well. The earphones are connected through a 2.5 mm jack, so any other set of earphones, different from the one attached, will require reduction. Still, I think that most of you will do perfect with the original earphones. Even though their design is somewhat extravagant, their color suits the outlook of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Several views at Motorola ROKR </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the music depends on two main factors: the quality of the player and, of course, the quality of the earphones. In the case of Motorola ROKR, both factors work in perfect harmony. The earphones offer pleasant sound with good dynamics, steady base elements and reasonable middle heights. Quiet pieces of classical music, for example, are not disturbed by a single noise. Performance quality gets somewhat worse when the accumulator starts to get low. At the moment, when the phone alerts you that energy levels are low, music stops playing for a second or so.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life is a crucial factor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola ROKR uses Li-Ion accumulator with a capacity of 860 mAh. If the phone is used for common operations only, excluding listening to music, its accumulator endures about 2 to 3 days in a stand-by mode. However, if you listen to music during the day, at night you will have to charge it. ROKR E1 is able to constantly play music for about 12 hours - a really praiseworthy performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Will ROKR be a successful phone?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As a whole, iTunes application is a serious and important innovation in Motorola ROKR E1, especially due to the method, in which music files are compressed and managed. ROKR has occupied an especially advantageous position among mobile phones with built-in music player thanks to its excellent music performance and it top-class earphones. The lack of a radio is the only detail to regret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for ROKR's price, it is estimated at ? 230, a bit higher than the one of the current Motorola E398 model, which is ? 200.</paragraph>
