			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dragon in the HTC camp has awoken, ladies and gentlemen, and it's time it shows what it's capable of. Be it a dragon, or a lion, the HTC HD2, codenamed HTC Leo, is truly a spectacular device. It seems to have all modern mobile technologies in its pocket, bridging the gap between phones and tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC are pushing the boundaries of the impossible by fitting the 4.3-inch screen in a phone smaller than the Toshiba TG01, which was the first Snapdragon-based device ever to be released. HD2 is certainly a feat of engineering and something to really look up to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that it has just hit the market, the HD2 is bound to make some serious waves in the high-end smartphones pool and we guess many of you would probably be checking it out this holiday season. And you would be right to do so. Let's go over its impeccable specs sheet one more time:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC HD2 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 most certainly feels great in hand - the quality of the used materials is nice and the slim bezel around the screen is almost as spectacular as the slim profile. For the fist five minutes you can't help but simply sit there and just stare at the amazing screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But with touch smartphones getting screens that large sooner or later ergonomics had to be sacrificed. We somehow thought that the original Touch HD had almost crossed the line, but the HD2 has definitely crossed over. Reaching your thumb to the opposite angle of the screen is quite a task and it's not really comfortable to use the phone single-handedly. But we guess many of you would find the compromise with ergonomics quite worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page where we'll get into some unboxing action, and as part of this brief preview article we'll get into the ins and outs of HTC HD2 design and construction.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the HTC HD2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick unboxing video of the HTC HD2 that we shot at our office. We don't usually do unboxing videos in our reviews as usually several shots of the box contents are pretty much enough. But if you prefer having those instead of the images, let us know in the comments.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 makes a better first impression than its predecessor - the HTC Touch HD. It's not that the differences are so big, but the thin frame combined with an even larger display makes up for a pretty impressive combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit though that we liked the styling of the keys below the display better on the Touch HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is taken mainly by the 4.3" monster of a display of the HTC HD2. Sporting WVGA resolution, the screen is the largest we have ever seen on a mobile phone (the two HTC Advantage devices don't exactly qualify as mobile phones here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC HD2 is also the first among the WinMo family to use the capacitive touchscreen technology, which makes even the lightest of touches enough for a click to be registered. A stylus is no longer an option but on the large WVGA screen even the tiniest interface elements are easy to press with a finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hardly have any complaints about sensitivity and what's more the senistive screen subjectively make syou feel as if the OS is more responsive than on past devices. It just could be the case, but we won't know it before we see an implementation of the capacitive screen without the Snapdragon CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when it comes to image quality, it is nothing short of fantastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the large size of the display easily exposes the display's primary weakness - it limitation of 65K colors. There is easily visible color banding on multiple screens throughout the interface and on most of the preinstalled wallpapers as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another downer is that legibility under direct sunlight is far from perfect. The display mirror finish and the fingerprint smudges make it really hard to discern what's on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of hardware controls on the HD2 body has been increased over its predecessor. There are five hardware keys below the display now. The Menu key is the newcomer - it's mandatory for all WinMo 6.5 devices. Just as a comparison, the original Touch HD had only four keys instead (and they all were touch sensitive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The disparity between HD2 regular hardware keys and the sensitive capacitive screen that doesn't need any force to be applied certainly needs a little time to get used to but it's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the HD2 looks pretty nice. The steel battery cover and the fingerprint resistant plastic around it are certainly welcome on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the phone hosts the microUSB port, the microphone pinhole and the 3.5mm standard audio jack. Understandably there's no stylus this time. This is only the first phone by HTC to come equipped with a microUSB port. Up until now, they used the miniUSB variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there's no camera shutter key on the right side, much like there wasn't one on the Touch Diamond, Touch Diamond2 and the original Touch HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the HTC HD2 is the 5 megapixel camera lens, stuck between the loudspeaker grill and the dual LED flash. It's a good thing that HTC decided to do something about low-light shooting this time by including a LED flash but we would have really preferred a dedicated camera key instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens sticks out a mile and we didn't quite like how your index finger somehow always landed on the front glass. The lens protection also seems quite insufficient and if you carry your handset in the pocket, it would most definitely get scratched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the steel back cover reveals the 1230 mAh battery. Here, you'll find the reset pinhole along with the microSD card slot. The location of the card slot might not be good news to those of you that like using the card for transferring data.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchFLO 3D has been promoted to Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are fan of Windows Mobile devices, you're certainly familiar with the HTC's TouchFLO interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, HTC have decided to go to the next level and upgraded the old but still cool TouchFLO 3D with all heart-melting features found in the Sense UI pioneered on the HTC Hero. The result is a new Sense user interface resembling the tabbed TouchFLO with more sections and full of eye-candy animations. The only thing missing as compare to the Hero are the widgets, which you could freely move around the screen, but here you have tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Sense Home screen offers a choice of full screen tabs, decked out with some impressive graphics. You can move through the tabs with a single finger sweep, or by scrolling the colorful tab thumbnails at the bottom of the screen until you hit the one you need. It's the familiar list from the TouchFLO 3D UI but with a few new additions and includes the home screen (with a large clock and weather information and animations), favorite contacts, text messages, email, Internet, calendar, stock, photos and video, music, weather, twitter, footprints and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC refreshed the Home tab by adding your home city weather info along with the same eye-candy animations as in Weather tab, so the weather can come live in your handset. The other new addition to the Home tab is the shortcuts. You can assign quick links to almost everything in your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two new tabs are Twitter and Footprints. They both hardly need any introduction as both twitter and the HTC Footprints service have been around for quite some time. Footprints are geo-tagged photos stored with additional information such as a note, a name, a phone number, or a website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The huge capacitive screen on the HD2 is the first of its kind in a WinMo smartphone and HTC have put quite some effort into delivering a whole new touch experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All parts of the UI and the menus react immediately to your fingers without the need to apply any force to the screen. The transitions are fast and fluid and followed by nice animations. In fact, the capacitive screen, the Snapdragon CPU and the nice amount of RAM make this Windows Mobile 6.5 the fastest one around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another first for Windows Mobile are the multi-touch gestures. You can use the pinch gesture to zoom in the photos, web browser and Google Maps (so iPhonish). There is no lag while zooming and it's completely equal to the iPhone's zoom speed and smoothness. But that's understandable with that 1GHz Snapdragon inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another new feature on the HD2 as well - it's the pocket ring mode. Upon an incoming call, the phone automatically recognizes that you're carrying it in your pocket or purse and sets its maximum ringing volume so you won't miss the call. Neat indeed! It's not ground breaking functionality, but it's those little things (such as the HTC Touch Diamond magnetic active stylus) that really put the past HTC Innovation slogan in context.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia - HD playback is still a no-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery is the standard HTC one and except the multi-touch support, there is nothing new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more interesting part is the video playback. As usual you will need to install third-party application to watch DivX/XviD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much all videos under 720p played just fine without any dropped frames. The HTC HD2 has similar issues as Acer neoTouch and has even worse performance. While the neoTouch managed to play the 720p videos with 15-17 fps, the HD2 has an output of only 12-13 frames per second. Not that any of those is actually watchable but it gives you an idea. We guess the graphics subsystem of the Acer neoTouch has a few tricks under its sleeve and it's not a matter of pure CPU clock comparison.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel camera with VGA video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as the camera in concerned, the HD 2 packs 5 megapixel snapper with LED flash. The video recording goes up to VGA at 30fps and given the hardware inside we think it's not enough. The Omnia HD captures HD videos with far less powerful CPU and less RAM. And just like every other HTC handset, there is no geo-tagging from the camera options. You will need to do this manually with Footprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image and video quality are good enough and we guess, they will satisfy most of the users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser - Opera lacks Flash, IE lacks multi-touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 comes with the latest Opera browser. There's also IE Mobile 6 and strangely the choice between the two is not so obvious anymore with only IE having partial Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Opera browser is extensively touch-optimized and supports multi-touch. With that big and capacitive screen along with the powerful hardware, the web browsing experience on the HD2 is almost unmatched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages load quickly and look very good on the big screen, the pinch zoom is smooth and very fast with no visible lag. Scrolling through the page is also extremely fast and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick demo video of the Opera browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Opera does not support Flash, so you can't view Flash ads and videos. Internet Explorer on the other hand handles Flash banners very well. But watching Flash videos is still a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Opera, IE Mobile has two major flaws - there is no multi-touch support and it seems to load web pages twice as slow. Choosing between the two web browsers and their respective downsides will definitely be a matter of personal preference. We know we would go for Opera any time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Piloting around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC HD2 comes with Google Maps preinstalled (no navigation here) but besides GMaps there's also CoPilot 8 SatNav software. It's a trial version alright and you have to opt for a paid license if you intend to use it but it's still nice it comes preinstalled on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in digital compass enhances the digital map experience even further. The compass works in CoPilot, but not in GMaps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, it's not that everything in the mobile phones world revolves around the iPhone but we couldn't help but note that with HD2 HTC are the first manufacturer to outdo almost everything you'd find on the Apple's device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's ironic that it took the competition more than two years, twice the processor speed and twice the RAM to finally beat the UI styling and responsiveness of the iPhone. They still haven't got the hang of sunlight screen legibility, we admit. And the AppStore is miles ahead of any competing software distribution platform. But nonetheless, the HD2 is better, faster and stronger than the current golden standard of UI - the Apple iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC HD2 is the first in the long line of Windows Mobile smartphones to break the conservative tradition of using resistive display. But the HD2 does not stop at that. Its capacitive touchscreen is the biggest display ever put into a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have put a lot of work on software development to make the best out of Windows Mobile 6.5. Really, what is a capacitive touchscreen without multi-touch gestures? And HTC have pulled it off successfully. The image gallery, the Opera browser, Google Maps, and even CoPilot Navigator make use of the pinch zooming and it works flawlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, HTC HD2 won't justify its HD tag again. According to our tests so far, the handset is not capable of playing or capturing HD videos. But anyways, you don't need to watch 720p video on the 4.3-inch screen, WVGA one will do just as fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But somewhere there inside the HTC HD2 lives a real dragon. And it's got all the teeth, claws and fire breath to match every opponent the competition might send its way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll that's all about the HD2 that deserves mentioning in a brief preview article. We would surely be putting the HD2 through its paces in the coming days and we hope that this short article would be enough to keep you going while we work on our full-featured review.</paragraph>
