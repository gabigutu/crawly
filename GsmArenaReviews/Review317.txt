			<paragraph>The Nokia N81 is an exciting Symbian smartphone that comes loaded with multimedia capabilities and promises tons of fun. Flaunting 8 gig worth of storage, the Nokia N81 8GB comes in the slider form factor and features a nice 2.4" 16M color TFT display, 3G with video calls, Wi-Fi, a 2 megapixel snapper, stereo speakers, several dedicated music and gaming keys and finally, a unique Navi wheel D-pad that is unlike everything you've probably seen around in mobile handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we are currently working on the actual exclusive in-depth review of the Nokia N81 8GB (thanks to importgsm.com who provided us with the handset), we decided to lose no time but share with you our first impressions on one of the hottest multimedia handsets this winter season before the actual review is ready. We hope that in a few days we will be able to provide you with a full review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ok, we think we got you excited enough now. So feel free to browse along on for more of our Nokia N81 teaser review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Designed to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N81 measures 17.6 mm in thickness and weighs good 140 g. However it's surprisingly pocketable and it's real joy having it in our office. You may notice a rather strong resemblance to the Nokia 6110 Navigator, which we reviewed earlier. Now, as you may probably know there are two editions of the Nokia N81 to be produced - a vanilla one that comes with a microSD slot and a 1GB or 2GB microSD card in the retail package, and Nokia N81 8GB edition, which we got for testing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Nokia N81 8GB is dominated by the large 2.4" 16M color TFT display with QVGA resolution. As you know Nokia displays are our favorites. Currently, probably only the iPhone display outmatches those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will probably notice that all the keys are flush with the design lines. It must be noted that some of them are rather hard to press - some of them need a good, hard shove in order to get them to work. Otherwise, pretty much the whole bunch of the keys has a good tactile feedback. And when we say "bunch" we really mean it - the front panel hosts as many as 11 keys without counting the alphanumeric keypad that is. While some of them may seem touch sensitive at first sight, they are not (except for the Navi wheel that is).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Touching your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Navi wheel is probably the feature that brings the highest wow-factor with the Nokia N81. The thing is that the navigation D-pad allows touch sensitive input - by flowing your thumb along the lines of the silvery square you can scroll through the Gallery or the customizable Multimedia menu. It's incredibly pleasant to work with the Navi wheel and the onscreen performance usually matches the speed of your thumb, which makes things feel really natural. It even makes you wonder how come it's only now that we see such a solution for the first time from any mobile manufacturer. As an N-series offspring pictures, music and video is in the center of the Nokia N81. The user interface is rather zippy and we liked how it handled pictures in the Gallery - zooming, panning, and scrolling is really fast.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gaming platform<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N81 is the first device armed with the new N-Gage platform and it has plenty of storage to make use of it. The dedicated gaming keys can be spotted (eventually) at the top of the front panel. There are three games that come preinstalled with the Nokia N81 - the FIFA 2007, Asphalt 3: Street Rules, and Space Impact Light. Obviously, we have more to see of those games as a couple of them are even not officially published yet.</paragraph>
