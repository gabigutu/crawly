			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The razor-slim Huawei Ascend P6 has snatched the slimmest smartphone title right under the nose of the big guns. The China-based maker is not only keeping up with its high-profile competitors in terms of both hardware and software, but has achieved what few others have lately. The Ascend P6 offers a well-balanced feature set in a beautifully designed body, record-breaking thin at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 was introduced in June and is now officially hitting the shelves with its record still intact. The Ascend P6's signature feature is the phone's 6.2mm profile, edging ahead of even the impressively slim Sony Xperia Z Ultra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, there has been word of even thinner phones like the Vivo X3(5.6mm) and the Umeox X5 (5.6mm), but they're the kind of gadgets to give small-time Chinese makers their 15 minutes of fame rather than make a big splash globally. Huawei's vision, on the other hand, goes well beyond the home market - though what a market that is!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 is powered by the company's home-brewed chipset - the K3V2 - featuring a quad-core 1.5GHz Cortex-A9 processor, a 16-core GPU and 2GB of RAM. Having already seen this configuration on the Ascend Mate phablet, we can confirm that it's a more than adequate match for the 720p screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the full breakdown of the Huawei Ascend P6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there is very little the Ascend P6 fails to deliver. Some may find the non-removable battery unacceptable, but lots of manufacturers these days are resorting to a similar design in order to keep their phones beautifully slim, yet sturdy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For NFC and LTE, there's the Huawei Ascend P2, which was introduced early on in Barcelona. Actually, the jump from P2 to P6 is not to be construed as a massive improvement in terms of level of equipment. The two handsets are more like alternative versions for those with different design preferences. What's more important is that with the Ascend P series Huawei's looking quite solid in the upper midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's cut to the chase. Follow us on the next page where the Ascend P6 is given a thorough hardware inspection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Huawei Ascend P6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our retail package of the Ascend P6 came with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a headset and a semi-transparent rubber case, which fits well and looks reasonably good. The box itself is slim but wide, tucked into a cardboard sleeve, each accessory individually packed in its own container, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree view of Huawei Ascend P6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 measures 132.7 x 65.5 x 6.2 mm and weighs just 120 grams. Not only is it the thinnest smartphone we've handled, but also one of the lightest quad-core devices we've held to date.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The slim profile can certainly claim most of the credit, but the good looks of the Huawei Ascend P6 are a combination of features: the brushed metal finish of the rear, the curved bottom and the assertive angular frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is consciously minimalist, and even though we tend to prefer hardware Home keys, the neat button-free front of the Ascend P6 seems like the right choice for a phone this slim. The aluminum sides look suspiciously similar to the iPhone 4/4S design, but it's an accent that works well here and we didn't mind it at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unibody design has ruled out a removable battery, but has certainly contributed to the amazingly slim profile and good looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a 4.7" screen, the Huawei Ascend P6 is by no means a small device but the ultra-slim unibody feels refined and solid, yet surprisingly light. All bits fit perfectly together in a nearly seamless design and there are no cheap-looking accents whatsoever. The entire front is protected by a piece of Gorilla Glass, while the back is nicely textured like brushed metal. The frame around the sides is made out of aluminum. It's a combination that works quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handling of the Huawei Ascend P6 is excellent for a device this size. The matte back is nice and grippy, while the slim body certainly helps single-handed use. The Ascend P6 is quite pocket friendly too - something we rarely get with everyone's obsession with big screens. We used the P6 for quite a while and we have to admit, it's one of those devices that you can slip into a pocket, which you'll pat now and then to make sure it's actually still there. Oh yes, it's that light and compact!</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the navigation keys moved over to the screen, the things to note at the front of the Huawei Ascend P6 are above the 4.7" IPS+ LCD. There's a status LED and sensors left of the earpiece and a 5MP front camera on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yep, that's a five megapixel camera up there and Huawei is really proud of its front-facer. It's a fixed focus unit, but one that does some great portrait shots and has the Beauty Face option available. It also shoots 720p videos @ 30fps. We'll get into more detail there in the camera chapter of the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of controls, we've got a pretty crowded right side with a Power/Lock key and a volume rocker, followed by microSIM and microSD card slots compartments. These are small trays that take an eject pin to open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, as far as we know, there is also a regionally available Dual SIM version of the Ascend P6. In the dual SIM case, both metallic trays accommodate SIM cards and there is no microSD slot. To make up for that, the dual SIM version comes with 16GB of storage instead of only 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eject pin is inserted into the 3.5mm audio jack on the left-hand side of the device - that's an unusual solution, but we can see the point: that way the eject tool is always available and it also protects the port from getting filled with dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand though, one risks misplacing the eject tool every time they need to plug a headset -the tiny piece is really easy to lose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Huawei Ascend P6 accommodates the microUSB port and the secondary microphone, which is used for active noise cancellation in calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Across at the bottom, the primary microphone is the only thing of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens is placed in the top left corner of phone's back. The single-LED flash is next to it too. The discrete loudspeaker grille is in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 comes with a nice rubber case in the box that tightly wraps around the handset. The case is transparent so the phone's good looks aren't sacrificed and it will do a nice job of keeping it safe. It inevitably adds to the thickness though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 is powered by a 2000 mAh Li-Ion battery. The phone scored a very reasonable 46-hour rating in our real-life battery test. The moderately-sized screen and the energy-efficient chipset might actually deserve the credit for this good performance. Find the complete breakdown here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 has a 4.7" IPS+ LCD of 720p resolution. This works out to a pixel density of 312ppi, which is almost the same as what the Apple iPhone 5 has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 offers wide viewing angles with no color shift and little contrast loss when you view the display at an angle. The colors are spot on, the contrast is great and generally we are very pleased with the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen brightness control in the Android notification area is a single virtual key with four steps: Automatic, 100%, 50% and 0% brightness. There's no brightness slider as in competing Android devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hidden further down in the Display settings, there is an additional Smart Backlight toggle - this could be enabled to assure the automatic brightness control doesn't do rapid jumps when adjusting the illumination level. If switched on, the Ascend P6 will calculate the next light transition point in a bright lighting environment and maintain a gradient brightness variation .</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 also offers the rare option to adjust the screen's color temperature. It's a slider that gives you control on whether the screen has a cooler or warmer (blue vs. amber) tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the 4.7" IPS 720p touchscreen is also highly sensitive thanks to the Magic Touch tech, which allows you to use it even with gloves, a feature that will surely come in handy in cold weather.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, Emotion UI 1.6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, skinned with the home-brewed Emotion UI v1.6. The result is a very simple, flat interface with no app drawer (think iPhone style). It seems, it was Huawei's goal to make it as friendly and simple as possible rather than overhauling Android beyond recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already seen this software combo in action on the Ascend Mate phablet, though the new Android and Emotion UI versions on the P6 bring even more changes to the default apps. Also, some of the phablet-specific features we saw on the Mate are gone here because the Ascend P6 is a regular-size smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the user interface to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen has a slider that unlocks the screen if dragged to the right and starts the camera if you swipe it to the left. You can customize the lockscreen even further and you can setup a set of four-shortcuts, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the music player is running, the time and date on the homescreen are replaced by the music player controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts, which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens. The default selection is phone app, contacts, messages and Play Store but you can have any app really, or folders with multiple items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are nine homescreen panes at most - at least a couple of them will be populated by the app icons. In the absence of an app drawer, anything you install pops up on the homescreen - just as it would on an iPhone. Thus there is no need for creating shortcuts for your apps and the usual routine of removing the shortcut icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will actually uninstall the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't worry, the setup is fool-proof and you just can't accidentally uninstall essential apps like the gallery or email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside of the flat structure is you cannot get rarely used apps out of the way. Still, folders partially make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are available too - tap and hold on the homescreen, then choose Widgets. The Ascend P6 came only with the default Jelly Bean widgets, there are no custom additions by Huawei. Of course, you can get third party widgets off the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu displayed upon a tap and hold on the homescreen also lets you set wallpaper and homescreen transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live, static and scrollable static wallpapers are supported. You can activate the Shake to change wallpaper setting, or turn on Random change and set a specific time interval (5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, or every day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile. Unlike the Huawei Ascend Mate, the P6 has 5 lockscreen styles with only two different unlock gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can always opt for the default Android lockscreens - Face Unlock, Pattern, PIN or Password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also 5 completely different icon sets you can choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features up to nine toggles on a single side-swipeable row. Hitting More will reveal all the available toggles and you can choose which of the 15 toggles in total will be featured on the top row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Android notifications stack up below the toggles. The notifications can be expanded or collapsed with a pinch gesture. You can also swipe to dismiss a notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the Music Player or FM radio apps are running in background, media player controls will be available in the notification area too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Profiles setup, we first saw on the Huawei Ascend Mate, has evolved into a separate application. Pre-defined Normal, Sleep, Meeting and Outdoor profiles are available, but this time you can customize them or you can choose to create profiles of your own. Whatever your preference is, you can set volume levels, brightness, screen timeout, vibration for different notifications, and connectivity settings (mobile data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sync and GPS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a toggle on the notification area called Profiles. Upon a tap, a virtual dial appears to choose the setting you need: Normal, Outdoor, Meeting, Sleep, custom (if you've created such).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu has two tabs. The first one is called General and offers only a limited set of settings Huawei thought you'll use most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other tab - All Settings - has the default Android list of settings plus a few extra additions by Huawei.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Manager settings have been simplified a bit compared to the Mate's. It has three non-customizable modes - Smart, Normal and Endurance performance. You can configure independently what apps run at startup, as well as which apps are allowed to run in the background and which aren't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gloves mode toggle is available in the Settings menu too. If turned on, it will increase the touchscreen sensitivity so you can operate the Ascend P6 display with gloves, but this may reduce your battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on the Ascend Mate, Huawei has tweaked the Android's default task manager on the Ascend P6. Its interface is the same as the stock Android Jelly Bean task switcher, but offers a few extra options. Each app thumbnail now has a dedicated close key (in addition to the default swipe to close gesture). There is also a "Kill all" key at the bottom that will terminate all running apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the help of Android's Voice Actions, which come as part of Jelly Bean, can handle advanced stuff such as sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. You can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Huawei Ascend P6 gets activated with an upward-swipe from the virtual navigation bar. The gesture now works from the homescreen as well, unlike on the Ascend Mate where you could invoke Google Now only from an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to answer your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 is powered by Huawei's own K3V2 chipset. There are four 1.5GHz Cortex A9 cores, a 16-core GPU and 2GB of RAM. The Cortex A9 cores are already a dated piece of tech, but the quad-core setup is still quite capable of keeping Android running smoothly on a 720p screen. The Huawei Ascend Mate and Samsung Galaxy S III, for instance, use similar processors and they still gets the job nicely done without any hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with BenchmarkPi and Linpack, the Ascend P6 posted pretty good scores, on par with the Huawei Ascend Mate and the Galaxy S III. Of course, it wasn't able to match the more recent flagships in our database.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the multiple-core performance, the Huawei Ascend P6 behaved similarly to its quad-core Cortex-A9 powered rivals.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've added some GPU benchmarks for good measure to test out the undisclosed 16-core graphics chip inside the Ascend P6. Since we saw the same GPU in the Ascend Mate, we already knew the GPU isn't anything spectacular, and there were no surprises this time around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SunSpider benchmark tests JavaScript performance. The two browsers available on the Ascend P6 (the stock one and Chrome) scored totally different results. While Google Chrome scored somewhat similar to what we saw on other phones of quad-core Cortex-A9 generation, the default web browser did embarrassingly bad.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 phonebook is the same as the one we already saw on the Ascend Mate. It's laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one in the middle is the default tab, listing all contacts. Contacts are displayed with a name and a picture to the left. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with the first or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent alphabet scroll on the right to jump straight to contacts starting with a particular letter. There's a regular search field, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the contact image now brings up a tabbed popup. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers/addresses. These tabs can be swiped sideways too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view top row has a star to favorite a contact, a pencil to edit it, and a Settings button that lets you share, copy or delete a contact as well as set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is a list of all contact info sorted by category: phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more contact details. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even by group (so you can hide all contacts not in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call sound was good and loud and we had no issues with reception. The Huawei Ascend Mate features a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer offers a shortcut to the Contacts app and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Ascend P6 through our traditional loudspeaker test and it managed an Average score. You should keep an eye of your P6 in noisier environments in case you've turned the vibration off otherwise you might miss some notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - which can be mass-deleted - and each thread is displayed like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Ascend P6 to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 200 texts and 20 MMS per conversation). You can activate delivery reports, as well as read reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the first thing you'll notice is that Google has done away with the bottom bar that hosted buttons for new mail, search, labels, refresh and menu. Three of those have now been moved to the action bar on top while Refresh has been translated into a pull-down gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender on a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts, the ex-GTalk client, handles the Instant Messaging department. The new app is a massive update over the old GTalk and offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, history sync across multiple devices, and completely new UI design. It's available on iOS as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei keyboard is quite comfortable to type on. You can switch to the default Android keyboard if you prefer, but Huawei's is bigger, making it easier to type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei keyboard has a few very useful options. First, you can change the keys' height - there are four different settings available and you can make the keys really big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you swipe left or right on the keyboard you'll access the old-fashioned keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's keyboard also offers handwriting support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery does a great job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei Ascend P6 comes with an updated Jelly Bean image gallery. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders in the phone as stacks of photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view, you also get three additional tabs - Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), and People (if the photos have tagged faces in them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to show you that you've reached the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you view a single photo, you'll get Share, Delete and More Settings shortcuts above the photo. You can share a photo via DLNA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Picasa, MMS, Google+, Hangouts, Facebook, Twitter, Email and Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotation only) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more options. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles editing videos and it's quite feature-rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and trim their start and end points, you can add titles and effects (including transition effects), add music and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an app that can completely eliminate the need of a computer for most people when creating videos. Plus Apple charges a good amount of money for the same functionality with their iMovie app. Same goes for the image editor too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player integrated in the gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 doesn't have much of a video player - you just open videos from the gallery or the file manager and that's that. On the up side, it handled all videos we threw at it - all the way up to 1080p, DivX, XviD, MKV and even WMV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had no issues with sound either - AC3 and DTS codecs give most phones a headache - and there's Dolby Mobile 3.0+ available to enhance the audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video plus a Dolby on/off switch. That's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated video player (just like the Music player) offers non-customizable equalizer presets only when you plug a pair of headphones in. You can pop up the preset list with a tap on the Dolby Mobile virtual switch at the top of the Now Playing screen. In case you are using the loudspeaker, a tap on the Dolby logo will just turn on or off the Dolby Mobile enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles are supported, you just need to name the subtitle file the same as the video, though only Latin fonts will be displayed properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.7" HD display is great for watching movies on the go. In case you need more functionality, you can also download a third-party movie player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brand new music player with Dolby Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 comes with a brand new music player designed by Huawei. It offers four default playlists dedicated to your mood, but you'll have to assign songs to the mood playlists manually. There are also All songs, Playlists, Albums, Artist and Folders views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music app offers non-customizable equalizer presets only when you plug in a pair of headphones. You can get to the equalizer with a tap on the Dolby Mobile key at the top of the Now Playing screen. In case you are using the loudspeaker, the Dolby logo will only toggle Dolby Mobile on and off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna. We were disappointed not to find RDS - radio stations need to be named by hand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately it turned out that audio quality was one of the things Huawei had to sacrifice in order to fit the Ascend P6 in such a slender chassis. The smartphone couldn't even complete the first part of our traditional audio quality test due to its poor output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There weren't such issues when we plugged in a pair of headphones, but the output wasn't particularly great either. Frequency response and distortion levels were very good, but the signal-to-noise score and the dynamic range were somewhat low, while the stereo crosstalk was only average. To make matters worse, the Ascend P6 is one of the quietest smartphones we have tested to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent 8MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 has an 8MP camera for maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. There's a single LED flash to go with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks pretty standard - you get a still/video camera toggle, a virtual shutter and a shortcut to the gallery on the right. The fun stuff is on the left side though everything is hidden in the advanced menu. The only two shortcuts you get are for a switch for the front camera and flash options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the advanced menu you can choose between Single, Smart, Beauty, HDR, Panorama and Effect modes. The additional settings shortcut is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digging deeper into the settings you'll find object tracking, smile shutter, touch to capture switch, geo-tagging on/off, ISO, white balance, etc. We don't find this convenient and we definitely liked the old Huawei camera UI better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Volume Up key doubles as a hardware camera shutter inside the camera app. You can hold it to focus and it will take a picture upon release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers excellent levels of fine detail and manages to keep the noise in check. We've certainly seen better performing cameras in terms of noise levels, but these are acceptable. The colors are nicely saturated and the exposure is reliable, too. One thing to watch out for is the autofocus accuracy - we had several shots (more than usual, actually) which were out of focus. Just like with the Ascend Mate's samples, the P6 photos have quite soft corners, pointing to somewhat inferior lens quality. That's not that surprising; we've seen the same issue in the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini as well and it might as well be an isolated unit-specific case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out these HDR shots too. Keep in mind that you have to have a steady hand for those two to work properly. Unfortunately, steady hand or not, the results are far from impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a panorama sample. Note that the Ascend P6 is capable of taking 360-degree pano shots. The stitching is great, but it takes about 10 seconds to complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's front-facing camera snaps photos of 5MP. It's a fixed focus snapper but it's perfect for portrait shots you want to post to Facebook or other social network. It offers Beauty shot (skin smoothing effect) and Instagram-like color effects too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The synthetic resolution chart shows excellent results that can rival the best in the 8MP range. The noise-reduction is well-behaved, while white balance is quite accurate in artificial lighting. There's very good detail (and some oversaturated colors).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder does 1080p, 720p HDRs too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6's main camera records videos at up to 1080p@30fps plus 720p HDR videos, while the front facer is good for up to 720p@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is practically identical to that of the still camera. You lose the color effects option, but you can still enable the face effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are MP4 encoded at a bitrate of about 25Mbps for 1080p videos. There's stereo sound and the 30fps mark is consistently met.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really aren't pleased with the video quality and that ruined the nice impression from the still camera. The corner softness was way more evident on the videos compared to the photos and the videos are quite a bit more oversaturated than we would like. The framerate is smooth, but even in the sharpest central area, the level of resolved detail is not as high as it should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR videos look somewhat darker than their originals and loose contrast, but unfortunately don't bring any more detail that wasn't already available in the standard mode. We guess Huawei need to work on this department more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are is a 1080p video sample we've uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download the untouched 1080p@30fps sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 qualifies for the 1080p competition that's going on in our Video Compare Tool. The results are on par with the Huawei Ascend Mate and much better than Samsung's Galaxy S III.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses LTE and NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 comes with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and penta-band 3G, meaning you'll be able to use it pretty much anywhere in the world. 3G comes with HSDPA and HSUPA - for up to 21Mbps downlink and 5.7Mbps uplink. There is no LTE support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA TV or multimedia player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 3.0 is also available but there's no NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 also supports USB host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect mice/keyboards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web browser experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 comes with two excellent web browsers - the stock Jelly Bean edition and Google Chrome. The stock browser UI is quite minimalistic - you get the URL bar with a tabs and a settings shortcuts, and that's it. Hitting the Settings key reveals the rest of the controls - everything from searching on the page, saving to bookmarks to useful options like bypassing mobile sites, saving a page for offline reading and sharing a page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some interesting options. For example, you can set your search provider to be Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tab switching is handled in a similar way to switching between apps. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has Incognito mode (there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs). The other thing the browser does is preload search results when it's confident you'll click on them. These are two tricks borrowed from Google's desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls are available from the Labs settings, which reveal three controls (Tabs, URL, More) when you tap anywhere on the edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still prefer the Chrome browser because of its cross-platform sync capabilities. It's absolutely identical in terms of interface, features (sans the Quick Controls), and behavior. Sometimes it's even faster, as our benchmarks showed earlier in the review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Document editing is easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 comes with Polaris Office 4.0, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a document, you get plenty of options - from text size and formatting to text justification, lists, tables, an Excel formula editor and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has two tabs that handle the internal and external storage organized by folders. The app also handles ZIP files. It supports batch operations too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar features four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar. You can add multiple reminders for each event and search all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. World Clock, Stopwatch and Timer functions are available as additional tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a basic Notes app and a Sound recorder. There's a Weather app too, which offers weather info for multiple locations complete with beautiful animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the flashlight app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about 90 seconds to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks at the expense of some data traffic. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need a rough estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend Mate comes with Google Maps and Navigation (region dependent). Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is also an option even if you don't have Internet connection. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on, it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. There's no address search either in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab another app from the Google Play Store (ex-Android Market) - there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Huawei Ascend P6 has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Play Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 may be the thinnest smartphone on the market right now, but since that title is Huawei's to lose, it's actually a good thing that this sleek devices has a few more tricks in the bag too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 has got a solid built, it's good-looking and lightweight and it comes with a good enough 8MP camera, along with a 5MP front facer. There is also the MagicTouch that allows you to operate the screen with gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone also runs on a completely overhauled Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean edition thanks to Huawei's own Emotion UI. The Ascend P6 is snappy and delivers great smartphone experience on its 720p IPS+ display. The lack of an app drawer might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Huawei did a great job simplifying the user interface without sacrificing too many features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not to mention the proprietary add-ons the Chines have built into it, such as the phone profile switcher, the wealth of customizable themes, the enhanced power management capabilities, the office document editor, the customizable keyboard, the Dolby Mobile sound enhancement and the proper video playback codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really happy with what Huawei did with the Ascend P6. It's a unique and beautiful phone with a different take on the user interface that breaks the standard Android mold. There is something for everyone to like in the P6 and it's a phone that's definitely worth your consideration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P6 is not alone out there though. There are plenty droids with similar screen specs, though none of those competitors is as slim and lightweight as the Huawei Ascend P6 is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the lack of LTE or NFC bothers you, or you want an even better 13MP rear camera, you can sacrifice the memory expansion slot and get otherwise the same Huawei Ascend P2. The P2 has been around for a while, it costs the same amount of cash and is powered by the same chipset. Still, it's some good 2mm thicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei Ascend P2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has two droids with 4.7" 720p displays and quad-core processors - the Optimus G and the Nexus 4. Both devices have completely different interfacese, but they share the premium looks and materials. The Optimus G runs on Android Jelly Bean, but is heavily skinned with LG's proprietary UI, while the Nexus 4 is an official Google phone that offers the pure Android experience and timely updates. Both LG droids cost about as much as the Huawei Ascend P6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Optimus G E975 &#x2022; LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's last year flagship - the Galaxy S III - is another device to consider. As powerful as the Ascend P6, it's built around a 4.8" 720p Super AMOLED display and is still among the first Samsung devices to get software updates. The Galaxy S III costs about the same as the Ascend P6, but its plastic shell is not even close to matching the P6's exquisite styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no way we are ignoring HTC's last season's top dog either, the HTC One X+. It too packs a 4.7" 720p display and is powered by the similarly performing quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 platform. The smartphone runs Android Jelly Bean too, but the lack of a microSD slot and the uninspiring camera performance let it down. It's also slightly more expensive than the Ascend P6. On the positive side, it supports LTE and NFC, so if you need either of these connectivity options, you should really check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One X+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.6" 720p Sony Xperia SP is a great alternative to the Ascend P6 as well. It's some 50 euro cheaper and offers LTE and NFC, a memory card slot and a comparable 8MP still camera. Its CPU comes two cores short of the Ascend P6's home-brewed chipset but has the Krait architecture that has proven to offer far superior per-core performance. And the GPU of the Sony smartphone simply wipes the floor with that of its competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia SP</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LG Optimus 4X HD comes with an equally big 4.7" HD display, an equally powerful quad-core Cortex-A9 chipset and has (finally) been upgraded to Android Jelly Bean. The device has been available for more than a year now and it's been heavily discounted already, going for some &#x20ac;100 less than the newly released Ascend P6. The attractive price has made it a popular choice lately and we guess it's an important option for you to explore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 4X HD P880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's never easy deciding on a phone, but it's easy to acknowledge a good one. The Huawei Ascend P6 is a solid performer in its class - one that is certain to put pressure on the competition. On the other hand, Huawei and the Ascend P6 are dealing with little or no pressure, being the underdog in this race. It may be a role they enjoy but one they aren't keen on playing forever. And they've shown it consistently.</paragraph>
