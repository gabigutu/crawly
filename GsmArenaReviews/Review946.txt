			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the first smartphone developed entirely after Google's purchase of Motorola, the Moto X arrives under the spotlight carrying great expectations. The smartphone is Motorola's first multi-carrier, high-profile launch in the United States since the days when the RAZR was still a flip phone. More recently, the company's devices have mostly been Verizon exclusives in North America, but we are glad that's not the case with its latest flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Moto X, Motorola has taken a rather unorthodox approach towards designing a top-shelf Android smartphone. Instead of focusing solely on putting together the most powerful hardware available on the market, Motorola's engineers have put more emphasis on ergonomics and software goodies. To top things off, the Motorola Moto X will be built in the United States with an unprecedented set of appearance customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the key features of the Motorola Moto X and its turn offs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only a quick look at the spec sheet of the Motorola Moto X is enough to tell us that the handset is not the typical Android flagship. Based on hardware specs alone, the smartphone fits the shoes of today's lower mid-range Android offerings better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curiously, we can't help but see great similarity between Motorola's unusual approach towards the design of the Moto X and the philosophy used so successfully by Apple with the iPhone. The Moto X puts powerful hardware second, and focuses on ergonomic and user experience (the voice control operation) instead. It's certainly a gamble, but it's one that might pay off nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one Moto X feature which its manufacturer is boasting about the most is Moto Maker. It offers you the option to design your own Moto X by choosing from hundreds of combinations and you also get to tune your boot animation and wallpaper before you have even received the smartphone. It is a clear sign that innovation hasn't dried up at Motorola, but we are yet to see how well it will be received by the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we'll kick the review off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the device in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X ships in a small white box which sports Motorola's brand new logo. Inside it, you will find the phone, a charger, a USB cable, a tool for removing the nanoSIM card, and some booklets, but just like most smartphones in the US - no headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will be plenty of accessories available for the Motorola Moto X when it launches. Audio accessories by Sol Republic will be available straight from the Moto Maker - they include matching-color headphones and a wireless speaker. Protective cases from several major manufacturers will also be on offer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When viewed from the front, the Motorola Moto X can easily be mistaken for a Nexus smartphone due to the lack of any sort of branding. Things remain rather conservative on the back too. All you will find there is a small Motorola logo, as well as (in our case) a tiny AT&amp;T globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, it is impossible to talk about the design of the Moto X without paying significant attention to Moto Maker. Moto Maker is an online design studio which allows you to deeply customize the looks of your Moto X. There are two available options for the phone's front, 18 back colors, 7 accent colors and there will be the option to print a message on the phone's back later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto Maker is one of the main reasons why the Moto X will be assembled in the United States. Motorola has vouched to deliver the fully customized devices to you within four days after the order is placed. Such a feat would have been impossible if the device was assembled in China and needed to be shipped from there for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Software-wise, Moto Maker lets you put your own welcome message, preload an exclusive wallpaper, as well as login with your Google account in advance. The last feature is particularly neat, as it means that the Moto X will need practically no setup out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will even be able to choose a black or white charger for the device, and opt for the color-matched Sol Republic JAX in-ear headphones we mentioned earlier or protective case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to spend time with a Moto Maker demo. Having so many color options and the ability to combine them any way you like, is as much fun, as it is overwhelming. You can see how the customization studio works in the screen captures below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola is also testing out wooden back covers for the Moto X. They will be available in the near future, ready to fulfill the dreams of those with a knack for eccentric materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main downside of the Moto Maker is its limited availability. Only AT&amp;T customers will be able to take advantage of it right now, while subscribers of the other US carriers will only get the woven black (like our review unit) and woven white versions of the device. Woven stands for the faux texture on the back of the smartphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola has produced quite a few smartphones with great built quality and the latest addition to its lineup is no exception. The Moto X is impeccably put together. It consists of two "halves" - a soft-feeling polycarbonate back, and front section which is entirely covered in Corning Gorilla Glass. It feels sturdy and ready to take plenty of daily use and abuse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X features water-repellent coating. The latter has been applied even to the electrical boards inside the device, but wasn't enough to secure an IPX7 rating for the smartphone so you still need to be careful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X is fairly compact for a smartphone with a 4.7" display. It stands at 129.3 x 65.3 x 10.4 mm, meaning it's 8mm shorter and 3mm narrower than the HTC One, which has a display of the same size. Of course the HTC flagship has front-mounted stereo speakers and a slimmer waistline to make up for as well as hardware navigation keys rather than on-screen buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X weight tips the scale at 130 grams, which we found to strike a great balance and pocketability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X comes with a 720p AMOLED screen which is a departure from the current crop of 1080p units available on the device's competitors. Luckily, the screen uses a full RGB matrix, rather than the PenTile units on the previous Motorola smartphones. This means that when looked in isolation Moto X display certainly doesn't feel lesser. The difference can be spotted when placed side by side with today's top-end screens but it's not huge by any standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The product development managers of the Moto X were clear that it wouldn't have been an issue to put a 1080p display unit on the smartphone. Going with the lower resolution option however, helps a lot with the battery life, as well as the GPU performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, the screen has excellent image quality, which makes you instantly forget any issues you might have with its resolution (and you probably shouldn't have any). Contrast is as perfect as you've come to expect from an AMOLED screen, colors are nicely punchy and viewing angles are super wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display also offers great tactile feel. It features tapered edges to give a really natural feeling when handled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display is where the earpiece, the front-facing camera, as well as the ambient light and proximity sensors reside. A mouthpiece sits alone below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nano-SIM tray is located on the left of the handset. The volume rocker and the power/lock key are located on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is located in the middle of the Moto X's top. One of two dedicated noise-cancelling microphones is sitting by its side. The USB port sits alone at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The F/2.4 lens of the 10MP ClearPixel camera is flanked by a loudspeaker on the back of the Moto X. The single-LED flash sits below it. A Motorola logo, small AT&amp;T globe, and the second noise-cancelling microphone complete the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X features a 2200mAh battery. It has been custom-shaped to take full advantage of the space inside the device, so it is said to deliver 31% more capacity than a conventional battery. That's what the press materials say anyway - given the over 10mm of thickness and its non-user-accessible nature, the battery capacity certainly isn't all that impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola didn't offer any specific numbers for the battery performance. The product managers did however, specify that the goal with the device was to make it through full 24 hours of use without breaking a sweat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Moto X through our traditional battery test. The device achieved an endurance rating of 39. This means that the Moto will make well beyond the intended 24 hours if used for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Moto X posted far from great endurance rating, we ran one more test for the device with Active Notifications and Touchless Control turned off. With the new setup, the Moto X posted a slightly better endurance rating of 44.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the relatively small endurance gain, we would recommend that you leave the Active Notifications and Touchless Control on. Both features add substantially to the Moto X?s appeal, they don?t deserve to be left without a tick in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the full battery performance breakdown of the Moto X in our dedicated post over here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X could very well be the best-handling Android smartphone in its display size category. Motorola has spent a great deal of research on the anatomy of the human palm before they came up with the curved back shape of the Moto X. The end result is a device which feels natural and reassuring to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, thanks to the almost complete lack of side bezels, the Moto X can be handled with one hand by everyone with at least averagely-sized hands. This one achievement is arguably one of the most impressive feats of design on the entire device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Moto X deserves nothing but high marks for build quality and ergonomics. We'd be taking a couple of points off the design score due to the lack of expandable storage and non-user-accessible battery, but it still remains pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Maker studio should allow even the most pretentious users to have the phone "their way" (as long as their way is AT&amp;T, of course).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite being developed entirely under Google's supervision the Motorola Moto X comes running Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean out of box instead of the latest 4.3 release. Motorola have left the user interface mostly unchanged and the handset feels a lot like a Nexus smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see a quick rundown of the Moto X's UI in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen in Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean features the same large dotted circle around the center-placed padlock button. Lockscreen widgets are present on the Moto X. They are full-screen, resizable tiles, one of which is always visible at the top of the main lockscreen, above the padlock icon. The rest are a swipe to the right away. The one on the main lockscreen is collapsed to make room for the padlock button, but can be expanded to display additional information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a large variety of third-party lockscreen widgets and a few stock ones: Messages, Calendar, Gmail and Digital Clock. The camera shortcut, previously located at nine o'clock on the unlock circle is now a stand-alone widget, a swipe to the left away from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lockscreen widgets are resizable - tap and drag down to expand and show more content, if available. Lockscreen widgets can also be reordered by tapping and dragging, so you can choose which one is visible on the main lockscreen. They can also be dragged up to discard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are multiple unlock patterns to choose from: simple slide, pattern, pin or password, and face unlock. The lockscreen could even be skipped altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once unlocked, you're welcomed with the familiar homescreen interface introduced in Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock is customizable and features two shortcut icons on either side of the app drawer key. You can have folders there, each with multiple shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean isn't just business and no play. Google's Daydream is a fun twist on the screensaver concept. Once turned on, you can set it up to show photo albums or the latest news from Google Currents when the device is either docked or idle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the notification center you'll find Quick toggles. They're accessible via an icon in the top right corner of the notification area. You get access to key device settings such as brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Battery. Some toggles are directly accessible shortcuts to their respected functions in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick settings menu can be accessed by a two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has added a bit of personalization to the Quick Toggle panel in the notification area. Your name and photo are displayed but only after you've logged in to Google+ or after you've manually set them yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe, and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the major features which Motorola added to the Moto X is Active Display. It is on by default, and shows the time and the phone's notifications fading in and out when you take the phone out of your pocket. You can use the icons to go straight to the related apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of five panes to fill with shortcuts, folders and widgets. More often than not, the latter are resizable in all directions in order to fit any tight space. To resize a widget, you tap and hold and then release. Four handles will appear on its sides, allowing you to change the widget's size in the direction you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders haven't been changed since Ice Cream Sandwich and function as you'd expect. A folder is created by dropping a shortcut on top of another and can be named by tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only as much as needed to fit the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folders themselves are circular with the shortcuts inside drawn as if they are in a line One behind the other and you're looking at them at an angle (complete with perspective). They are lined up so the first shortcut in the folder will be the only one unobscured - the rest of the icons are nearly impossible to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer of the Moto X consists of four rows of icons. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets, each with side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you move into the Widgets tab. There's also a Market shortcut next to the tabs, for quicker access to Android's app repository.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps and widgets are ordered alphabetically and there's no other sorting option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing a shortcut or widget on the homescreen works as you would expect: press and hold to grab it and then position it on the homescreen pane of choice. Two more options appear at the top of the screen while you're dragging - Uninstall (to quickly remove apps) and App info, which opens the application's entry in the Manage applications list. Drop the app or widget on either One to activate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the Recent Apps list has remained virtually unchanged, save for some optimizations in load time and a few neat animations here and there. It all adds up as a really polished user experience and feels fantastic. It would be nice if Google adds a kill/close all option though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean offers a polished and smooth user interface and runs nicely smooth on the Moto X. The OS is getting now offering more of the now-considered essential features which OEM skins like Sense 5, Nature UX and Optimus UI have been having for a while now, and it's interesting to see Google's spin on them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now taken another step up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced back in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting additions in the OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your daily routine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by holding the home button and gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now in the form of cards. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean 4.2.2, Google Now has become even smarter and, if you allow it, can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts) and what distance you've walked in a particular month. The last one could definitely feel creepy for some users, but it's easily turned off from the Google Now settings menu. The latest addition to Google Now cards are TV and Offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Motorola wasn't happy with just that and has taken Google Now to a whole new level with the Moto X. Dubbed Touchless Control, the service is now always active and can be activated without even unlocking the smartphone - it is done by saying "OK, Google Now." That is enabled by a dedicated contextual computing core which has been developed by Motorola.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a duo of noise cancelling microphones on board, the voice-activated Google Now worked like a charm even in noisy environments. Before you start you set teach the service to recognize only your voice, so having someone else activate it with the universal command is usually impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchless Control is optional. It can be enabled and disabled from the Moto X's settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google Now is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola likes to call the Moto X chipset X8 and claims that it is a custom-developed 8-core unit. That's hugely misleading though, since as far as actual computing power is concerned this is a very standard S4 Pro chipset with two Krait cores clocked at 1.7GHz, 2GB RAM and the Adreno 320 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-core performance as measured by benchmarks is about what you can expect - it's the same as the Sony Xperia SP (which uses the same chipset) and about 30% slower than Snapdragon 600-powered smartphones .</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi-threaded performance is a little over a half of the Snapdragon 600 performance, according to Linpack and that's hardly surpsing to anyone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Geekbench 2 processing and memory speed test the Moto X was slightly closer to the Snapdragon S600 elite competition - 22% slower than HTC One and 34% slower than the Galaxy S4 - not quite what you'd expect from a smartphone more expensive than both of those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compound benchmarks like AnTuTu and Quadrant tell a very similar story - the Moto X is a snappy device but some way off the Snapdragon 600 chipsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPU performance is the strongest suit for the Moto X - it has a quad-core Adreno 320 GPU, which is the same as the one used in the current crop of 1080p flagships. The 1080p offscreen performance turned out about with the top dogs and when you consider that the Moto X only has to push 720p resolution to its screen, you can see that it will handle every game with unrivaled smoothness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browser performance turned out excellent too. JavaScript performance is about average (when compared against 2013 flagships), but the Vellamo test yielded an excellent score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two ways to look at the Moto X hardware performance. On one hand the smartphone is hardly a scrub and its GPU is on par with the big boys. On the other however, it has half the CPU cores and that shows in many of the tests - we wouldn't mind those scores if they came from a mid-ranger, but at this price point they are somewhat disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong - lag is unfamiliar territory for the Moto X and the smartphone goes about its daily duties with ease, but the relatively limited CPU power is bound to show up when faced with more demanding tasks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is the stock Android app People, which hasn't been changed since its major redesign last year with the introduction of Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's made up of three tabs that you can switch between with sideways swipes. The middle tab is the default one, listing all of your contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name, and viewed as first name or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's regular search as you type too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick contacts feature triggers on tapping a contact image to bring up a tabbed popup window. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers or addresses. These tabs can be navigated with sideways swipes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view displays the contact's name along with a star to favorite a contact and a Settings button that lets you edit, share or delete a contact, as well assign custom ringtones to them or set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under that is a list of all contact info sorted by category - phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts that the phonebook displays can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even group (so you can hide all contacts that don't belong in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two major tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is readily thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In-call quality of the Moto X is superb. Voices come out loud and clear and the device held on to signal without issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features the neon-blue on black theme, but hasn't grown any new functionality. There's still no smart dialing, which is a real shame and frankly getting annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is the first tab of the phone app, the other two being the Call log and the Favorites tab (you get the same in the Phonebook). In the Call log, you can't delete individual entries, which is mind-boggling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual but with some improvements. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. A cool new feature is that you can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts work here too and there's a call shortcut at the top of the screen when viewing a thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Moto X to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 500 texts and 50 MMS). You can activate delivery reports and read reports too (they are notifications that the receiver has read the message).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is still frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only up to three lines, which makes working with longer texts hard. We mostly let it slide on previous versions, but with a 4.7" screen there's no excuse not to make the text box bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app now features color coded sender images, based on the first letter of the sender's name. This lets you easily see who your most popular email correspondences are with. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A recent major update of the app also automatically sorts out your incoming messages into three inboxes - primary, social, and one for promotional emails. We found it to work like a charm - it makes sorting through email messages much easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard has plenty of room to stretch its legs on the 4.7" screen and typing is very easy. Keys get even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the long screen becomes very comfortable for two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean 4.2.2 Google introduced a new typing method called Gesture typing. It works in a manner very similar to Swype -- you just Swipe your finger over the letters you want to type, lifting after each word is complete. Naturally, the Gesture Typing feature benefits from the already existing Android word prediction, so you can just click on the words the keyboard suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a "handle" attached to the text cursor - it's easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A double tap will bring up the select options - select word and select all - with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a word has a typo, it will be underlined in red and when you tap it, the phone will offer a number of suggested corrections along with options to add the word to the phone's dictionary or just delete the word.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery in Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean retains its ICS looks and functionality. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, the first of which is always the Camera album, which has a camera overlay icon too. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is the Make available offline feature - it lets you easily select multiple online albums and download them for offline viewing. The Gallery app supports online albums like Picasa (but not Facebook) and you can set it to sync photos only over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the single photo view is updated too - above the photo are several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while the underlying line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album isn't present any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more option. The editor can be accessed from a small icon from the bottom left hand-side corner and offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player has good codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has retained its stock Android interface. Motorola however, have added much better codec support than the one found in Nexus devices. The video player is now perfectly usable out of the box - it plays a host of formats which include H.263, H.264, MPEG4, VC-1, VP8 in up to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also wirelessly sharing videos with a Wi-Fi enabled TV. The feature relies on the good ol' DLNA technology to connect and the Miracast protocol for streaming. It's another feature most customs launchers had, but is only now making its way to the platform itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music streams and stores your music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is on board the Moto X. It went through a major UI overhaul and is now snappier and more beautiful. It features the spanking New Listen Now feature which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music also gives you the option to upload music onto the Google-branded cloud and stream it on your device via Wi-Fi or mobile data. There's also the nifty option of downloading the content onto the device if you want to have there for connection-less times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is working, the lockscreen features the album art and track info for the current song along with simple playback controls. The notification area also lets you control the playback via an expandable notification.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X did quite well in our audio test, demonstrating output worthy of a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the smartphone showed great dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio and stereo crosstalk. Its frequency response could be better in the lowest and highest frequencies but was close to perfect for the rest of the range, and while the intermodulation distortion was slightly high, harmonic distortion was absent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great news is, besides some extra stereo crosstalk, there's virtually no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. And with the volume levels pretty high in both tests, the Moto X earned an excellent mark here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ClearPixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the most interesting bit about the Motorola Moto X is its unique 10MP image sensor, which makes use of what Motorola calls "ClearPixel" technology. It uses 1.4-micron pixels (same size as 8MP cameras), but instead of an RGBG matrix it uses a RGBC matrix, which should capture 75% more light. Also, the sensor has a native 16:9 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regular camera sensors employ a filter grid layer in front of the image sensor pixels. The filters' job is to single out the individual colors of light (RGB - red, green, blue) and allow for only one color of light to reach any given pixel on the sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most widely used type of filter arrangement in modern-day cameras is the Bayer filter arrangement, which follows a filter pattern of 2 green pixel filters, 1 red pixel filter and 1 blue pixel filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X camera, however, replaces one of the two green filters with clear, transparent one. This results into more light reaching the sensor - up to 75%, as Moto claims.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the conventional image sensor still needs the green light information, the image processor has the task of providing it. It supplies it by subtracting the red and blue light information from the full spectrum light, captured by pixels under the clear filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera can be activated by a simple hand gesture. Dubbed Quick Capture, the feature works by twisting your wrist twice when holding the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side, the camera offers HDR, burst shots and panorama. The Moto X can also shoot full HD videos at 30fps - par for the course for high-end smartphones these days. There are also features like face detection and geo-tagging that we've grown accustomed to in most phones nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI of the Moto X is quite simple. It relies completely on sliding gestures for zoom and settings - sliding from the left opens the settings, while sliding from the right opens the image gallery. Zoom works by sliding your finger up and down the screen. Capturing an image is as easy as tapping on the screen in auto mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of the innovative interface, the Moto X features a quick camera tutorial, so that you can get acquainted with the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the front of the Moto X, there's a 2MP camera capable of 1080p video recording which serves for video-chatting purposes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stills are in 16:9 aspect ratio, which is the native aspect of the sensor. The images turned out pretty nice with decent detail levels and noise kept under control. We did notice quite a lot of purple fringing, though, suggesting less than perfect optics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro seems to work like a charm (note the flowers) and colors turn out punchy and nicely saturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up we have a comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the Motorola Moto X in low-light conditions. The Moto X did get better exposure and produce an image with significantly less noise, but the detail levels on the two devices are basically on par. Still less noise at equal sharpness is quite the commendable achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the next two we enabled the flash units on the two smartphones. The Moto X loses its advantage here, as the seemingly brighter flash of the Galaxy S4 helps it match the output of the Moto X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera captures only 1080p videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The UI of the video camera has remained unchanged. Video capture begins by pressing the button located in the top right corner of the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample we captured with the Motorola Moto X on a busy street. Everything flows fluidly and there's plenty of detail to go around. Colors are accurate and focus never seems to miss and is quick to lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also captured a slow-motion video with the Moto X. The smartphone stretched 15 seconds of "regular" footage into a minute-long clip. You can see it below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users should be aware that the Moto X is set to capture only 1080p videos and there's no option to go for a lower resolution. These videos take quite a lot of space so anyone with a knack for mobile videography should go for the version with 32GB of built-in memory.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fully covered connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X starts off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE, quad-band 3G, and LTE compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device uses Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi support which includes a/b/g/n/ac band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the device and other NFC-capable devices back-to-back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is in charge of web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X comes with Google Chrome as a default web browser out of the box. The interface hasn't changed since Chrome's launch for Android and - it is clean and minimalist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop buttons next to tabs and settings buttons. You can switch between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the simple UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous on settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi access, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's options, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Quickoffice comes preinstalled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default office editor of the Moto X is Quickoffice. It opens and edits all popular file formats with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar's look hasn't changed drastically and its functionality is as good as ever. There are four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events. Recently Google added color-coding to events, which helps with organizing tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has redone its Clock app, giving it a major overhaul. Opening it brings you to your local time giving you the ability to add as many additional world capital cities as you'd like (they will also be visible on your lockscreen widget upon expanding).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present, albeit the fresh new design. You can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat pattern, ringtone and label. The app also comes with a stopwatch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stock Android isn't big on organizing but you can find pretty much anything in the Google Play store. Note apps like Google Keep or Evernote, different calendars, different office viewers, calculators, anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For added security, the Moto X comes with a feature which allows you to locate, lock, and even wipe your lost or stolen device. A prompt to activate it appears in the notification area when you first power up the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Assist, as its name, suggests helps users with their most common daily tasks. It helps to avoid interruptions while driving, during a meeting, or when the users are sleeping. Each of the activities can be set separately according to the user's preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X also ships with a dedicated app which allows users to transfer their data from an older device. It is called Migrate and can be downloaded on your older device from the Play Store. Once you set it up in your older Android device, you can transfer text messages, call history, SIM contacts, multimedia, and even volume and screen settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Google Earth will show you around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start (it supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks too). You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest update of the app brought updated interface, as well as an "Explore" feature which allows users to search for restaurants, hotels, shopping destinations, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play store has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, the Moto X has access to the latest available apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X certainly is a smartphone full of character. Instead of following the established trend set by high-end Androids over the years, it dares go where no other handset has gone before. It may not look the flagship part on paper but it very much feels like one in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the day it broke cover, pundits and consumers alike have criticized the Moto X's lack of top-tier SoC and display. After wrapping up our review, we have to say that those aren't as bad as they are portrayed to be. The device will very rarely feel underpowered and the screen is still pretty great. Future-proofing is a whole other story of course, and it's probably one that Motorola isn't too keen on telling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ergonomics of the Motorola Moto X are among its most potent weapons - despite not being particularly slim, the smartphone handles better than just about any other high-end droid. We are also glad to report that, while the Moto X brings few changes to the stock Android experience, they all work great. From the always active voice commands, through the Active display to the innovative camera-launching gesture - it's all working as Motorola promises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another big draw of the Moto X is the Moto Maker design studio. If nothing else the hundreds of combinations that you can preview in detail on your screen will serve as great promo for the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest flaw of the Motorola Moto X as far as its smartphone skills are concerned is the lack of expandable memory. The 16GB version comes with only 11.9GB available - hardly sufficient considering the fact that a high-end mobile game can easily take over a gig of space. The 10MP only stills from the camera don't help the cause either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has tried to offset the limited storage by offering 50GB of free Drive cloud storage, but that's hardly an optimal solution. The far better solution is for you to spend an extra $50 for the 32GB version of the Moto X. Which leads us to our main issue with the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As if it wasn't bad enough that Motorola is only going to sell the Moto X only in the US, the company has also made the 32GB version and the Moto Maker exclusive to AT&amp;T. The other major carriers are getting a smartphone that's not only more expensive than its better-spec'd rivals, but also deprived of two of its most valuable arguments. Motorola might have as well made this one an AT&amp;T exclusive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So assuming you do the sensible thing and go for the 32GB Moto X from AT&amp;T you should be ready to part with $249.99 and sign a new two-year commitment. And as every deal, this one can only be ruled good or bad when you see what else you can get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we must begin with the HTC One, which is the other 4.7" flagship worth your attention. Currently available for $150 less than the Motorola, the One offers a far snappier chipset and an aluminum unibody, which while not customizable is as least as good looking as the Moto X's chassis. You also get Beats stereo speakers and a bunch of software goodies exclusive to the Sense 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the Samsung Galaxy S4, which about $40 cheaper than the Moto X for the 32GB version. Even better you can leverage on its microSD card slot and get a 16GB version plus an extra card and save even more cash. You'll still be getting more capable hardware, a better camera and a user-replaceable battery, but you'd be losing in terms of looks and ergonomics if you side with the Samsung flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you are willing to go contract-free devices, we must point to the Nexus 4 - another Google offspring. Costing $350 , this one is far cheaper than the Moto X unlocked version will be when it arrives, but it doesn't go any higher than 16GB of internal storage. You'd be getting more capable hardware and timelier Android updates, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have probably noticed by now, that the Moto X has no chance of matching its rivals in a hardware for your buck fight. It's nowhere near as impressive in terms of internal hardware as its price tag suggests and things will only get worse in a couple of months when the Snapdragon 800 monster army arrives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the superior ergonomics, the unrivaled customization and the cool exclusive features still give the Motorola Moto X a lifeline. It now remains to be seen whether or not there will be enough AT&amp;T subscribers who value those enough to pay the premium and turn the Moto X into a success.</paragraph>
